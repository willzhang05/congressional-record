0,TRIBUTE TO IAN JACKSON,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1487-5,0,Mr. RUBIO," Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today I honor Ian Jackson, the 
Volusia County Teacher of the Year from T. Dewitt Taylor Middle-High 
School in Pierson, FL.
  Ian is an Advancement Via Individual Determination teacher, working


with students from 8th to 12th grade and considers it his job to change 
the trajectories of his students for the better. After receiving this 
award, Ian noted that it was not just him being recognized, but also 
his students for their success.
  Ian urges his students to strive for greatness in their middle school 
and high school coursework in preparation for the college workload. He 
focuses on ensuring his classroom feels like a second home to his 
students when they struggle and are in need of support.
  Many of Ian's students come from difficult circumstances, so he works 
to establish strong relationships and create a positive environment for 
them. He dedicates his time to listening to the needs of his students 
and conveying to them that he cares about their well-being. Eighty 
percent of his students are accepted into 4-year universities and many 
stay in contact with him through college and beyond.
  Ian has taught at T. Dewitt Taylor Middle-High School since 2005. He 
previously taught English as a second language classes in Georgia. He 
earned his bachelor's degree from Tocca Falls College.
  I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Ian for his dedication to 
helping his students succeed in life. I look forward to learning of his 
continued success in the coming years.

1,REASSURING EUROPEAN ALLIES,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2110-6,0,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina,"  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week I was grateful 
to join Senator Lindsey Graham on a delegation for the Munich Security 
Conference. A highlight was Vice President Mike Pence reaffirming 
America's commitment to the Transatlantic Alliance.
  I then joined the delegation led by Congressmen Gerry Connolly and 
Rick Larsen for the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.
  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reassured our allies of bipartisan support 
for NATO's continued success. Congressman Mike Turner ably presided as 
vice president of the assembly.
  Another highlight in Brussels was to meet with U.S. Ambassador Ronald 
Gidwitz and his wife, Christina, whose enthusiasm for service is 
extraordinary.
  The ambassador is promoting the restoration of the Mardasson 
Memorial, honoring American servicemembers in the Battle of the Bulge.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.

2,HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ANNE MARIE LABELLE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE209-5,0,Mr. HASTINGS,"  Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
legacy of Anne Marie Labelle. Anne was a wonderful mother, sister, 
grandmother, great grandmother and aunt. She was a selfless community 
advocate and will always be remembered for her strength and love of 
family.
  Anne was born in Troy, New York before moving to Broward County, 
Florida as a teenager. After high school, Anne became known for her 
activism in Sunrise city politics, before retiring far too young after 
suffering a stroke in 1982. In typical Anne fashion, she fought hard in 
rehab and recovered to work for local real estate developers in 
Plantation and Boca Raton. Anne was appreciative of those who helped 
her in her time of need, so she started volunteering at the Sunrise 
Rehabilitation Center and became a popular one-on-one volunteer for 
victims of stroke rehabilitation and brain injuries. She served on the 
hospital's community advisory board, while also volunteering with 
Shake-a-Leg, a group for individuals with disabilities who sailed 
monthly on Biscayne Bay.
  Madam Speaker, Anne's commitment to her community is a true testament 
to the person that she was. Anne will be remembered by the lives that 
she touched during her 77 years on this earth. Many fond memories of 
her will forever remain with her sons, Robert and Michael, her sister, 
Maureen, her grandchildren, Amanda, Matthew, Courtney, Casey, and 
Kelly, her great-grandchild, Parker, and her nieces and nephews, Ryan, 
Lauren, Grant, Logan and Abby. Anne's love for her family will be 
forever enshrined in her last words to her son, Robert, when she told 
him `tell everyone I love them'. I offer my deepest condolences to her 
entire family during this time of great sadness. Anne was truly a 
blessing to our community. I am so pleased to honor her memory. She 
will be dearly missed.

3,RECOGNIZING THE 27TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KHOJALY MASSACRE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE212-6,0,Mr. COHEN,"  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this week marks the 27th anniversary of the 
massacre of hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly in what was the 
largest killing of ethnic Azerbaijani civilians in the course of the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Khojaly, which is located in the Nagorno-
Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, was once home to 7,000 people. That was 
before Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 unarmed people--
including 106 women and 83 children--and left less than 2,000 
survivors. Hundreds more became disabled due to their horrific 
injuries. More than one hundred children lost a parent and 25 children 
lost both parents. At least 8 families were completely killed.
  Even though a ceasefire went into effect over two decades ago, more 
than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh 
and seven surrounding districts, remain occupied and more than 1 
million


Azerbaijanis remain refugees unable to return to their home villages. 
Ongoing violence along the line of contact surrounding occupied 
Azerbaijani territory reinforces the urgency of robust American 
participation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group as it works toward a peaceful resolution of 
the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict.
  Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the United States and its 
allies in security and energy matters. This cooperation has included: 
playing a leadership role in nonproliferation issues; providing troops 
to serve shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. forces in Kosovo, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan; allowing transit of non-lethal equipment used by coalition 
forces through Azerbaijan to Afghanistan, construction of the Southern 
Gas Corridor from the Caspian Sea to Italy, thereby providing Europe 
with an alternative to Russian energy sources; and supplying 40 percent 
of Israel's oil. Azerbaijan also has a thriving Jewish community and 
has outstanding relations with Israel.
  As Azerbaijanis throughout the world commemorate the massacre and 
continue to grieve the loss of loved ones, let us commit ourselves to 
supporting non-violent efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict.

4,ENSURE HEALTH PLANS COVER MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2111-2,0,Mr. RIGGLEMAN,"  Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for Kannon Koser, a 
constituent and friend of mine who is with his family in the gallery 
this afternoon.
  Mr. Speaker, 3-year-old Kannon is one of 4 percent of children in the 
United States who is born with a congenital anomaly--in his case, 
hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
  Most health plans provide coverage for congenital anomalies, and many 
States require insurers to provide coverage of any health services 
related to congenital anomalies.
  Despite this, health plans systematically and routinely deny claims 
and appeals for any oral or dental related procedures under the 
pretense that such service is merely cosmetic.
  That is why Representative Collin Peterson and I have joined together 
to introduce the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act, a bipartisan bill that 
would directly address this issue and ensure that we don't have to tell 
children like Kannon that their health condition isn't valued by 
insurance companies.

  As the original sponsor on the Republican side, I am proud to put my 
name on this bill and ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support it.
  ELSA would ensure all health plans cover medically necessary 
services, including reconstructive surgeries that are a result of 
congenital anomalies or birth defects.
  If enacted, this life-changing bill will allow the Koser family the 
opportunity to save for Kannon's college rather than spend money on 
reconstructive surgery.
  Commonsense reforms like this will help children like Kannon grow up 
healthier and have a better quality of life.

Schweikert) for 30 minutes.",,2019-02-26
7,FIVE PILLARS OF WHAT WE BELIEVE SAVES US,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2229,1,Mr. SCHWEIKERT,"  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, many of us really appreciate when you 
stay here and listen to us because we know a lot of folks out there 
don't appreciate it. It is sort of a gift of your time to be with us. 
When we were in the majority, I spent much of my freshman term sitting 
in that chair.
  What we are going to do tonight is this sort of a continuation of a 
theme. We have already heard tonight, and over the last couple weeks, 
discussions of debt, discussions of what is happening in Medicare, and, 
actually, I want to come here behind this microphone and talk about 
what I believe is a solution.


  I genuinely believe over the last few years, we have put together at 
least the backbone of enough math to talk about the reality. But let's 
first sort of set up the discussion if you haven't watched some of our 
other floor presentations since the beginning of this session.
  Every week, every other week, we try to take a half an hour and walk 
through our five pillars of what we believe saves us. Understand, in 9 
years, 50 percent of all of the noninterest spending that this Congress 
will do will be to those 65 and over.
  Understand, in 9 years, the 74 million baby boomers will actually be 
in their benefit cycle. They will be 65 and up.
  In 9 years, two workers for one retiree. And when you start to look 
at the future of our debt, understand--and this is hard because so many 
don't want to hear it, and it is not Republican or Democrat, it is 
demographics. If you look at our society, we are getting older very 
fast; our birth rates have substantially collapsed. Family formation, 
we have some real issues out there.
  So what do you do as a society? We have promises that have been made, 
earned entitlements out there, your Social Security, your Medicare, and 
you have earned those. That is part of your societal contract with this 
government, but we don't have the cash to pay over the next 30 years.
  How do we get there? I am going to tell you. I am still optimistic 
there is a path. I see some of these slides and these boards through 
the eyes of my daughter. I have a 3-year-old daughter. Best little girl 
ever. We actually have a coffee mug at home that says that.
  Doesn't she have the right to live as well as the generations that 
have gone before her? Doesn't she have the right to have that sort of 
optimistic opportunity? I actually believe that is not lost in our 
society. But as you even saw on the floor today, we do political 
theater here because complex policy is hard. It actually requires math, 
and Congress is substantially a math-free zone.
  So we always start with this chart. Understand, I believe there are 
five pillars, and you can mix them up any way you want to.
  Immigration. How do you design an immigration system in the future 
that maximizes talent importation to the Nation? Because you need to 
maximize economic philosophy as soon as possible. That is what the rest 
of the world has done. Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, and 
Canada have moved to talent-based systems because they figured out that 
there is something elegant about that model.
  Now, let's be honest. I don't care what gender you are. I don't care 
your religion. I don't care your race. I don't care who you cuddle 
with. I don't care about those things. We care about the talent you 
bring to our society to maximize economic growth. I actually think it 
is a much more elegant model than we use today in immigration.
  Economic growth. We must hunker down and embrace tax policy, 
regulatory policy, and trade policy that maximizes economic vitality. 
The velocity of the size of this economy must continue to grow, and 
grow at a fairly substantial rate. If you look at the data, 91 percent 
of the spending increases from this government from 2008 to 2028 are 
functionally three things: interest, Social Security, and healthcare 
entitlements.
  So we are all going to talk about debt. It is a threat to our 
society. When we are going to have the honest conversation, it is 
substantially driven by our demographics and our healthcare costs.
  The next one we are going to talk about is labor force participation. 
We are going to spend time tonight on that. I know it is a dry subject, 
but this is actually trying to be intellectually honest. This is a 
moment where if you are going to call our office and say we want 
solutions, we are working through it. But it is not trite.
  My father used to have a saying. We were just talking about it over 
in the corner. For every complex problem, there is a simple solution 
that is absolutely wrong. It turns out, complex problems require 
complex solutions.
  We are going to talk tonight about labor force participation. How do 
we get as many Americans across the board to participate in the 
economic vitality? It turns out that has an amazing effect; everything 
from our healthcare costs, to tax collections, to just the economic 
growth.
  The next two, there is a technology revolution about to happen in 
healthcare. It is also happening in environment. In the next couple of 
weeks we are going to come here and show some of the amazing 
technologies that are out there that actually make some of the 
environmental discussion seem sort of passe when you understand the 
technology that is on the cusp of rolling out.
  Let's talk about healthcare right now. I have come here to the floor 
over the last couple of weeks and shown things like--we nicknamed it in 
our office the flu kazoo--something a material science professor has 
developed; you blow into it, and it instantly tells you if you have a 
viral infection, and in the backbone, it could automatically order your 
antivirals. Start thinking about the revolution that would happen in 
the cost curve of healthcare if we had substantial change in autonomous 
healthcare.
  In the Phoenix area, we have an organization that now, I believe, has 
seven of these autonomous healthcare clinics where you go in, you sign 
up on an iPad, you take a picture of your insurance card, your driver's 
license, you go in and you put your arm in, you pick this up, you shine 
it in your throat, your ear, and your nose, and the algorithm is able 
to do amazingly accurate calculations of your health.
  Think about that type of technology when it is in your pocket. You 
have all seen the pocket size, the size of your


smartphone that is now an ultrasound. It is completely portable. We 
must, as a body--and this is at our State legislature, but particularly 
this body--we must break down these barriers to the technology 
disruption that could be a revolution in lowering healthcare costs.

  You have got to be intellectually honest. The ACA, the Republican 
alternatives, in much of the discussion, we are not actually having a 
discussion about lowering healthcare costs. We are having discussions 
about who gets to pay.
  It is time that we embrace and truly draw in the technology that can 
be that very disruption. We have a running joke in our office: Did you 
go to Blockbuster Video last weekend? We all live it. It is now time 
that we understand that our future healthcare costs are an Achilles' 
heel to this society because of our demographics and just where the 
costs are going.
  There is another part of that. We are going to actually do a floor 
presentation, probably at the end of the month. There are incredible 
disrupters coming in the pharmaceutical world. We just had some 
information and we think, actually by the end of this year, there may 
be a single shot cure for hemophilia A. That is only about 8,000 of our 
brothers and sisters in the country, and it is going to be really 
expensive, but it cures.
  What happens as we continue to see these biological, genomic 
pharmaceuticals rolling out that actually cure? Or the one that we were 
reading about today, that stabilizes our populations who have ALS?
  What does that mean to the cost curve of the 50 percent of healthcare 
spending that is to the 5 percent of our population that have chronic 
conditions?
  The last one I am going to give you is, it is time to rethink the 
incentives--and this one will always be tough--in Social Security, in 
Medicare. How do we encourage an individual to stay in the labor force? 
Are there things we can do to encourage waiting to take benefits? And 
these are math. It is just actuarial science.
  So today we are going to talk about labor force participation. Isn't 
that exciting? The first slide I have already mentioned, this is from 
the CBO report 3 weeks ago, and I was shocked it didn't get much press 
or discussion in this body because it is math.
  But if you look at this chart, what it is trying to say is, in 
functionally 9 years, half of the spending of this body--if you remove 
interest--half of the spending will be to those 65 and older.
  It is just demographics. We got older as a society. In 9 years it is 
the end of the baby boomers, because they have moved into being 65 and 
older.
  But if you had seen this chart and then matched it up to where you 
start to see the debt and spending curves move up, you understand they 
are in sync: if you care about the debt, if you care about spending, if 
you care about opportunity in our society, understand the demographic 
headwinds and what we must do to face that.
  So one of the reasons for this slide, and I know these are a little 
tough to watch, but what I want you to sort of see is this is 2000. At 
that time, actually over 67 percent of our population was in the labor 
force. It functionally collapsed after 2008 and never returned.
  The blessing is this last year we have had a little bit of a blip. 
There were these really smart economists who said: Hey, you are never 
going to get back up to 62, 63 percent of labor force participation. I 
believe we are now around 61 or 62. We actually need to find a way to 
get back to that 67 percent of our brothers and sisters all up and down 
our society being in the labor force, having the honor, the elegance of 
working.
  There were some amazing numbers last December, if you actually broke 
into what was in those statistics, of the number of organizations, the 
number of companies that were actually reaching out to the handicapped 
community and making accommodations and hiring.
  There are actually--and we are going to touch on this--some parts of 
our society are moving into the labor force, particularly in the 
millennials, and we are seeing parts that are not. Countries like Japan 
that actually have faced this, are facing it, have actually been trying 
to design incentives and programs for even those who are older, who are 
healthy, who are capable, who are desirous to be welcomed to stay or 
enter back into the labor force.
  It is a barbell. We have a problem with part of our younger 
population, and then, obviously, our older population--which we have so 
much talent--that are retiring. We are going to have to have an honest 
incentives discussion design to maintain this labor force philosophy.
  If you actually look at what is going on in our society right now, if 
I had come to you 2 years ago and said: Hey, we are going to see all 
sorts of quartiles in our society have some of the lowest unemployment 
in modern history, I think I would have just gotten blank stares. But 
it is happening. And with that incredible, almost full-employment 
society, we are actually seeing--and particularly in markets like 
Arizona--we are actually now seeing wages really starting to move. This 
is wonderful. This is something we needed, functionally, for a decade 
or two.
  We can do a much more complicated discussion of some of the 
incentives that were built in the tax reform last year that encouraged 
investment in plant and equipment to push up productivity. Productivity 
allows you to be able to pay people more. But those are the sorts of 
things you talk about. How do you maintain economic vitality?
  When we actually look at some of the unemployment numbers, there is 
something missing. Understand, when we look at unemployment numbers, we 
are looking at people who are actively looking, actively searching for 
employment. We actually have a real problem in parts of millennial 
males and others, so how do we reach out and design incentives to stay 
in?
  We are also going to go to some of the other tougher questions, and 
that is: Is it time to rethink things like Social Security disability 
and say, hey, if you earn $24,000, or you hit this point, you hit a 
cliff. Your benefits disappear. If you are on other safety-net 
programs, if you earn a certain amount, you hit a cliff, and it 
disappears.
  We need to have a brutally honest conversation of, is that incentive 
of that cliff an incentive not to enter the labor force? What would 
happen if we would work out the math so it was a much more gradual 
glide slope to draw those individuals into labor participation? Because 
if we are almost a full-employment society but we still had millions 
and millions of Americans who are choosing not to participate in the 
economy and we really need them in our economy, we have got to look to 
what are the disincentives.


  It is about time that we actually start to have those social 
entitlement conversations. I know for both Republicans and Democrats, 
these are tough because it requires math. It requires us to work 
through certain ideological folklore. But if you want the wholistic 
solution to make it through the next 30 years, this labor force 
participation is one of those five pillars.
  The reason I actually did this slide is--this one is a little geeky--
but it is actually trying to walk through what has been happening. I am 
not going to walk through all the detail, but we recently had this 
wonderful pop of sort of in the population of 25 to 34 females entering 
the workforce. That was one of the great things that we actually saw 
last December. Great.
  We need to understand why millennial women are entering the workforce 
in these sorts of numbers, what we learn from that, and what we do now 
for the millions of millennial males who are still dramatically 
underrepresented in the economy.
  Data shows millennial women dominating the current job market. Look 
at this separation right here and why this is so important. Remember 
how I was just saying something has been happening in the last couple 
quarters where millennial females are entering, but millennial males is 
the lower line. This is a conceptual problem, but it is real math.
  Remember we talked about our barbell? We have those who are older. 
How do we create incentives to enter and stay in the labor force? How 
do we reach out to our younger population, get them, incentivize them, 
and work with them to get them into the labor force? Functionally, we 
just do not have a choice.


  Let me grab another slide. We will put these up in our office. 
Remember, this sort of presentation is for those who really care about 
digging in to the actual math of policy. So often, what we end up doing 
on the floor is political theater and folklore.
  If you look at some of these lines--and I know this is a long time 
ago--but if you and I were to step back to 1967 and look at the data 
for males, we had 97 percent of working-age males in the labor force. 
Today, if we did that same thing, I think we are at about 88. It falls, 
87, 88.
  One of the big things that helped us grow the economy is female 
participation in the economy. But we need to find a way to get this 
back up. We are just talking a few points, but those few points of a 
few more million stepping back into the labor market have substantial 
economic impact.
  I want to talk about a story from Arizona. I have had this discussion 
with a couple of my Democratic friends. Within that, we have talked 
about incarceration rates and some of the other things that end up 
becoming impairments for young males to be in the labor force.
  In Arizona right now, we have such a shortage of skilled trades--
electricians and carpenters--that a number of the businesses in 
Arizona--actually, I approached our Governor, Governor Ducey, and said: 
Help us. We are willing to take our own money and go into Arizona 
correctional facilities and do a training program that is, when someone 
is going to be on parole in just a few months, we will train them, and 
we will guarantee that we will hire them. It doesn't mean a guarantee 
that they will keep them.
  So last year, we brought this young man out from Arizona. We brought 
him to the Ways and Means Committee. He sat down in this beautiful 
room. The Ways and Means Committee room, it is just very big and very 
ornate. He didn't look like our typical witness, with a number of 
piercings and a number of tattoos around the neck. He looked up when it 
was his turn to tell his story, and he hesitated for a moment and 
started with: I am a three-time convicted felon.
  He went on to tell his story of how he was an addict and the other 
times he had gotten out of prison, he had relapsed. He had lost his 
family. He had lost everything. He had lost contact with his child.
  He was a few months from his opportunity to go on probation and leave 
the correctional facility, and he saw this flyer that said: We are 
doing training for electricians. We guarantee we will hire you--it 
doesn't mean we are going to keep you--if you pass this very basic 
course.
  He said: Why not?
  He took this electrician course while in prison, while it was paid 
for by private industry because the job market is so tight they are 
willing to take risks on all sorts of populations to get them back into 
the work environment.
  He graduated. He started at just a little over minimum wage. A year 
later, he was making, I think, $23-something an hour. He said he hadn't 
relapsed because he is working too much. He said he is back with his 
family. He gets to see his child. There are these incredibly human 
stories.
  If we are in a society right now that is almost at full employment 
for those looking for employment, how do we reach out to those whom our 
society gave up on or who gave up on themselves? How do we as 
policymakers design those incentives, design the social entitlement 
programs, and design our society where we want everyone to have this 
opportunity within our communities and our society?
  It was one of the most touching and amazing hearings, because when 
you looked at those of us sitting up on the dais, there were actually 
tears hearing his story and realizing there is hope, that this economic 
vitality provides opportunity and hope.
  We turn it into a political football because it is not our side that 
wants to get credit, or their side wants to get credit. We need to get 
beyond that, because if we don't get this math right, my 3-year-old 
little girl won't have the same type of future I have had.
  There is a path to make this work and continue to have an economy, a 
nation, that grows and provides opportunities. Understand, when the 
United States grows, the world benefits.
  But we have those five pillars. Is this body capable of stepping up 
and doing things that are complex without a simple solution?
  Madam Speaker, I so desperately hope so. With that, I yield back the 
balance of my time.

9,VA MEDICAL CENTERS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2105-4,1,Mr. BOST,"  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I have run a small business, and I know that 
any organization needs long-term certainty. No organization can 
successfully operate under a revolving door of short-term leaders, 
especially not one tasked with caring for America's heroes. 
Unfortunately, this is what is happening at our Nation's VA centers.
  Almost 20 VA medical centers, nationwide, currently lack a permanent 
director. Some of these facilities have not been staffed by a permanent 
director in almost 2 years. Instead, these facilities are managed by 
short-term directors who stay on the job for just a few months.
  There is just not a lot you can do in a few months. It is not nearly 
long enough to review operations, recommend improvements, and see these 
reforms brought through to an end. That is why I introduced bipartisan 
legislation with Mr. Costa from California that put an end to this 
revolving door. Our bill pushes the VA to hire permanent directors at 
all VA medical centers--no more interim directors.
  We all want a VA system that can complete its mission to care for 
those who shall have borne the battle. Having consistent leadership is 
the least we can do for our Nation's heroes.

  This week, the House Democrats will bring a bill to the floor that 
will restrict your freedoms and do little to reduce gun violence.
  As a father and a grandfather, I want to reduce gun violence as much 
as anyone, but we have to be smart. We can't get roped into scoring 
political points. That is why I worked with my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle last year on a measure which is now law to increase 
security for our kids in the schools. But the gun control bill being 
considered this week makes it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend 
themselves and others against criminals who have guns.
  We need to enforce the laws already on the books, not limit the 
rights of law-abiding citizens who want to protect their families.

11,RECOGNIZING OAKWOOD POLICE CHIEF RANDALL MOON'S SERVICE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE211-3,0,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia,"  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Randall Moon, who is retiring this week after serving as Oakwood City 
Police Chief for the past 25 years.
  Mr. Moon started with the Oakwood Police Department in 1990 and was 
quickly promoted to Chief in June of 1994. Over the past 29 years, Mr. 
Moon has witnessed the police force grow from seven officers to sixteen 
officers and has been key in assisting the department as they have 
worked to grow the department with an ever-changing city. Through it 
all, he is most proud of ``maintaining an excellent workplace, with 
excellent pay and benefits.''
  Mr. Moon credits a presentation on bike safety, given to his second-
grade class by two Georgia State Patrol troopers, as the catalyst for 
his desire to work in law enforcement. Ever since, Mr. Moon knew law 
enforcement was his calling, and he has since served in law enforcement 
for over 34 years, including 29 years in Oakwood.
  He leaves his successor with a few words of wisdom: be a friend, be a 
family, as that's what sets Oakwood apart from other police 
departments.
  The citizens of Northeast Georgia are fortunate to have men like Mr. 
Moon serving our communities. I thank Mr. Moon for his exemplary 
service, and I wish him all the best in his retirement.

is anyone that Michael Cohen hasn't lied to. We already know he lied to 
Congress. We already know he lied to law enforcement, lied to the IRS, 
lied to three banks, and he is going to prison for his lies. So I guess 
it will be relevant for us to determine: Does he lie to his own family? 
Does he lie to his financiers? Does he lie to his financiers who are 
members of his family?
  It will be one heck of an inquiry for us because this is someone who 
has tangled such a web of lies that he is not to be believed. I think 
it is entirely appropriate for any Member of this body to challenge the 
truthfulness, veracity, and character of people who have a history of 
lying and have a future that undoubtedly contains nothing but lies. 
That is the story of Michael Cohen.
  We will see it play out tomorrow, and I for one can't wait to get to 
the bottom of things and can't wait to get to the truth.

                   Declaration of National Emergency
",,2019-02-26
25,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,6,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today, the House of Representatives 
will take up a motion to terminate the state of emergency proclaimed by 
President Trump. For many reasons, the measure should pass with 
bipartisan support.
  First, Members of both parties know there is no actual emergency at 
the border. Nearly 60 former national security advisers--Democrat and 
Republican, bipartisan--including former Secretaries of State and 
Defense, have written a statement saying there is ``no factual evidence 
of an emergency at the border.'' The President himself said, when 
announcing the state of emergency, that he ``didn't need to do this.''
  An emergency, by definition, is something you need to do. It is an 
emergency. In the President's own words, this is not a state of 
emergency.
  If we let Presidents, whomever they be--Democrat or Republican--
willy-nilly, because they want to get something done, just declare an 
emergency when it is clear it has been a long-term


condition, a long-term issue, this country is a different country.
  That leads to my second point. Members of both parties should be 
concerned about the President diverting money away from military 
construction projects in their districts.
  Again, the President doesn't like you for some reason. He says there 
is an emergency and takes money away from a project in your State that 
you have worked hard for. That is no way to govern.
  But at the top of the list is this: the Founding Fathers looking down 
upon this Chamber and upon these United States of America. They set up 
an exquisite balance of power. They were worried about an overreaching 
Executive. They knew what King George was all about. So they named the 
Congress, the House and Senate, the article I--article I, not II, III 
or IV--part of the government. Second, they gave the Congress one of 
the greatest powers any government has, which is the power of the 
purse.
  When the President tries to take these powers away, which clearly he 
is doing in this case--he called for an emergency when he couldn't get 
his way in Congress, not because some new facts came on the scene--it 
is a change in the fundamental, necessary, and, often, exquisite 
balance of power.
  I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle understand 
that. In fact, true conservatism worries about too much power being 
centralized in any place because conservatism exalts the freedom of the 
individual.
  So to look the other way because Donald Trump wants this--because he 
is almost sometimes in a temper tantrum about this issue--is so short-
sighted and is so detrimental to the long-term health, stability, and 
viability, even, of how the balance of power works.
  So I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to contemplate 
what it might portend for our democracy to allow this emergency 
declaration to stand. What would stop any future President from 
claiming an emergency every week and doing what they wanted--a total 
subversion of the balance of powers, a derogation of huge power to the 
Executive, which has plenty of power already?
  The National Emergencies Act has been used only once in its 
relatively short history, and that was to take action after 9/11--
clearly, an emergency. Now President Trump is trying to bend the law to 
his will, not to address a military emergency, not to address any real 
emergency. This has been an ongoing issue. He would say ``problem.'' 
That is OK, but he is doing it for personal political gain, to 
accomplish something Congress rejected and the American people oppose.
  He has tried several times to get this wall. Congress has resisted. 
Congress even resisted when Democrats didn't have control of the House, 
and now they do. Elections do matter. We are a democracy, President 
Trump. So it is hard to imagine a more senseless and destructive use of 
emergency powers than what the President has proposed.
  So let us, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, rise to the 
occasion. This will be a moment in history, a point where things may 
turn a bit. If Congress stands up, it will be a reaffirmation of our 
democracy. It will be a reaffirmation of the democracy the Founding 
Fathers wanted. If Congress stands up--Democrats and Republicans--when 
the Founding Fathers look down on this Chamber after the vote occurs, 
they will smile because this is the democracy they wanted. They did not 
want a democracy where a President could simply declare an emergency on 
a whim and overrule what Congress has done.
  So let us--Congress--first the House and then the Senate, speak up 
with one bipartisan voice to remedy this injury that President Trump is 
trying to do to our constitutional order.
  Whatever you think of the best way to secure our border, this is not 
the way for a President--any President--to exercise his authority. This 
is not about whether you are for or against a wall, and I, of course, 
am against it. It is about what America is all about, whatever your 
view on the wall.


                                  Guns

  Madam President, on guns, the House this week will take up a measure 
to close the dangerous loopholes in the background check system used to 
certify firearms. For years, Democrats have tried to address these 
loopholes--the gun show, online, and private sales loopholes--only to 
be met with lockstep resistance by a Republican Congress beholden to 
the NRA. It is 90 percent of Americans who favor strengthening the 
background check system, not 51, not 52, 90--the majority of 
Republicans, the majority of gun owners. Any way you slice it, 
Americans are strengthening background checks. Americans believe 
felons, spousal abusers, or those adjudicated mentally ill should not 
have guns, but Congress is paralyzed because of the other side's 
obeisance to the NRA--not even after Newtown, not even after 
Charleston, not even after Las Vegas, not even after Orlando, not after 
Parkland.
  On guns, the tide is turning. Make no mistake about it, a strong 
majority of the American people support these policies now. The NRA has 
been considerably weakened. They did not do very well in the last 
elections. Finally, there is a House in Congress that will listen to 
the American people and take action on guns--thoughtful, moderate 
action on background checks.
  With each measure that passes the House, the pressure will build on 
the Senate to take up these reasonable, commonsense gun safety 
measures, and I hope my colleagues will join us.


                                Buybacks

  On another matter, buybacks. This morning, the New York Times 
reported on an interesting facet of the recent stock market rally. Many 
investors, according to the Times, are selling off stock. Average 
investors are selling off stock. Pensions, and mutual funds, 
nonprofits, endowments, private equity firms, and trusts are all, in 
the aggregate, selling stock.
  So then why is it rallying? The laws of supply and demand should say 
the stock market should go down. The Times reports that it is corporate 
self-investment buybacks. Companies are buying back their own stock at 
such a rapid clip that they are propping up the market and, to a great 
degree, themselves. It is another clear example of how the recent 
explosion of stock buybacks in corporate America is distorting the 
market--artificially, some would argue.
  Some Democratic Senators, and even some Republican Senators, have 
begun to sound the alarm about the recordbreaking scale of corporate 
buybacks. Over the last decade, based on analysis of America's largest 
corporations, 466 of S&P 500 companies, 92 cents out of every dollar of 
corporate profit has gone to share buybacks or dividends.
  Some say, well, they have already, before the profits, put money into 
their workers and into their communities. We are saying they should put 
some more, for the good of the country. Stock price, when so much of it 
is held up by buybacks, shouldn't be the only indicia, the only 
measure, of how well the country is doing, especially when 85 percent 
of the stocks are owned by the top 10 percent of Americans.
  Most Americans would completely agree that there are more productive 
ways for corporations to allocate their capital than this borderline 
obsession with stock buybacks--the slavery to short-term rises in price 
to please investors--while not doing much for workers or for 
communities.
  I hope corporate America will wake up. Income inequality, along with 
climate change, to me, are the two greatest problems America faces. We 
need corporate America to propose some solutions because when they say 
let government do it, much of corporate America then opposes government 
doing anything for workers or for communities.
  Let's take a careful look at this, and let's see what the right 
solutions are. The status quo is not acceptable.


                             Climate Change

  Madam President, on climate change, for decades we have known climate 
change is not only a major national challenge but an existential threat 
to our planet and to our future. Despite the gravity and scale of this 
challenge, one political party in the United States has largely denied 
the problem even exists, denied the overwhelming consensus of the 
scientific community, and denied most attempts in Congress to tackle 
climate change.
  President Trump's record on climate change is one of abject failure: 
denying science, systematically rolling back environmental protections 
that reduce


carbon emissions, and announcing withdrawal from the Paris climate 
accords--Luddite, ostrich-like, if there ever were, actions that can be 
described that way.
  Recently, we heard of a new effort by the Trump administration to 
once again push back against efforts to address climate change. You 
see, it was probably embarrassing for President Trump when his own 
administration released the National Climate Assessment last year, as 
required by law, which outlined the severe and immediate impacts of 
climate change. According to reports, the White House now has plans to 
set up a fake panel of cherry-picked scientists who question the 
severity of climate change in order to counter the scientific consensus 
on this terribly urgent problem, even within the administration. This 
new fake panel will reportedly be set up under the National Security 
Council, not the EPA, not NOAA, or any of the Agencies where real 
scientists work--real climate scientists.
  This is maybe the most conspicuous symptom of the disease of climate 
denialism that has infected the Republican Party and the hard right. 
This is beyond willful ignorance. This is the intentional, deliberate 
sowing of disinformation about climate science by our own government. 
This cannot stand.
  This morning, I am announcing that if the Trump administration moves 
forward with this fake climate panel, we will be introducing 
legislation to defund it. I will be doing it, along with several of my 
colleagues. It is long past time for President Trump and Republican 
leaders to admit that climate change is real, that human activity 
contributes to it, and Congress must take action to counter it.
  So far, Leader McConnell and our Republicans, when we ask them, do 
you believe climate change is real? Silence. Do you believe humans 
cause it? Silence. Do you believe Congress has to act to deal with it? 
Silence. That will not stand, and they will not be able to maintain 
that position over a period of time.


                              North Korea

  Madam President, finally, on North Korea--and I appreciate the 
indulgence of my friend from Illinois. There are a lot of topics and a 
lot of things going on today.
  As the President continues negotiations in Hanoi with the North 
Koreans, I want to restate that his goal should be complete, 
verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of Korea. An agreement 
that includes significant U.S. sanctions relief in exchange for 
something short of that will be woefully insufficient. It will make 
North Korea stronger and the world more dangerous, not safer.
  To simply say to North Korea that we are going to let you continue to 
be nuclear in exchange for something else--a peace treaty or some 
words, a photo op--that is not protecting the security of the United 
States.
  I remind my colleagues, Congress passed sanctions against the North 
Korean regime for its appalling record on human rights. Congress would 
need to repeal that law for President Trump to give North Korea 
reliable sanctions relief.
  The North Koreans themselves should realize many of us in Congress 
will not, will not, will not--no matter what President Trump does, many 
of us in Congress will not remove this sanction relief until North 
Korea denuclearizes, verifiably and irreversibly.
  Make no mistake about it, no matter what President Trump does in 
Vietnam this week, this Chamber will have a significant role to play if 
President Trump decides to reduce sanctions as part of any deal with 
North Korea.

27,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,8,Mr. THUNE,"  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last night, for the second time in a 
month, Democrats objected to a bill to ban infanticide.
  That statement to me is absolutely chilling, but for the second time 
in a month, Democrats objected to a bill that would do nothing more 
than state that a living, breathing baby born in an abortion clinic is 
entitled to the same protection and medical care as a living, breathing 
baby born in a hospital is entitled to.
  It is a pretty basic bill. It just says that living, breathing, born 
human beings are entitled to protection even if they are born in an 
abortion clinic, but apparently that is not something Democrats are 
prepared to say. This is where Democrats' support for abortions has led 
them--to being unable to condemn infanticide.
  Let's remember why we voted on this bill last night. We voted on this 
bill because the Democratic Governor of Virginia implicitly endorsed 
infanticide--because the Democratic Governor of Virginia got up and 
said that you could keep a living, breathing baby comfortable while you 
decided what to do with it.
  There is only one answer to what you do with a living, breathing 
baby, and that is to provide it with the care it needs. A baby born 
alive in an abortion clinic is no less valuable and deserving of 
protection than a baby born in a delivery room.
  It is horrifying that we are actually having a debate about this. 
Honestly, it is horrifying that the Democratic Party can't get up and 
say that infanticide is wrong. My Democratic colleagues like to talk 
about protecting the vulnerable, but how can they claim to care about 
helping those in need if they harden their hearts toward the most 
vulnerable among us? If they are willing to deny living, breathing 
babies basic medical care, do you really stand for the vulnerable if 
you can't stand up and say that infanticide is wrong?
  It is terrible enough that we have so far betrayed our founding 
principles as to deny the right to life of living, breathing unborn 
babies, but we are not even talking about abortion here. We are talking 
about withholding essential care from babies who are born alive. My 
Democratic colleagues can't even bring themselves to say this is wrong.
  I would say to my Democratic colleagues, do you really want to be the 
party of Governor Northam? Do you really want to be the party of 
infanticide?
  The American people don't agree with the Democratic Party on abortion 
and on infanticide. Most Americans believe that babies born alive after 
an abortion should be provided with medical care. Most Americans think 
there should be at least some limits on abortion. In fact, most 
countries in the world think there should be some limits on abortion. 
The United States is just one of a tiny handful of countries that allow 
elective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. Among the others on that 
list are China and North Korea--not exactly the company we want to be 
keeping when it comes to protecting human rights.
  A recent poll found that 71 percent of Americans oppose abortion 
after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Yet the Democratic Party is aggressively 
embracing an agenda of zero restrictions on abortion, ever, up to--and 
now, apparently, after--the moment of birth.
  I hope last night is not the last time we vote on the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I hope my Democratic colleagues have 
a chance to recast their votes. I hope, next time, they will decide to 
vote against infanticide. I hope, next time, they can affirm what 
should be a basic, foundational principle, and that is that every baby, 
wherever he or she is born, deserves to be protected.

29,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,10,Mr. DURBIN,"  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I listened to the statements of my 
colleague from South Dakota. I would like to make a suggestion.
  Since the Republicans are in control of the U.S. Senate, since there 
is a Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would 
suggest to my colleague that perhaps we have a hearing on this bill he 
just described. You see, it came to the floor yesterday without any 
hearing. And the reason why we need a hearing is that many of us--many 
of us--voted for an infanticide law, which is currently on the books--a 
law that says that a child needs to be protected and that those who 
don't protect that child are subject to criminal penalties, as they 
should be.

  Now, if this is a different approach to it, doesn't it at least merit 
a hearing from the Republican majority before it comes to the floor for 
a vote? There are many questions I would like to ask of those who 
propose this. I want to understand why the law that has been on


the books now for 17 years, as I remember, is inadequate to the 
challenges it faces.
  I supported the infanticide law. I will continue to. If there are any 
changes that the Republicans want to make, is it too much to ask them 
to have a hearing in their own committee, which they chair, on this 
subject matter? I hope they will take it seriously enough to do it. 
Critics have said this has nothing to do with changing the law. It is 
just a ``gotcha'' vote on the floor--an amendment which may be used 
against candidates in future elections.
  When it comes to children, something as serious as life and death 
should be taken much more seriously by the Republican majority.


                  Aurora, Illinois, Warehouse Shooting

  Madam President, today is February 26. Eleven days ago, on Friday, 
February 15, an angry man with a history of violence and a Smith & 
Wesson .40 caliber pistol opened fire on his coworkers and police 
officers at a warehouse in Aurora, IL, about 40 miles from the city of 
Chicago.
  In a matter of just a few minutes, five of this man's coworkers at 
the Henry Pratt Company were dead. He then shot and wounded five police 
officers who rushed to the scene. An hour and a half later, he died in 
an exchange of gunfire with other policemen.
  The day before this horrible incident marked the anniversary of two 
other mass shootings: the 1-year anniversary of the Parkland, FL, 
shooting, which killed 17 high school students and staff, and the 11-
year anniversary of a shooting at Northern Illinois University that 
left 5 students dead and 17 injured.
  The gunman in the Henry Pratt warehouse massacre had just been told 
that day that he was going to be fired. His response was not just 
anger. His response was to pull out a firearm and murder five of his 
coworkers.
  I want you to meet the victims of this man's violence. This is Trevor 
Wehner. Trevor was 21 years old. He was on the dean's list of Northern 
Illinois University's business college. He was on track to graduate 
this May.
  Why was he at the Henry Pratt warehouse on that day? It was because 
he was on his first day of an internship at the business. Trevor was so 
excited about this opportunity to work at this business and to see what 
it was like to actually be in the real world that he showed up for his 
internship 45 minutes early that day. It was earlier than he should 
have. He was that excited. He died at the workplace that day.
  This is Clayton Parks. He was known as ``Clay'' to his family and 
friends. He was the human resources manager at Henry Pratt. He was also 
an alumnus of Northern Illinois University. He had been working at the 
Henry Pratt Company for 4 months. He was 32 years old. He was married 
to his wife Abby and had a beautiful little 9-month-old baby boy, Axel.
  I met them at Northern Illinois University when we held a vigil for 
Trevor and Clay that afternoon. I talked to Clay's mom for the longest 
time. She wanted to tell me his whole life story, hoping that she could 
preserve the memory of this wonderful young man and what he meant to 
her.
  Russell Beyer is over here. I went to his memorial service. He had 
been at Henry Pratt for more than 25 years. He was a mold operator and 
was the father of two grown children. He was also the chairman of the 
union at Henry Pratt.
  In a terrible twist of fate, Russell had helped the gunman get his 
job back when the company first fired him 2 months earlier. Last 
Thursday would have been Russell's 48th birthday. Instead of a birthday 
party, his family and friends gathered that day at his wake. As I went 
into the funeral home in Montgomery, IL, I was struck by this fact. It 
turns out that the family decided that since Russell was such a 
passionate football fan, everybody should wear NFL jerseys. The room 
was filled with members of his family remembering him and paying 
tribute to him by wearing jerseys of all of the different teams they 
supported. Russell was a Patriots fan. He wore a Patriots jersey in his 
casket on the day that would have been his 48th birthday.
  Vicente Juarez was a stockroom attendant and a forklift operator. He 
had been at Henry Pratt for 13 years, since the year 2006. Mr. Juarez 
and his wife of 38 years lived in a home in Oswego with their three 
grown children and eight grandchildren--all under one roof.
  I will not forget that scene at the funeral home, either, because the 
family had decided that everyone would wear a T-shirt. It was a black 
T-shirt with a color photograph of Vicente in front of it and one of 
his favorite sayings on the back of it. There they were--grandchildren, 
children, older folks--all wearing those black T-shirts in honor and 
memory of this man.

  I met his sister. His sister told me a story that Vicente was part of 
the family who immigrated to Illinois in 1972. There were five boys and 
five girls. They didn't have any money. Their father died 6 years after 
they immigrated. Yet they struggled and worked and stuck together as a 
family. That beautiful family--that beautiful family--had to shoulder 
this tragedy, where this gunman walked into that warehouse and killed 
Vicente.
  Josh Pinkard's photograph is here. He was the plant manager. He 
joined Henry Pratt's parent company 13 years ago at a facility in his 
native Alabama. He and his wife had moved to Illinois with their three 
little kids last spring. As he lay dying, Josh pulled out his cell 
phone and texted his wife. His message was this: ``I love you. I've 
been shot at work.'' He died shortly thereafter. Josh Pinkard was 37 
years old.
  How did the police respond to this mass shooting? Every on-duty 
member of the Aurora Police Department rushed to the scene, where they 
were joined quickly by off-duty members of the police department. Then, 
once the word got out that a policeman had been injured, hundreds of 
other policemen, firefighters, and other first responders all came to 
the scene.
  I was on the phone with the Aurora police chief, Kristen Ziman. 
Kristen put out a statement, which I commended her for. It was the most 
eloquent statement. It said many things, but I want to repeat what it 
said. She said: ``Every time an officer was hit, another one went in. 
No one retreated.''
  All told, five members of the Aurora Police Department were injured 
by gunfire: Officer Adam Miller, Officer Marco Gomez, Officer John 
Cebulski, Officer James Zegar, and Officer Reynaldo Rivera. A sixth 
officer, Diego Avila, suffered a knee injury. They and hundreds of 
other police officers and first responders who rushed to the scene are 
heroes. Simply put, they are heroes. Their quick and courageous 
response certainly saved other lives.
  Here is the cruel irony and tragedy beyond the loss of life. The 
gunman should never have had a begun. In 1995, this gunman pleaded 
guilty in the State of Mississippi to charges that he had beaten a 
former girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbed her with a knife. He 
was sentenced to 5 years in prison. He served 3.
  In January of 2014--19 years later--he applied for an Illinois 
firearm owner's identification card. He lied on that application. He 
said he had no felony record, and he was given permission under 
Illinois law to buy a firearm. He got away with that lie because the 
State of Mississippi had failed to submit his conviction record to the 
FBI's criminal background check system. He wasn't in the computer as 
being disqualified.
  In March 2014, this man bought a handgun from a gun dealer in Aurora. 
Two weeks later, he applied for a concealed carry permit. This time he 
slipped up. He voluntarily submitted his fingerprints in the hopes that 
his concealed carry permit would be expedited. Those fingerprints 
finally exposed his felony record in Mississippi and his violent past.
  The Illinois State Police got word of it, rejected his concealed 
carry application, revoked his firearm owner's identification card, and 
sent him a letter saying that he needed to surrender the Smith & Wesson 
firearm, which he used to kill these five innocent people and to injure 
these policemen. Obviously, he never surrendered the weapon. It was 
that same weapon that he used to kill these innocent people and to 
injure these policemen.
  Almost 7 years ago, a disturbed young man opened fire in a movie 
theater in a suburb of Denver, killing 12 people and injuring 70 
others. The name of that suburb was Aurora--Aurora, CO.
  In a sad commentary on how frequent mass shootings have become in 
this great Nation, the police chief of


Aurora, CO, tweeted after the killings in Aurora, IL: ``Months from 
now, as people talk about the mass shooting in Aurora, someone will 
ask, ``Which Aurora mass shooting are you talking about?''
  Mass shootings have become too common in America. They make the news, 
but tens of thousands of Americans die every year from gun violence, 
and many of those deaths are barely reported or noted. They die in 
suicides and gun accidents, alone or in small groups, in domestic 
disturbances, in gang disputes, and in crossfire.
  I am honored to represent the city of Chicago, but my heart breaks to 
know that last year more than 2,700 people were injured or killed by 
gun violence in that great city.
  Let's face it, America is confronting an epidemic of gun violence. We 
need thoughts and prayers, but we need so much more. We need action to 
do something.
  Do the lives of these policemen mean anything? Of course, they do. 
They mean a great deal to their families, and they mean a great deal to 
this Nation.
  Do the lives of these victims who died mean anything? I met the 
families--four of them. They are heartbroken, and their lives will 
never be the same.
  We need action to close the deadly gaps in America's gun background 
check system. Much of the work needs to take place at the State level. 
State and local law enforcement agencies are investigating how this 
tragedy might have been prevented and how to prevent another violent 
felon from slipping through the cracks in the system.
  We also have a responsibility here. It is not enough for a moment of 
silence. It is not enough for prayers to be offered. We need to do more 
to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.
  This week, the House of Representatives will vote on a measure to 
close the gun show and internet loopholes in our background check 
system. These loopholes make a mockery of the law, which says we want 
to make sure that no dangerous person buys a firearm or keeps a firearm 
in America. It is critically important, and I support the House's 
effort, but, sadly, I have to predict that this measure will not even 
come up for a debate--let alone a vote--in this Republican-controlled 
Senate. There is just no way that they will consider any gun safety 
measure.
  After Columbine and nearly every mass shooting and natural disaster 
since, a carpenter who lives in Illinois has crafted wooden memorials 
to honor the fallen.
  His name is Greg Zanis, 68 years old. In 20 years, he has made and 
delivered--listen to this--more than 26,274 handmade wooden crosses, 
Stars of David, and crescent moons to communities across this country.
  Greg drove to Sandy Hook, CT, after 26 first graders and educators 
were murdered in their grade school. He drove to Las Vegas after 58 
people were killed at a music festival. He drove to the First Baptist 
Church in Sutherland Springs, TX, after 26 worshipers were killed. He 
drove to Pittsburgh, PA, to honor the 11 worshipers killed at the Tree 
of Life synagogue.
  Even after all that tragedy, the mass murder at Henry Pratt hit Greg 
Zanis especially hard. You see, Greg Zanis's hometown is Aurora, IL. 
Mr. Zanis told a reporter from the New York Times that he could drive 
away from all of the other tragedies, but he said: ``I am not going to 
be able to get away from this one.''
  To those who will say that the aftermath of a mass shooting is not 
the time to talk about gun safety, I have one simple question: When is 
the right time to talk about gun safety? If we are going to talk about 
it only on the days when no one dies in America because of the use of 
guns, then, of course, we will never talk about it.
  Will you wait until this killing comes to your community, your 
church, your kid's school? Is that what it will take before Members of 
the Senate and the people across this Nation feel as Greg Zanis does, 
that you just can't escape this carnage anymore? I pray that is not the 
case.
  We need to work together. Let's start. Let's do something sensible 
and bipartisan in the name of gun safety to make our background check 
systems as effective as they can be.
  Look at those faces. Eleven days ago, they were alive, part of a 
family, loved--sons, fathers, grandfathers--and now they are gone 
because one man who never should have owned a gun took it to work in a 
fit of anger and killed these five men. It is time for this Senate and 
this Congress to do something.

                   Declaration of National Emergency
",,2019-02-26
37,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,18,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, President Trump declared a national 
emergency 2 weeks ago. He did this in order to build a pet project of 
his. In the process, he said it was his intent to siphon billions of 
dollars that Congress had appropriated to help our men and women in 
uniform. Now, I am not sure what lawyers he consulted, but those 
lawyers seem to have overlooked our Nation's founding document--the 
U.S. Constitution.
  I know the President likes to communicate in 280 characters or less, 
so I will point him to a 77-character phrase he may want to review: 
``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of 
Appropriations made by Law.''
  That is a short sentence, but our Founders knew what it meant. They 
enshrined it in article I, section 9 of the Constitution, and they 
established that Congress--and Congress alone--possesses the power of 
the purse. That Congress has exclusive power over our government's 
spending priorities is one of the most critical checks and balances in 
our constitutional system. The President can propose funding for 
whatever project he wants. He has the absolute right to propose 
funding, but it is the job of Congress to decide where to invest the 
American people's hard-earned tax dollars.
  Let's review the facts. For over 2 years, the President has 
repeatedly tried and has repeatedly failed to convince Congress that 
building his southern border wall is a good idea. He has failed to get 
a deal with Mexico despite giving his word and promising his supporters 
more than 200 times that Mexico would pay for it. He promised that 
Mexico would pay for it while knowing, of course, that Mexico would not 
pay a cent for it. Then he failed to get a deal with his own party even 
during the 2 years when the Republicans controlled the Presidency, the 
U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. He also failed to 
get a deal after he forced the country into a 35-day government 
shutdown over the issue--a shutdown, incidentally, that cost our 
country at least $11 billion, to say nothing of the number of people 
whose lives were so disrupted that many either lost their apartments, 
were unable to pay their mortgages, were unable to pay their bills, or 
were unable to pay for the medical care they needed.
  Yet, in the face of all of these failings, he has decided to go it 
alone. He has decided to stretch his powers--beyond all recognition--
under the National Emergencies Act. There is no rational basis to 
justify the use of this authority. So we should look at what a 
bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats wrote--a group of 58 
former senior national security officials who had to help secure our 
country under both Republican and Democratic Presidents.
  They wrote: ``There is no factual basis for the declaration of a 
national emergency'' on the southwest border.
  I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Declaration of Former United 
States Government Officials be printed in the Record.",L000174,2019-02-26
38,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,19,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reality, of course, is that 
apprehensions at the southwest border have dropped 75 percent since 
2000. The reality is that many of the southern border communities have 
violent crime rates that are lower than our national average. The 
reality is that the vast majority of the drugs that are apprehended at 
the border are seized at the ports of entry, and a wall would do 
nothing to stop this. The President is either out of touch with 
reality, willfully ignoring it, or not even reading the material he 
gets from his administration.
  Presidents do have emergency powers, but they should be invoked only 
in true times of crises. It is an abuse of power to invoke these 
authorities simply as a political step to energize a President's base. 
It is an abuse of power to invoke these authorities to fulfill a 
cynical campaign promise he never should have made. The President knew 
he would never keep his word or the promise he had made that Mexico 
would pay for this border wall.
  When Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to convey 
these powers to the President, it assumed whoever sat in the Oval 
Office would have enough respect for the office and the power being 
conveyed not to abuse it. President Trump has failed that test. Since 
1976, Presidents of the United States--Republicans and Democrats 
alike--have upheld and passed the test. President Trump has failed the 
test. Look what he wants to do. The President wants to raid money that 
is meant for military housing and military base improvements to pay for 
his wall. This is at a time when studies are coming out that show how 
our men and women in the military are being housed in inferior or 
dangerous conditions. Sometimes the buildings have mold and decay, and 
it affects their health. The buildings are rat invested and roach 
infested, but the President wants to take the money away from them to 
build a wall that we do not need. The President has repeatedly decried 
the amount of drugs coming across our border. But now he wants to raid 
money that Congress has appropriated for proven drug programs and 
counter-drug programs to pay for his wall.

  Let me repeat that. In order to build a wall that would do very 
little to stop drugs from coming across our border, President Trump 
wants to take money away from law enforcement programs that actually 
prevent drugs from coming across our border or from programs that 
enhance military readiness. I wish I were making this up. It sounds 
like something you hear on a comedy program, but it is not comedy, it 
is reality, and I have to ask, what is going on?
  In the days and weeks ahead, the President's emergency declaration--
which amounts to an end run around both the Constitution and Congress--
is going to be challenged, and it should be. Over the past 2 years, we 
have seen the erosion of our institutional checks and balances in the 
face of creeping authoritarianism. The time has come for Congress and 
members of the President's own party to take a stand. Are we a 
democracy, or are we an authoritarian government? It is a pretty basic 
question.
  I have been here with every President since President Gerald Ford. 
They upheld the Constitution, Republicans and Democrats, and they 
believed in the separation of power. All of them did. We simply cannot 
afford to now remain silent in the face of such an unprecedented 
violation of the separation of powers.
  It is interesting. As I sit here, I remember some of my Republican 
friends--and they are my friends--when President Obama was President. 
They shouted from every rooftop about the lurches of an imperial 
Presidency. In every Executive order, they saw a threat to Congress's 
power. In every speech, they surmised the machinations of a lawless 
strong man--a man Donald Trump claimed wasn't born in the United 
States. Now, when they are faced with a President who is literally 
using his Executive powers to fund what Congress specifically would 
not, my Republican friends should echo the same concerns.
  I am glad that some in the Republican Party have begun expressing 
their reservations about President Trump's national emergency 
declaration. Certainly a number of Republicans who serve in national 
security positions who signed on to the material


I have put in the Record did. But fleeting comments to reporters in the 
hallway are meaningless unless they are willing to follow up their 
words with their votes.
  Today, the House will vote to disapprove the President's declaration. 
I believe that joint resolution of disapproval will pass the House. In 
short order, the Senate will have to vote on it. That is going to be 
the true test. That will be the metric history uses to determine 
whether Republicans are willing to put our country, our Constitution, 
and Congress itself over party.
  While the President's emergency declaration stumbles its way through 
the courts, I hope my Republican friends take a moment to take stock of 
where we are. President Trump will be just a blip in our Nation's 
history. But for the sake of appeasing a man who hundreds of times made 
a foolish campaign promise, never grounded in reality, will they 
forever change the course of the separation of powers in our country? 
For the sake of appeasing a President who detests any limits or checks 
on his authority, will they forever diminish the role of Congress as a 
coequal branch of government? We are the longest surviving democracy on 
Earth today because there are checks and balances.
  I am reminded of words of caution written by George Washington, our 
Founding Father and our Nation's first President, in his Farewell 
Address. The words are as true today, and we read this Farewell Address 
every year on the floor of the Senate. Here is what President 
Washington wrote over 223 years ago:

       It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a 
     free Country should inspire caution in those entrusted with 
     its administration, to confine themselves within their 
     respective Constitutional spheres; avoiding in the exercise 
     of the Powers of one department to encroach upon another. The 
     spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all 
     the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form 
     of government, a real despotism. . . . If in the opinion of 
     the People, the distribution or modification of the 
     Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be 
     corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution 
     designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for 
     though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, 
     it is the customary weapon by which free governments are 
     destroyed.

  That is what George Washington said. He warned us against despots. 
Remember, this was a man who could have remained President for life, 
and he voluntarily stepped down after a second term. He was a man who 
did that because he wanted democracy to thrive.
  He spoke of the three coequal branches of government--the executive, 
the legislative, and the judiciary--and he was reminding us that if you 
let one encroach upon the other, you start down the path of despotism. 
We don't need that in this country, especially in this age. We don't.
  We know what despots are like. We see them around the world. We see 
them in South America today, in one country in particular. We see them 
in North Korea, where the despot had his uncle executed, his own 
brother murdered, and thousands of people are imprisoned, starved, and 
dying. A despot who continues to build nuclear weapons to keep himself 
in power even as his people die of starvation. In a democracy, that 
doesn't happen. We have checks and balances for a reason.
  I am going to vote aye on this joint resolution of disapproval. I 
urge all Senators to do the same. Have checks and balances.
  I remind the President to treat emergency declarations the same way 
they have been treated since 1976, the way--certainly in my 
experience--Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, both Bushes, Clinton, and 
Obama did. That preserved democracy. Was it frustrating to each of them 
at times? Of course it was. I remember long discussions with President 
Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President George H. W. Bush, 
President George W. Bush, President Clinton, and President Obama. They 
would say: We want to do this. A number of us had to say: You don't 
have the authority to do that. And they realized that.
  It is not the person who holds the office. It is not the Presiding 
Officer. It is not me. It is not the other 98 Members of this body. It 
is not the President of the United States. It is not the Members of the 
House. It is not the members of the courts. What rules this country is 
our Constitution. We are a democracy. We must keep it as a democracy. 
Look what happens in those countries where they ignore democracy and 
have despots. In Venezuela, people are going without food and medicine. 
In the Philippines, where there is a despot, there have been murders of 
people who are just under suspicion, encouraged by him. We have seen 
the deaths of thousands of people in North Korea because of a despot 
who does not care and has no sense of morality.
  America is so much better. Follow our Constitution. Obey our 
Constitution. Realize there are checks and balances. Have both 
Republicans and Democrats stand up and join. Remember what George 
Washington said. It was good advice back then; it is good advice today.

42,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,23,Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina,"  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent 
from yesterday evening's vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 
311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. On vote No. 27, 
had I been present, I would have been a yea vote on the motion to 
invoke cloture.
  Let me say that a little differently. As I sat, waiting for my plane 
to leave Charleston, SC, to come to the Nation's Capital--a trip that 
typically takes about 63 minutes--3 hours later, I had not yet arrived 
in Washington, DC.
  On a vote that, to me, should not be a vote at all--this should be 
common sense, but it certainly was not common sense, so we had to have 
a vote on an issue that is very near and dear to my heart.
  I will say without any question that the frustration I felt at being 
late to that vote was one that was incredibly irritating and 
infuriating. I had planned to be on the floor of the Senate voting yes 
on a commonsense piece of legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act, but was unable to make it because a 1-hour 
flight took more than 3 hours, and I arrived here about 4 minutes after 
the close of the vote, which also is quite frustrating.
  But what is even more frustrating than that is that in a nation of 
good conscience, we would be debating and having a conversation about a 
child who is born, sitting there, alive, separated from her mother, 
that there would be a question of whether that child should be able to 
continue to live.
  This is an issue that has been raised by people coming out of New 
York and more recently by people coming out of Virginia and by the 
Governor--who happens to be, from my understanding, a pediatric 
surgeon--who suggested it is OK to allow that child to die.
  Whether you are pro-life, as I am, or pro-choice, as others, I cannot 
imagine that this would even be an issue of debate or discussion 
between the two sides. There is no side on this topic. There cannot be 
a side about life separated from the mother and whether that life 
should continue to live. This is common sense. This is human decency. 
This is not an issue of being pro-life or pro-choice. This is being 
pro-child, which we all should be.
  So I find myself at a loss for words, standing on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate--where a vote yesterday failed by several votes--having to 
discuss what doesn't make sense.
  I have recently spoken to a group in Charleston, SC, during Black 
History Month, where the GOP and African Americans were in the same 
room having a great conversation about the issues that are important to 
our Nation. We talked about so many of the powerful issues of economic 
opportunity and opportunity zones. There may have been some 
disagreement on whether we should have higher taxes or lower taxes, but 
there was no disagreement on the issue of infanticide. There was no 
disagreement whatsoever. In the room, whether you were to the left


or to the right, there was one thing that was common, and that was the 
value of life.
  I traveled to Little Rock, AR, this weekend to speak at another Black 
History Month event, where Republicans and Democrats were coming 
together at the Governor's Mansion to have a conversation about moving 
this Nation forward and about reconciliation. In the room, we had 
conversations about the tragedies in Virginia, from the blackface 
tragedy to the issues with the three ranking members in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. When I started talking about the value of 
human life, the intrinsic value of each human being, there was 100 
percent support that we are a nation that should always value the life 
of a born-alive child. There was not a single dissent in a room of 
nearly 400 people.
  To have to have a debate on the floor of the Senate about something 
that every American with whom I have spoken, in airports or at events, 
agrees there is nothing to debate, frustrates me. So while I am 
saddened and frustrated, I have been encouraged by my fellow 
Americans--from Arkansas to South Carolina, to Tennessee--who have all 
come to the same conclusion, and that is that a born-alive child 
deserves to live.
  We may disagree on other points, but this is a place where there is 
universal agreement with the folks I have spoken to. These are folks 
who don't vote for Republicans or Democrats; they all vote for 
children. They all vote for life.
  We are a nation that must continue to value life. For some reason, 
somehow, this body missed that opportunity to reinforce that value 
system before the American public, to say to each child born: No matter 
your State, no matter your challenges, you have intrinsic value.

                      Nomination of Eric D. Miller

44,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1448-3,25,Ms. CANTWELL,"  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to a nomination we 
are going to be vote on very soon--the confirmation of Eric Miller to 
serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
  As a U.S. Senator, I take my obligation to advise and consent on 
judicial nominations very seriously, and I believe Mr. Miller's 
confirmation process has gone against longstanding Senate tradition and 
norms and limited our role to advise and consent on his nomination.
  This nomination has proceeded over the objection of both myself and 
my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray. For more than 100 years, 
conferring with Senators and allowing them to advise and consent on 
judicial nominees in their home State has been our process.
  Since 1936, only eight judges have been confirmed when one home State 
Senator objected. In every case, confirmed nominees have been supported 
by at least one Senator from the nominee's State, and to this day no 
circuit court judge has ever been confirmed despite opposition from 
their home State Senators. All that would change if Mr. Miller is 
confirmed.
  His confirmation hearing was held during a recess last Congress, when 
the vast majority of Senators were back in their States. In fact, only 
two Members of the U.S. Senate were present at the hearing, and neither 
one of them were Democrats. Mr. Miller was questioned for less than 5 
minutes--5 minutes--and when the Judiciary Committee Democrats 
requested another hearing, that request was rejected.
  Confirming Mr. Miller without a full vetting by both Democrats and 
Republicans is the wrong way to proceed on a lifetime appointment. 
Moreover, confirming Mr. Miller without approval from Senator Murray 
and I would set a damaging precedent.
  I do have concerns about Eric Miller's record. He has spent much of 
his career fighting against the interests of Tribal governments and 
Tribal sovereignty. He has argued cases opposing Tribal fishing rights, 
challenging Tribal sovereignty, and fighting against the protection of 
Native American religious and traditional practices, so it is no 
surprise that organizations representing all 573 Tribal nations around 
the United States, including the National Congress of American Indians, 
oppose Mr. Miller's confirmation.
  I urge my colleagues to stop this process and oppose Mr. Miller's 
confirmation to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

50,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,1,Mr. CORNYN,"  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yesterday evening the Senate had an 
opportunity to go on record and show our constituents that we supported 
the most vulnerable among us. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act would require doctors to treat a baby, once it is born, 
with ordinary medical assistance, something they would do under any 
other circumstances, even though this entailed surviving an abortion.
  If you ask the American people, they would say this is just common 
sense. In a recent poll, more than three-fourths of Americans said they 
support providing medical treatment for babies who survive abortions. I 
can't imagine what the other 25 percent are thinking. But there are no 
Federal laws requiring healthcare providers to care for these babies 
just as they would any other infant in their care, and for some Members 
of the opposing party, they are just fine with that.
  We all know that a few weeks ago, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam 
made disturbing comments about how to not care for certain newborns. He 
was asked: What would you do with a child with birth defects?
  He said: Well, the infant would be delivered. The infant would be 
kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated, if that is what the 
mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue 
between the physicians and the mother.
  Let me be clear. The Governor, who is a pediatrician, by the way, 
essentially advocated for infanticide--killing a child who was born 
alive. Instead of saying, ``well, it is my duty as a physician under 
the Hippocratic Oath to provide care to save the child,'' he believes 
the child ought to be made comfortable, and then the mother and doctor 
sit down and decide whether the child should live or die.
  That is not healthcare. That is murder. I believe the Senate has a 
duty to act and ensure that no child born alive is subjected to the 
treatment described by Governor Northam.
  The bill we voted on last night would protect newborns who have 
survived abortions and ensure that they receive the same level of care 
that any other newborn baby would. It builds upon a previous law, which 
the Senate passed unanimously, called the Born-Alive Infant Protection 
Act. That bill passed unanimously in 2002, and it clarified that every 
infant born alive at any stage of development is a person, regardless 
of the manner in which they were born. Yet yesterday, 44 Senators voted 
to allow that same person's life to be ended with impunity.
  The legislation we voted on yesterday would simply clarify that the 
infants who survive abortions are entitled to the same lifesaving care 
that other babies should receive. That is why it is so shocking to me 
that 44 of our colleagues chose to vote against even proceeding to a 
debate and a vote on the matter.
  I am trying to think of a historical counterpart to this. I was 
reminded of a book I read not long ago called ``Eichmann in 
Jerusalem.'' This is about the trial of Adolf Eichmann after the 
atrocities of the holocaust, during which 5 million Jews were killed. 
The author, Hannah Arendt, was trying to figure out what kind of 
monster could basically provide for the machinery that ultimately would 
take the lives of 5 million Jews.
  What she saw when she looked at Eichmann was not some monster that 
looked different from you or me. Unfortunately, what she saw was 
somebody who looked exactly like you and me. She wrote about the moral 
collapse associated with the holocaust. She noted that ``in the Third 
Reich, evil lost its distinctive characteristic by which most people 
had, until then, recognized it.'' She said that the problem is that at 
that point it became a ``civil norm.''
  She wrote:

       Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought, for 
     as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and 
     examine the premises and principles from which it originates, 
     it is frustrated because it finds nothing there.

  ``That,'' she said, ``is the banality of evil.''
  She concluded by saying:

       Nearly everybody who attended the trials of mass killers 
     after the war, some of them respected doctors and 
     pharmacists, came away with the disconcerting impression that 
     the killers looked pretty much like you and me.

  So while Republicans and Democrats disagree on a range of issues, 
this should not be one of them. If we have one shred of our humanity 
left, we ought to agree that protecting human life is essential. This 
should have been a simple vote for every single Member of this body. I 
can't tell you how disappointed I am that 44 of our colleagues decided 
to vote no. I was proud to vote yes on the bill, yes to protecting 
these newborn babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and 
yes to life.


                        Prescription Drug Prices

  Madam President, this morning, the Senate Finance Committee held the 
second in a series of hearings on prescription drug pricing. We all 
know that across the country, the rising costs of prescription drugs is 
placing a strain on families.
  A survey last summer found that many Texans are struggling to afford 
the rising cost of healthcare, and three out of five people surveyed 
reported foregoing or postponing care because of the cost. That 
includes cutting pills in half, skipping or rationing doses, or not 
filling a prescription because they simply can't afford to do so. Some, 
though, are taking even more drastic steps.
  Last year, a widow in Austin considered selling her house to pay for 
the expensive drugs she needed to treat hepatitis C, which had killed 
her husband years earlier. Many Texas families have begun the dangerous 
practice of buying their drugs in Mexico--even though they may be 
counterfeit--because they think they are more affordable than filling a 
prescription in the United States.
  With healthcare costs continuing to press more and more of our hard-
working families, things aren't expected to get any easier any time 
soon. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that 
between 2018 and 2027, consumers could expect to see prescription drug 
spending increase by an average of 6.1 percent a year. That is a


faster increase than hospital stays, doctors' visits, or any other cost 
in the healthcare sector.
  This spending doesn't just have an impact on patients. It accounts 
for a large portion of our national economy. In 2017, the national 
health expenditures totaled $3.5 trillion. That is 18 percent of our 
gross domestic product. Prescription drugs account for 10 percent of 
our total health expenditures, more than $330 billion. They have an 
impact on our entire country.
  The Senate Finance Committee is digging into the reason behind those 
rising costs. The journey a drug takes from research and development to 
the manufacturing plant, to pharmacy shelves, and to our medicine 
cabinet is enormously complicated. I wonder whether it is complicated 
by design. Once a consumer has purchased a drug, figuring out who gets 
each dollar spent practically requires the forensic skills of a 
Sherlock Holmes.
  What I find particularly concerning, and something we spoke about at 
length today, are the rebates and other discounts provided by 
manufacturers. Pricing from one pharmacy to another can be wildly 
inconsistent, and rebates are often the root of the problem. In another 
context, what is now called a rebate might be called a kickback. 
Rebates are the key to determining if a particular drug is covered by 
your insurance, and that can impact therapies that you have access to. 
Despite the impact they have, the terms of rebates are mostly cloaked 
in secrecy. I don't think that is an accident. If you ask pharmacy 
benefit managers and plans about rebates, they will argue that overall 
they are a good thing and can help lower insurance premiums across the 
board. The issue, though, is that the extra money has to come from 
somewhere. So list prices are often raised to cover the difference. 
When that happens, the consumers are the ones who take the hit. For 
everything you pay within your deductible--and many deductibles in this 
post-Affordable Care Act era are up in the thousands of dollars--you 
pay 100 percent of the retail cost. You get zero benefit from the 
rebate. As the list price goes up, your out-of-pocket costs go up. That 
is why the stories of families struggling to cover costs are becoming 
more and more prevalent.
  Some of the people who suffer the most from the rebate system are 
people who take insulin. Diabetes is one of the most common and 
pernicious illnesses in our healthcare system in America today. Because 
we eat too well and exercise too little, many people develop diabetes, 
and the only treatment is to take insulin. Unlike most of the 
prescription drugs out there, insulin is a biologic, meaning it is 
generally more expensive to make and more expensive to buy.
  A few weeks ago, I spoke here on the Senate floor about a woman from 
Indiana who came to the first hearing we had on prescription drug 
costs, Kathy Sego. She told us about her family's struggle to pay for 
her adult son's insulin. Even though this drug has been around for 
nearly a century, a 1-month supply for Kathy's son Hunter costs her 
family $1,700 out of pocket.
  Unlike many brand-name prescription drugs that have lower-cost 
alternatives, like a generic, insulin does not. Part of our discussion 
at today's hearing was the topic of ``biosimilars,'' or what could be 
considered a generic version of a biologic type of drug. As the FDA is 
moving to make insulin subject to biologic competition in the future, I 
asked our witnesses about this move and how it could potentially serve 
as a solution for families like Kathy's, who struggle with the out-of-
pocket costs and copays as a result of the insulin with which they 
treat their diabetes.
  As part of that effort, last week, Chairman Grassley and Ranking 
Member Wyden launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices. 
In letters to leading insulin manufacturers, they requested information 
on the recent price increases--some as high as 585 percent.
  As I expressed today to one of the representatives from the drug 
company, I understand the need for drug companies to do research and 
development and that because they are granted patents for these 
innovative cures that they come up with, they have the exclusive right 
to sell those drugs during the terms of the patents. Yet I don't 
understand why a drug that has been around for decades, like insulin, 
still costs $1,700 for somebody to pay each month on an out-of-pocket 
basis, and where we have seen recent price increases as high as 585 
percent, it makes absolutely zero sense to me. I am eager to hear from 
these manufacturers and other players in the pharmaceutical system 
about why these prices are rising so rapidly and how we, in working 
together, can provide relief to families who bear the brunt of 
manufacturers' decisions.
  I conclude by saying that I also had an interesting conversation with 
one of the witnesses from the drug companies, the manufacturer of 
HUMIRA. HUMIRA is one of the best-selling drugs in the world for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other things. The company that 
makes HUMIRA earns $18 billion a year in revenue from the sale of 
HUMIRA. When I asked why it was necessary for the company to have more 
than 100 different patents to cover that drug when the drug is 
essentially the same molecule, the gentleman representing the drug 
company did not give me a satisfactory answer.
  I can understand the importance of recouping those R&D costs and the 
benefits of providing a patent for a reasonable period of time to 
recoup those costs and make a profit. I am OK with that. Yet, when you 
see the patent system being manipulated in a way that maintains that 
exclusive right to sell that best-selling drug by a drug company, that 
causes me grave concern. I have talked to Chairman Graham of the 
Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over patent-related issues, 
and he told me he would work with me to find a solution to gaming the 
patent system in order to protect that exclusive right to sell a drug 
beyond the normal patent period because it is, ultimately, the 
consumers who are being cheated and being denied access to the lower 
cost drugs.
  As with insulin, there is no good reason why, after all of these 
years, consumers have to see price increases approaching 585 percent. 
We need answers to those questions, and we will get answers to those 
questions.
  I yield the floor.

                      Nomination of Eric D. Miller
",,2019-02-26
54,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,5,Mr. DURBIN,"  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the pending 
nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals in a seat based out of the State of Washington.
  If the Senate chooses to confirm Mr. Miller, it will be a historic 
decision because it will be the first time ever since the introduction 
of blue slips over 100 years ago that the Senate has confirmed a 
nominee who is not supported by either of the home State Senators from 
the State in which he will be seated.
  What is a blue slip? It is basically a consultation with the Senate 
before we move forward on a nomination. It is a courtesy that has been 
extended. It is an effort to try to find some common ground, some 
understanding, perhaps some moderation when it comes to the choice of 
nominees. It has been abused in some cases, but the two Senators here--
Senator Cantwell and Senator Murray--are well known in this body for 
being reasonable people who try to find solutions to problems and work 
well with both sides of the aisle. Yet, in this case, the Trump White 
House has decided that they are going to push this nominee for the 
Ninth Circuit in their home State of Washington against their wishes. 
If Mr. Miller is confirmed, we will have taken away yet another 
guardrail in the Senate advice and consent process.
  If you follow what has happened in the Senate over the last 2 years 
and a few months, you know that the highest single priority of Senator 
McConnell's--the Republican leader--is to fill the Federal judgeships, 
to put in place men and women who will serve literally for a lifetime, 
as long as they live. He is determined to do it. There is a template 
for the people who they find acceptable. If you have been a law


clerk for Clarence Thomas, you check the box, you are ready to go--a 
lifetime appointment. If the Federalist Society decides you are the 
right person for the Supreme Court of the United States, box checked, 
off we go.
  Instead of relying on common sense, moderation, and judgment, we are 
going through a formula here to put people on the bench for a 
lifetime--those who have been approved on the Republican side of the 
aisle. Make no mistake--under Democratic Presidents, we look to 
nominees who are closer to our value system, for sure, but we never 
walked away from the blue slip process until this nominee--the first 
time ever it has been done.
  We have seen so many things change under the Republican leadership in 
the Senate when it comes to the selection of judges.
  We used to say that if you are found unqualified--not qualified--by 
the American Bar Association, forget it. Go about your business. Do 
something else. We are not going to put you on the bench for life. 
Well, we have decided, under the Republican leadership, that is no 
longer the case. Simply being unqualified is not enough to disqualify 
you.
  We have also said that when it comes to the process of making these 
decisions, we will have hearings where we will consider multiple 
candidates in the same day. Let's run them through. Of course, you know 
what happens when you do that: You get in a hurry, and you end up 
putting people on the bench for life who shouldn't be there.
  We have also decided in this White House that we will send people off 
to be Federal judges who have never been in a courtroom in their 
lives--not once. Maybe they watched ``Perry Mason'' on some retro 
channel, but that is about as good as it ever was for some of them.
  I recall one of the nominees from the Trump White House. It was a 
moment in the history of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator John 
Kennedy of Louisiana asked him some basic questions about what it meant 
to be a judge and some of the things he would have to rule on. It was a 
sad moment. It reminded me of my worst days in law school when I didn't 
know the answers to the test or to the question being asked by the 
professor. This nominee, thankfully, withdrew. He never should have 
been nominated.
  In this case, when it comes to Mr. Miller, neither of the Washington 
Senators returned a blue slip on him, and they have a reason. He is 43 
years old; he may serve on the bench for three decades or more. In his 
relatively short legal career, he has demonstrated that his views are 
far outside the legal mainstream, particularly when it comes to one 
legal issue--the issue involving Indian Tribes.
  I don't know if you watched the Oscars, but I did, and I was watching 
for a movie that I saw that I was impressed with. It was called 
``Roma.'' It was a movie about Mexico. It received quite a few awards, 
and I thought it deserved them. It raised some painful questions for 
people living in Mexico. I know because I have spoken to Mexican 
Parliamentarians at a dinner a few weeks ago. It is the treatment of 
indigenous people.
  Most countries in the world, including the United States, haven't 
written a very admirable record when it comes to the treatment of 
people who were here before we ``arrived.'' What we have done to Native 
Americans in this country, sadly, is nothing to brag about. They were 
dispossessed, relocated for their lands, and many times treated in the 
poorest possible fashion. The movie ``Roma'' was about indigenous 
people of Mexico who are servants, and some would say slaves, to 
families who have more money in Mexico. So the question of the 
treatment of Native Americans is not something that we can just push 
back in the pages of history; it still confronts us in the United 
States today, as it does in other countries, like Mexico and Australia 
and so many others.
  So what does this have to do with this nominee? It turns out that in 
a rare moment, the National Congress of American Indians weighed in 
against Eric Miller for this circuit court nomination. The National 
Congress of American Indians opposed his nomination. Here is what they 
wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, and I want to quote it in 
its substance:

       Our concern is that he chose to build a law practice on 
     mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands, 
     religious freedom, and the core attribute of federal 
     recognition of tribal existence. His advocacy has focused on 
     undermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme 
     positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal 
     rights. Indeed, his law firm website touts his record, with 
     over half of his private practice achievements coming at the 
     expense of tribal governments. Given his strong preference 
     for clients who oppose tribes, there are considerable 
     questions about whether he would be fair in hearing cases 
     regarding tribal rights.

  You might say to yourself: Well, that has to be a narrow area of the 
law--Tribal rights--and if he happens to consistently get that wrong, 
how important could it be?
  Take a look at the fact that he has aspired to be a nominee to the 
circuit court--the second highest court in the land--in the Ninth 
Circuit. The Ninth Circuit includes 427 of the 573 federally recognized 
Tribal nations of America. That circuit he aspires to for a lifetime 
appointment hears more cases involving Tribal issues than any other 
Federal circuit. It is deeply troubling to see a Ninth Circuit nominee 
whose impartiality on Tribal legal matters is in question.
  Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by not only the National Congress 
of American Indians; he is also opposed by a broad array of civil 
rights, environmental, labor, and other organizations that are 
concerned about his record and legal views. He is 43 years old--43 
years old--three more decades to hand down decisions.
  It is astonishing that the Senate would vote to confirm a nominee 
this controversial over the objection of home State Senators and to 
break a century-old tradition in the Senate to do it. These Senators 
represent millions of people in the State of Washington. Their good 
judgment has been recognized by election and reelection. But when it 
comes to having a voice in the selection of a circuit court nominee who 
will be serving their State for the next three decades, they have been 
shunned and pushed aside.
  I think the Republican majority is making a mistake. They are so 
bound and determined to fill these vacancies that they are abandoning 
basic Senate traditions--which, in fact, will slow things down from 
time to time, I am ready to admit, but also put at least a note of 
caution into a critical judgment process.
  Blue slips encourage consensus and cooperation between the Senate and 
the White House. There isn't a single one of us serving in the Senate 
who hasn't counted on that cooperation to make sure that lifetime 
appointments to the Federal judiciary are people who can stand the test 
of time. Although they may not agree with any Senator every single 
time, they bring judgment, experience, balance, and moderation to their 
service. Blue slips ensure that the voices of the American people, 
through their Senators, are heard in this process, and they help steer 
the nomination process toward the middle of the road. Without blue 
slips, the White House can ignore home State interests and pick extreme 
judges who do not have the confidence of that State's legal community.
  This decision--for the first time in a century--to abandon blue slips 
for the sake of putting this man in a lifetime position on the circuit 
bench could affect every one of our States someday. I can't understand 
why my Republican colleagues want to diminish their authority, their 
ability to safeguard against judges who should not be appointed for 
life. That is what we are doing on the vote to confirm Eric Miller to 
the Ninth Circuit.
  I will oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same, if 
for no other reason, so that when the time comes--if it ever comes--
that you ask for the respect of this body when it comes to the 
selection of an important Federal judge, you will receive it regardless 
of who the President may be.

         183rd Anniversary of Texas's Independence From Mexico
",,2019-02-26
57,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,8,Mr. CRUZ,"  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, this Saturday, March 2, the great State of


Texas celebrates the 183rd anniversary of its independence from Mexico.
  Texas became a free republic--for 9 years our own nation--and soon 
after became one of these United States.
  As is tradition, in commemoration of the brave Texans who fought and 
died for liberty and the rule of law, let us reflect a moment on the 
immortal words of Colonel William Travis, the leader of the besieged 
forces at the Alamo. His clarion call for reinforcements resounded 
around Texas and still rings with strength today.
  Indeed, it has a special place in my heart because the very first 
time I spoke on this Senate floor, I read from Travis's letter from the 
Alamo. It was during Senator Rand Paul's extended filibuster in defense 
of individual liberty. It fit then, and it fits now. It is a letter 
that has stood for the ages--written to us today, demanding that we 
stand with all good and free people against oppression and reminding us 
that there are some things worth dying for.
  The letter reads as follows:

       Commandancy of the Alamo,
       Bexar, February 24th, 1836
       To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World:
       Fellow citizens & compatriots--I am besieged, by a thousand 
     or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have sustained a 
     continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not 
     lost a man.
       The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, 
     otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the 
     fort is taken--I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, 
     & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never 
     surrender or retreat.
       Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & 
     everything dear to the American character, to come to our 
     aid, with all dispatch--The enemy is receiving reinforcements 
     daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in 
     four or five days.
       If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain 
     myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never 
     forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country--
     Victory or Death.
       William Barret Travis
       Lieutenant Colonel Commandant
       P.S. The Lord is on our side--When the enemy appeared in 
     sight we had not three bushels of corn--We have since found 
     in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels & got into the walls 20 
     or 30 head of Beeves.

I kind of wonder why we even show up to the Senate any longer. This job 
is not what it used to be.
  When I get the chance to read about the history of the Senate, I read 
about these things called debates that we used to have on the floor of 
the Senate. I read about something called an amendment, which 
apparently is a way that an individual Senator calls up a proposal or 
an initiative and puts it on the floor for an up-or-down vote.
  Those things don't really happen anymore in the U.S. Senate. We don't 
have open-ended debates on the big policies of the day.
  I get it. When Republicans control the Senate, they control the 
agenda. When Democrats control the Senate, they control the agenda. At 
the very least, I would have hoped that the Senate majority, now in 
Republican hands, would put their policy initiatives before the Senate 
so we could have an open debate. That doesn't happen any longer. All we 
seem to be doing these days is voting on judges.
  Now, that is a really important function of the U.S. Senate, and I am 
glad we are doing it, but today we are going to do something truly 
exceptional, which causes me, once again, to wonder what my job here is 
and to feel a little bit of sadness as to how it has changed and how 
much less substantive the input of each individual Senator is in the 
direction of this country.
  Today, for the first time in the history of blue slips, we are going 
to vote and, I assume, confirm a judge who didn't get one blue slip 
from either of the home State Senators from which that judge comes from 
and is going to serve.
  This has never happened before. Yet today we will vote on Eric 
Miller's nomination to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit from Washington. 
He is 43 years old, so he is going to be there for an awfully long 
time.
  Eric Miller did not get a blue slip from either of Washington's 
Senators. Let me say that again. That has never happened before in the 
Senate. In fact, the last time a judge was confirmed without both blue 
slips was in 1989. That was the last time before this Congress that any 
judge was confirmed without both blue slips.
  In that instance, it was a Democratic chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee who was confirming a judge over the objection of another 
Democrat. This is very different. These are two Democratic Senators 
from Washington, neither of them returning a blue slip on Eric Miller. 
Yet the majority has decided to go ahead and proceed with this 
confirmation.
  This is a serious break with precedent. The last time Democrats 
controlled the U.S. Senate, Chairman Leahy was the head of the 
Judiciary Committee, and he did not hold a single hearing on an Obama 
nominee who did not have two blue slips--didn't hold a single hearing 
even when there were exceptional circumstances. There was one time when 
Senators initially returned the blue slips but later rescinded them. 
Those are two Republican Senators who submitted them, rescinded them--
did not go forward with the nominee.
  There was another circumstance in which Senators had recommended a 
nominee for the district court but then refused to submit blue slips 
when that judge was elevated to the appellate court. Once again, 
Senator Leahy honored that precedent.
  Now Republicans have already taken advantage of Senator Leahy's 
decision to uphold precedent. I will just give you a couple of 
examples.
  In the Seventh Circuit, Michael Brennan was confirmed for a seat that 
had been held open by Republicans since 2010. So, had Chairman Leahy 
decided to move forward without blue slips, that Seventh Circuit seat 
could have been filled, but because he upheld tradition, it was left 
open, filled by Republicans.
  Similarly, for a district seat in South Carolina, Marvin Quattlebaum 
was confirmed to a seat that had been held open by Republicans, again, 
since 2013.
  So Republicans have already taken advantage of the fact that 
Democrats upheld the blue-slip precedent, but now they are taking it a 
step further.
  In the past, when Republicans have changed the rules here, as they 
did on the number of votes required to elevate a judge to the Supreme 
Court, they claimed it was because Democrats started it. I don't agree 
with that rationale. If you found the change for district court nominee 
so objectionable, I am not sure why you would decide to go further, but 
there is no excuse of that kind here. This is just a brash power grab 
because there is no claim that Democrats, when they were in the 
majority, violated the blue-slip principle. This is a fresh violation 
of tradition here in the Senate.
  There is a reason we give deference to home State Senators. In these 
States and in these districts, there are particular issues that are 
important to their constituents that may be unique to their area in 
which they have more knowledge than the rest of us do. Some of the 
reasons Senators Murray and Cantwell are so concerned about this 
nominee are his extremist views on the issue of Tribal sovereignty, 
which is a very big deal in the State of Washington, and the idea that 
they are going to have somebody sitting in the Ninth Circuit who has 
these extreme views on limiting the rights of Tribes is of great 
concern to their constituents. That is why, traditionally, we have 
allowed for individual Senators to have that kind of voice and that 
kind of say. No longer.
  I would just hope that my Republican friends understand how this 
works. Once the rule is gone, once the tradition is gone--listen, I am 
a relatively junior Senator here, so I don't want to speak for those 
who are going to be the chairman and ranking members of committees in 
the future, but I would imagine it is not coming back. I would 
imagine--once we get through today and Republicans have decided that 
individual Senators, unless they happen to be a member of the majority 
party,


no longer have any say in who is appointed to their circuit courts--
that horse has fully run out of the barn and across the field.
  I don't know if that is a good thing for this body because it is just 
another hit. It is just another assault on the traditions of this place 
in which we used to try to work things out together, in which we used 
to honor the role that individual Senators have some say over what 
happens in their own States and their own regions.
  I do sometimes wonder why we all keep on showing up here if we don't 
really debate legislation as we used to, if we don't get to offer 
amendments anymore, and if we don't have any say any longer in the 
judges who are appointed in our States and our districts, and this is 
just another day that makes me question that as well.

63,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,14,Mr. COONS,"  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to offer brief remarks on 
the nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit.
  I have concerns about Mr. Miller's controversial record--some of his 
ideas and his jurisprudence--which I have spoken to on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, which informed my vote against him on the 
committee.
  But today, I want to speak about my reservations about this body's 
moving forward with his confirmation, given that neither of his home 
State Senators have returned a blue slip.
  Let me briefly talk about what a blue slip is and why it matters. It 
is not in the Constitution. It was not something imagined by the 
Founders. It was something developed by the Members of this body to put 
one further bumper on the power of the President to nominate Federal 
judges and then for the Senate to carry out its constitutional advice 
and consent role. For a long time, it worked fine, and I actually had a 
terrific experience with the blue-slip process. Don McGahn, as the 
White House Counsel, and my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and I, when we 
had a vacancy--two vacancies, actually, in the Federal district court 
in Delaware--went to our local bar and asked for them to put together a 
committee to interview potential candidates.
  We went to the White House Counsel and spoke about the importance of 
the Delaware district court and the process we were following, and, in 
the end, out of a very wide pool of initial candidates and the folks 
who were interviewed by a broad and nonpartisan selection committee of 
our local bar, we advanced three names to the White House. The White 
House picked two, and they were ultimately nominated, and Senator 
Carper and I both returned the blue slips on them. They proceeded. They 
were both confirmed. They are now seated as district court judges.
  That is the way this ought to work. Why does it matter? It matters 
because our States are different. We are the United States, and each of 
our States has slightly different cultures, traditions, and 
communities. The point of having a Senate made up of 100 
representatives of our 50 States is for each of us to come here and 
carry forward some of the values and traditions of our States.
  I am a member of the Delaware bar. It is a bar with a great and proud 
tradition. It is a bar with a somewhat different culture--a much more 
collegial culture, I would argue, than many States around us, and it 
was important to me to be able to advocate to the President, to the 
White House, for the nomination of folks who would represent the best 
of our bench and bar.
  Look, the President and I are in different parties. I understand that 
we will have different policy positions, but in order to get the 
absolute best and brightest of the American bar and to have them 
reflect the values and priorities of the State Senators are elected 
from, the blue slip was developed.
  We have had a difficult and divisive and partisan period here in the 
Senate for as long as I have been here. I don't think it is because I 
am here, but it has been as long as I have been here--since 2010. We 
have had a number of regrettable changes in the policies and the 
practices and the culture of this place, but proceeding with a 
confirmation vote of a nominee who was not supported by either home 
State Senator for a circuit court position is unprecedented.
  I think, before we proceed, this body should stop and reflect on what 
this means for our future. In a district as small as Delaware, it is 
likely the Senators actually know the nominees. In a circuit as large 
as the Ninth, which is the largest, geographically, in our whole 
country, it is almost a certainty that the Senators will not know the 
judges nominated by the President to represent their circuit.
  The blue slip has long been a procedural barrier to the President's 
nominating people who did not reflect the bench and bar of the States 
from which they are drawn. The leader is pushing this forward, even 
over several other nominees pending on this floor.
  One other piece of the process that brought us to today to a vote on 
Eric Miller's nomination for the Ninth Circuit that is worth commenting 
on is that the confirmation hearing on the Judiciary Committee was held 
while we were not in session. No Democrat was present to question this 
nominee. The questions that were raised and the comments that were made 
were only in writing and for the Record, and my understanding is, this 
questioning is very brief--just 5 minutes before just a handful of 
Republican Senators, I think two.
  This young man is going to be given a lifetime appointment to one of 
the most important judicial posts in our country. Frankly, my own kids 
have to work longer and harder and answer more questions to get a good 
grade in high school than this gentleman did in terms of the 
confirmation process of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am very 
worried about the precedent this sets, about what it says--which is 
that we continue to push past norms and traditions in this body--and 
about where we are headed.
  It is my hope that some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee 
will work with me in the months ahead to recognize that there is a 
long, now-bitter path of he said, she said, who shot John, who acted 
first, which has resulted in changes to the whole nomination process.
  I think we can yet pull back to a place where those who are nominated 
are the best and brightest of our country, where, in the process, there 
are protections for the minority and the majority, and where we can all 
end up voting proudly for those who are nominated to serve on the 
Federal bench of the United States.
  I increasingly hear commentators on cable talking about judges as if 
you can know how they will vote based on the President who nominated 
them. So-and-so is described as a Bush judge or a Reagan judge or a 
Clinton judge or an Obama judge, a Trump judge or a Bush judge, as if 
that tells you everything you need to know about a judge. It should 
not.
  In my State, it doesn't, and it is my hope that we can yet pull 
ourselves back from the brink of one more step to a place where our 
judges are seen not as the black-robed individuals dispensing 
independent justice but as folks wearing blue and red jerseys advancing 
a partisan political agenda. That way lies disaster for our 
constitutional Republic.
  Both parties have taken steps that have led us here. Both parties 
need to take steps that will heal this, and I intend to vote against 
the nomination of Mr. Miller because of my concerns about these 
procedural changes that I think are so destructive.

                   Declaration of National Emergency
",,2019-02-26
67,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,18,Mr. TILLIS,"  Mr. TILLIS. Well, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I took a position 
that I think some people consider to be unpopular--particularly some of 
my friends back in my State--that I thought I would come back and 
explain. It has to do with the President's Executive action. It also 
has to do with communicating an important and somber subject.
  There is a crisis at the border. I have been there. I didn't read 
about it. I didn't watch it on TV. I didn't read a tweet about it. I 
invested time down


there, hours and hours with border security. I was on shallow draft 
boats. I was on horseback. I have been on ATVs. I spent a lot of time 
down at the border, and the one thing I will tell you is that the 
President is absolutely right. There is a crisis on the border--and not 
only on the southern border, but I will state that ranchers on the 
northern border also believe they have challenges that this President 
is right to address.
  I also happen to agree with a good portion of how the President is 
going to do it after Congress failed to do its job. Keep in mind that 
over the last year, we have had on this floor Democrats and Republicans 
voting for as much as $25 billion for border security--Democrats and 
Republicans--and now we are fighting over a fraction of that.
  The President needs to act. He got an appropriation of about $1.5 
billion through the negotiated settlement a couple of weeks ago, and 
now he is taking the only action he can until Congress acts, and that 
is to figure out other sources of funding that he believes he can use 
within current statutory limits. The way he has done that is he has 
first taken the $1.3 billion that Congress did appropriate. He has 
another $2.5 billion and another $600 million that I believe he is 
right to reprogram, send to the southern border, and probably make some 
investment in the northern border.
  Here is where I have a respectful difference of opinion with the 
President and the administration: It is the emergency order, that under 
the emergency powers act, he is using his authority to appropriate the 
remaining funds.
  First off, those funds will come what we call the MILCON budget. That 
is military construction. Right now, we are trying to find out what 
that means--which projects we think are critical to help the readiness 
of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines; which investments that we 
were going to make, that we have already determined we should make in 
military construction, are going to be put on hold while we reprogram 
those dollars to go to the southern border.
  The real problem I have is that this is only a fraction of what we 
all know we need to secure the border.
  I want to go back to the humanitarian crisis, though. My wife and I 
had an interesting discussion the other night. She wasn't too happy 
when I took this position originally. I am still not sure if she is 
happy.
  But to understand why I respectfully disagree with the President, you 
have to understand, again, as I started this discussion, that there is 
a crisis. There are people dying. There are millions of doses of poison 
coming across the border every single year that are killing tens of 
thousands of people. That is a crisis. There are thousands of people 
crossing the border and dying. They have what they call coyotes, human 
traffickers who will get them across the border, get people who will 
pay thousands of dollars to cross the border, and then they will say: 
Civilization is just an hour away.
  It is an hour plane ride away. Most people don't understand the sheer 
size and scale of Texas, particularly those crossing the border in the 
dead of night, working with basically organized crime. You have to pay 
a toll to get through the so-called plazas that run the northern border 
of Mexico.
  My problem right now has to do with an Executive order, the emergency 
declaration that the President intends to send to Congress.
  My wife and I were having a discussion. She said: You just said you 
agree with the President that there is a crisis on the border; you 
agree with the President that we need to send resources down to the 
southern border and work on the northern border; you agree that 
Congress has failed to act; and you agree that if you were President, 
you would do exactly what he is doing.
  I said yes.
  She said: Why don't you support it?
  I said: Because I am not the President. I am a Member of the U.S. 
Senate. I am a Member of a coequal branch who actually believes that 
this action falls within our purview. Now we are going to find out 
because I am sure we are going to be challenged in the courts. But I 
also worry not so much about this one--frankly, even the way this money 
is going to be programmed, I agree with. What I worry about are future 
Presidents and what they may do if we set this precedent going into the 
future.
  We actually have a Democratic candidate running for President--this 
is one hypothetical. There have been some far-flung ones that I am not 
sure I completely agree with, but let me give this one. It relates to 
border security. We have someone who is a Member of this body who has 
publicly said that their priority, if they were elected to be 
President, would be to tear down borders, tear down walls, build 
bridges, and open the borders. Well, if you argue that there is a 
humanitarian crisis--and I have said there is already is one--what 
would prevent that President from issuing an Executive order that would 
divert military construction funding to tear down the walls that are 
going to be built now? If we give this President--a President I support 
and a President whose policies and priorities I agree with--that 
authority, that could be aiding and abetting a future President and 
empowering them beyond what I believe their authorities are, vested in 
the Constitution in article II.
  So I have come here today in part to maybe take another stab at 
explaining to my wife why I have taken this position but also to 
explain to the American people and folks in North Carolina and across 
this country. I agree with the President. I know we have a crisis we 
have to take care of. We have a national security crisis, a homeland 
security crisis, and a humanitarian crisis. It is not the end; it is a 
portion of the means.
  I applaud the President for taking the action up here and getting 
things going. I hope that over time, we can find a way to fully fund 
the border strategy on a bipartisan basis and also address other 
immigration issues that I believe are pressing for this Nation.
  Madam President, thank you for allowing me to come to the floor and 
explain my position.
  If anybody in North Carolina has any questions, I know they know how 
to get ahold of me because my phones are blowing up right now. But I do 
want to explain it to them in a way that makes sense. I am a steward of 
the U.S. Senate. I am a steward of the article I branch. That matters 
to me.
  Thank you, Madam President.",T000476,2019-02-26

                      Nomination of Eric D. Miller
",,2019-02-26
69,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,20,Ms. KLOBUCHAR,"  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to join many of my 
colleagues who have come to the floor and to express my opposition to 
the nomination of Eric Miller to be U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth 
Circuit. I have already expressed that opposition in my vote in the 
Judiciary Committee, but I would like to explain this in more detail.
  There are several troubling aspects of Mr. Miller's background, 
particularly his consistent opposition to Tribal interests and women's 
reproductive rights.
  My State of Minnesota has a large and diverse Tribal population. I 
have always believed that our State history has been drawn from the 
culture and traditions of our Native Americans.
  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I know that Tribal 
sovereignty is a fundamental tenet of our laws. The Ninth Circuit is 
home to more federally recognized Tribes than any other circuit--more 
than 425. So many of the cases that come before the court involve 
Tribal issues. I am concerned that Mr. Miller has a history of 
representing interests that have sought to undermine Tribal 
sovereignty. For example, in a brief he filed before the Supreme Court, 
he urged the Court to adopt a standard that would have undermined the 
legitimacy of many federally recognized Tribal governments.

  The National Congress of American Indians and the Native American 
Rights Fund have come out against his confirmation. I know the Senator 
from New Mexico, Mr. Udall, is here and understands the major concerns, 
since he is the ranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee, and how 
important that concern is. It is only the third time in the history of 
these two organizations--the National Congress of American Indians and 
the Native American Rights Fund--that they have opposed a judicial 
nominee.
  In their letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, they wrote that 
Eric


Miller ``chose to build a law practice on mounting repeated challenges 
to tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, and the core attribute 
of Federal recognition of Tribal existence.''
  I believe we need judges, particularly on the Ninth Circuit, who 
respect the history and contribution of Tribal nations, not one who 
seeks to undermine their sovereign status.
  Mr. Miller's record on women's reproductive rights is no less 
troubling. During his time at the Justice Department, he used 
ideological language in cases in which he advocated for restrictions on 
a woman's personal healthcare decisions. I am concerned about what this 
says about how Mr. Miller will approach these types of cases.
  Finally, it pains me to say that this is a historic moment for this 
body--for the Senate--because of how we came to be here today. It is 
not historic in a good sense of the word. It is historic in a bad sense 
of the word. We are voting on this nomination today because of an 
unprecedented disregard for the Senate's traditions when it comes to 
judicial nominations. According to the Congressional Research Service, 
no judge has ever been confirmed without having both blue slips 
returned by both home State Senators until now. We have had instances 
where one blue slip was returned, and the judge went on to be 
confirmed, but what we have here is not one blue slip from either of 
the home State Senators from the State of Washington was returned.
  Senator Cantwell, who also, by the way, has been a major leader when 
it comes to Tribal matters, did not return a blue slip for Mr. Miller. 
Senator Murray, a major leader when it comes to women's rights, did not 
return a blue slip for Mr. Miller.
  In the rush to confirm judges like Mr. Miller, the Judiciary 
Committee has chipped away at the traditions and rules that allow us to 
properly advise and consent on nominations, which is our responsibility 
specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
  This goes beyond disregarding the voices of home State Senators on 
judicial nominations. This nominee's hearing was held during a 
monthlong recess with no Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee. 
Since this was an established work period at home, only two Republican 
Members were in attendance. Mr. Miller's questioning lasted for less 
than 5 minutes for a lifetime appointment. Why would you have this 
hearing at a time when we were scheduled to be working in our home 
States? That is what happened because it was rammed through the Senate 
without the support of either of the home State Senators.
  At a time when the American people see this body shirking its 
responsibilities to act as a check and balance on the executive branch, 
and when they see us divided on the basic question of whether Congress 
has the power of the purse, I am concerned about what message we are 
sending to the country and the world about the health of this Senate.
  This is a lifetime appointment. It should at least have had a normal 
hearing. We should have at least respected the views of the home State 
Senators as we have so many times in the past. There are no winners in 
a race to the bottom when it comes to process in the Senate--a 
democratic process, a process of advice and consent, a process of 
checks and balances set up by our Founders so no one branch of 
government would have all the power.
  What do we see happening now? We see judges being put forward without 
blue slips. What that simply means is, the home State Senators are OK 
with that nominee. We have had blue slips over the years in many 
administrations for judges who perhaps were not the first choice of the 
home State Senators, but they were someone they felt could be a judge 
out of their State who would have the right experience as well as be 
fair and impartial in the administrative law.
  What else do we have going on? We have a President who, after an 
agreement was reached in the Senate, which is run by his own political 
party, on how to do border security--and it was a widespread vote in 
both the Senate and the House--he then decided to declare an emergency 
to do something which I consider unconstitutional and has no respect 
for the balance of powers. He decided he would declare an emergency, 
when, in fact, those kinds of emergencies are things like Hurricane 
Sandy and the weather we saw, and the damage down in Florida, or the 
wildfires we saw in Colorado and in California. Those are emergencies. 
In addition to that, it raises eminent domain issues at the border.
  It also makes us question where the money is coming from. That is why 
you see these lawsuits. The money is coming from the military budget, 
military construction for our troops, and the like.
  While this may seem like a very different issue, it is not a 
different issue. It is the same issue. The Senate should be sticking up 
for the individual States we represent and the power of those States 
and the power of that balance that is so important to running this 
government and to the very Constitution that guides us.

Miller to be circuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit.
  Senate traditions command respect, and if we are going to change 
them, we should do so in a bipartisan way. Changing rules midstream and 
changing traditions well into the Congress causes bitterness, acrimony, 
and it hurts our ability to work with each other. Such Senate 
traditions as the blue slip, where the nominee's home State Senators 
are given an opportunity to object--this courtesy has been in place for 
more than 100 years as part of the Senate's advice and consent 
responsibility.
  If confirmed, Mr. Miller would be the first circuit court nominee in 
history to be confirmed without having a blue slip returned from either 
of his home State Senators. The lack of respect shown for this Senate 
tradition by the Republican leadership of the Judiciary Committee is as 
saddening as it is alarming.
  Another Senate tradition again flouted by the majority was holding 
Mr. Miller's confirmation hearing during a Senate recess. The recess 
hearing--lasting only 30 minutes, with only two Republican Members in 
attendance--was objected to by Democratic Members who sought to 
question Mr. Miller on a number of legal issues, including Indian law. 
Instead, the questioning lasted less than 5 minutes.
  Bringing Mr. Miller's nomination to the floor without an adequate 
hearing is an abuse of the confirmation process by the Republican 
leadership of the Judiciary Committee.
  Putting aside these abuses of the process, as significant as they 
are, Mr. Miller's repeated willingness to side against Native American 
Tribes in court and the likelihood that such willingness will follow 
him to the bench where he would have an outsized influence on the 
development of Indian law for decades, concerns me deeply.
  As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I pay 
special attention to a nominee's record on Tribal issues, especially if 
a nominee will preside in a jurisdiction that has 427 Tribal nations, 
as is the case with Mr. Miller. I am concerned that Mr. Miller's record 
has not shown and does not have the proper respect for Tribal 
sovereignty.
  As an attorney in private practice, Mr. Miller consistently advocated 
against Tribal interests and Tribal sovereignty. In fact, Mr. Miller 
has donated over 675 hours of pro bono work against Tribal sovereignty, 
against Native American religious practices, Federal recognition, and 
numerous other respected Tribal doctrines.
  For example, in the case of Upper Skagit v. Lundgren, Mr. Miller 
argued that Tribal governments are not entitled to sovereign immunity 
because it interferes with the ``State's sovereign interest in 
adjudicating disputes over title to land within their territory and 
frustrate[s] the ordinary adjudication of competing [ownership] 
claims.'' His arguments in this case demonstrate he does not understand 
the inherent sovereignty of Tribal nations.
  Mr. Miller has shown a lack of respect for Native American religious 
practitioners when he argued for a narrow application of the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act when these practitioners argued that the 
construction of a solar farm would substantially burden their ability 
to conduct their religious practices.


  Mr. Miller has argued for an extremely narrow reading of the Indian 
Reorganization Act when considering the Federal recognition status of 
Tribes. He asserts that only Tribes that possessed federally managed 
lands when the act was passed in 1934 should be federally recognized. 
This narrow view does not acknowledge the well-established principles 
of Indian law and can lead to the termination of Tribal nations that do 
not meet his narrow and arbitrary standard.
  Mr. Miller's record on Tribal issues is one-sided and extreme. His 
history of advocating against Tribal interests does not give me 
confidence that he would be a fair and impartial jurist on the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals when Tribes come before him.
  I will vote no on Eric Miller's confirmation. I urge my colleagues to 
do so as well.

                        Remembering Jason Baker

  Madam President, I come here today in a sad time. As I speak, about 
right now in Montana, a funeral is beginning for Jason Baker.
  Jason was originally from Fort Benton, MT, which is a town right down 
the road from where I live in Big Sandy. Jason was a firefighter. Jason 
passed away on February 20, early in the morning. He was far, far too 
young--the age of 45. He had been a firefighter for 16 years with Great 
Falls Fire Rescue. He was incredibly talented and incredibly 
professional, and he was somebody who loved being a firefighter. His 
life of public service, whether it was helping out kids or helping out 
adults or helping out communities, was a part of who he was as a 
person.
  Jason was also married to my wife's cousin Jill. They have two 
children, Peyton and Porter, whose hearts have to be aching. This day 
is a day, I am sure, that they had to have planned for the last 3 or so 
years after his diagnosis of stage IV lung cancer. I guess it was 2 
years ago.
  I have a number of memories of Jason from my days in the State 
legislature, when he showed up as a relatively young firefighter, to my 
days as a U.S. Senator, when he showed up to my offices here in 
Washington, DC, to advocate for firefighters' issues. More important 
than all of that, Jason was a friend. He happened to also be a 
relative. He was somebody who, when his wife's grandfather passed away 
and they had the funeral up in Havre, was at the height of who he was 
as a human being. He wasn't sick and hadn't been diagnosed with 
anything. He was just vibrant and full of life.
  With cancer's being the disease that it is, it was a struggle for 
him, as it is for anybody who gets it. He was somebody who fought that 
disease bravely and proudly, but in the end, it took him. It took him 
last Wednesday, early in the morning. We were driving to Great Falls, 
and my wife sent a little message to Jill that read our hearts were 
with them because we knew that Jason wasn't good. She sent back a text 
with hearts, and that was it. He had already passed.
  In the end, though, as I think back on Jason's life, there are some 
lyrics to a song that say ``Only the good die young.'' It could not be 
any more true than with Jason Baker. If the world were full of Jason 
Bakers, this would be a better world, but life happens, and you have to 
get through it.
  I am sure that Jill and Peyton and Porter will think back and 
remember their dad proudly as he served proudly as a firefighter, as a 
public servant--as somebody who ran to danger while other people were 
running away from it.
  As they proceed with the ceremony today in Montana--and it is 
happening as I speak--just know, Jill, Peyton, Porter, and all of the 
firefighters who are there, that we are very proud of your dad and his 
service and what he fought for.
  Two years ago, there was a bill in the Montana Legislature on 
presumptive illness for firefighters. I do not believe Jason would have 
contracted cancer if not for his job, if not for the kinds of fumes he 
breathed when he protected neighborhoods and families. I think it is 
only right that when people sacrifice for their communities, we 
sacrifice for them. Two years ago, the legislature did not pass that 
presumptive illness bill. I think it made a mistake.
  When I gave my speech to the House of Representatives in the Montana 
Legislature, one of the points I made in that speech was that they 
needed to pass the presumptive healthcare bill for firefighters. Jason 
was alive when I gave that speech, and now he has passed. I think, in 
memory of Jason Baker, at the very least, the Montana Legislature could 
pass that bill. I understand it has passed one of the houses but that 
it hasn't passed both of them. If it passes both houses, I know 
Governor Bullock will sign that bill.
  So, with that, we bid adieu to a great American, a great community 
man--somebody who literally gave it all for his country and his State 
and his town.
  We will miss you, Jason Baker.

                      Nomination of Eric D. Miller
",,2019-02-26
77,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,28,Mr. BLUMENTHAL,"  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, we are in the midst of a stealth 
campaign. Normally, we think about ``stealth'' as associated with 
bombers or submarines, weapons platforms designed to go, in effect, 
under the radar, to avoid detection, to escape public notice or the 
notice of our adversaries.
  This stealth campaign is really hiding in plain sight. It is a 
campaign to remake our Federal judiciary in the image of the far-right 
extreme of the Republican Party, the far-right extreme ideologically 
and politically, a campaign, in effect, to outsource selections of 
judges to groups that reflect those extreme points of view--the 
Heritage Society and other such groups.
  Shortly, we will consider the nomination of the latest individual 
nominated by the President, outsourced to those groups: Eric Miller, of 
Washington, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The effort here is 
to drastically reshape our judiciary but, in the process, also 
dismantle the norms and practices critical to the health of our 
democracy. The judiciary is essential to the health of our democracy.
  In the future, when we look back on this era--a dark and dangerous 
time for our democracy--the heroes will be our free press and our 
independent judiciary because they have been selected in the past by 
both Republican and Democratic Presidents based on qualities of 
integrity, intelligence, and independence.
  That norm, common to both Republican and Democratic administrations 
in the past, has been broken by this one. One of the norms that has 
been broken in the U.S. Senate relates to the use of blue slips. Most 
of the public has no idea what blue slips are. They are the traditional 
mechanism used over decades to afford home State Senators the 
opportunity to express their approval or disapproval for fitness, a 
basic quality of a President's judicial nominee to a court that has 
jurisdiction over their State.
  What is the reason? Well, Senators just happen to spend a lot of time 
talking with folks at home. We talk to farmers, businesspeople, 
lawyers. A lot of those lawyers know fellow lawyers. Of course, we 
receive the ABA qualified or unqualified ratings, but they are single 
words based on fact gathering that may or may not be as reliable as our 
colleagues--the lawyers who appear in front of judges, who go to court 
every day, who have settlement conferences, who rely on the word of 
their colleagues, which is either good or bad, who know their integrity 
and intelligence, who know whether they have the temperament to sit in 
judgment of cases that will have enduring and irreparable ramifications 
for the litigants who appear in front of them.
  Respecting the blue-slip tradition ensures that when there is a 
Federal judicial vacancy--for Connecticut, for example--that the 
President nominate a qualified candidate from Connecticut with the 
advice and consent of Connecticut Senators. The same is true for the 
Presiding Officer's home State of


Tennessee or any of the other States involved here. I am sure my 
colleagues from Texas or North Carolina or wherever would want a 
Democratic President to consult them when making appointments to the 
courts that have jurisdiction over the people, the litigants, the folks 
who have to go to court with their grievances in their States. Blue 
slips may be a courtesy, but they are important to the functioning of 
our society.

  Until the Trump administration, only five judges had ever been 
confirmed with only one blue slip in the last 100 years. That means one 
Senator from that State objected. Only five went through with that one 
objection and with the other Senator saying OK.
  To our knowledge, no judge has ever been confirmed without having 
both blue slips from their home State Senators. Eric Miller would be a 
first.
  Sometimes it is good to be a first but not so here. We are witnessing 
another norm being shattered in realtime. We need to know from the 
majority: Is this the road we really want to go down in this Chamber?
  I take my constitutional responsibilities very seriously, especially 
when it comes to the confirmation of judges, as someone who has spent 
most of my professional career in the courtroom, either as a lawyer in 
private practice or a U.S. attorney for Connecticut or as attorney 
general in my State for 20 years.
  This issue is important because not only is it a matter of courtesy, 
but it is a matter of completeness.
  This nomination is a stealth nomination in a very important sense, 
also, as far as the process for his confirmation is concerned. Only one 
Senator--one Senator--has actually asked him questions on the record in 
public. That is because his confirmation hearing was scheduled at a 
time when only one Member of the U.S. Senate was there to ask him 
questions.
  It was held during a month-long recess in October. Only two members 
of the committee--Senators Hatch and Crapo--could attend the hearing. 
Only Senator Crapo questioned Mr. Miller for a 5-minute round of 
questions.
  All 10 Democratic members of the Judiciary, including me, wrote to 
Senator Grassley to have the hearing rescheduled. We asked, and he 
refused. We wrote Senator Grassley again to have a second hearing so 
that the full committee could provide advice and consent after 
questioning Mr. Miller's nomination. We had no success.
  If Mr. Miller is confirmed, he will have been questioned by that one 
Senator, Mr. Crapo--out of 100--for a grand total of 5 minutes. That is 
not the way this system should work.
  I do take my constitutional responsibilities seriously. This process 
makes a sham of the obligations we all have a sworn duty to fulfill.
  In conclusion, let me say that in November of 2018, the Ninth Circuit 
ruled against the President. He described that case as ``a disgrace.'' 
He painted the ruling of the Ninth Circuit as biased by describing one 
of the judges as an ``Obama judge.'' President Trump ultimately stated 
that the Ninth Circuit is ``not fair'' because every case the 
administration files in the Ninth Circuit results in a loss.
  He has made no secret of his frustration about judges generally, 
whether they were chosen by Republican or Democratic Presidents in the 
past. He has made no secret of his contempt for judges who uphold the 
rule of law and, as Chief Justice Roberts said, ``do equal right to 
those appearing before them.''
  Chief Justice Roberts also stated that an ``independent judiciary is 
something we should all be thankful for.''
  The nomination of Eric Miller betrays that essential principle of the 
American judiciary. It diminishes and reduces the independence of our 
judiciary at a level that we can ill afford and at a time when 
independence is most important. I think this nomination is particularly 
objectionable in light of that lack of independence.
  Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by the National Congress of 
American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, Winnebago Tribe of 
Nebraska, and NARAL Pro-Choice America because of positions he has 
taken. Those positions are also objectionable to me, but what is most 
important is his lack of independence, the lack of proper process in 
his confirmation, and his lack of qualifications for this job.
  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against him today.
  Thank you.

79,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,30,Ms. CORTEZ MASTO,"  Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition 
to the nomination of Eric Miller to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
  As an attorney and former attorney general, like my good colleague 
from Connecticut, I have a deep respect and appreciation for our 
Federal judiciary. I believe that carefully guarding the professional 
reputation of our Federal bench is critical to maintaining respect for 
the rule of law in our country.
  The American people must be able to trust that our Federal judges 
will be fair and neutral arbiters of any dispute before them. So in 
considering whether a nominee is deserving of the awesome 
responsibility of a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, we must 
carefully evaluate their professional and personal qualifications to 
ensure that they are of the highest intellectual, professional, and 
moral caliber.
  I have carefully reviewed Mr. Miller's record, and I believe that he 
is the wrong candidate to fill this judicial seat. I believe my 
Republican colleagues know it. That is why they have made every effort 
to jam this confirmation through.
  The majority-led Judiciary Committee and Republican leadership have 
taken extraordinary steps to rush this nomination. Republicans held Mr. 
Miller's confirmation hearing during an October recess, without the 
consent of minority members of the committee, questioning him for just 
5 minutes and then gaveling out. As you heard, only two Senators were 
at that hearing. That is not regular order in the Senate.
  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership continues to attack regular 
order in the Senate by attacking Senate precedent. This nominee, if 
confirmed, will be the first circuit court judge advanced without the 
support of either of their home State Senators. That is the blue-slip 
process.
  The blue-slip process is an essential tradition of respecting the 
wishes of each nominee's home State Senators, and it is the start of 
the advice and consent process.
  This is about our system of checks and balances, respecting one 
another, and the prerogatives of the Senate that ensure every Senator 
has a voice in the selection of judges in their home State. This 
institutional check has never been more important than it is today 
because we have a President who undermines the legitimacy and 
impartiality of the courts.
  By bringing up this confirmation for a vote before the Senate, 
Republican leaders are circumventing Senators, ignoring the people we 
were elected to represent, and damaging our critical role in 
appropriately deliberating on lifetime judicial nominees and 
representing the will of our constituents who elected us. This is a 
dereliction of the Senate's duty, and it is an assault on our 
institutions.
  If confirmed, Mr. Miller will have a lifetime appointment to one of 
the highest courts in America. He will make decisions on our Nation's 
most important issues and will have the power to change Americans' 
lives. Yet this Republican leadership believes a 5-minute hearing is 
enough for a circuit court nominee who doesn't have the support of his 
own home State Senators.
  When the confirmation process is rushed like this, critical 
information about the history and character of the nominees will be 
missed. These lapses undermine the integrity of our confirmation 
process and ultimately undermine the public's faith in our Federal 
judiciary.
  I share many of the same concerns of Senators Cantwell and Murray 
about Mr. Miller's views on Tribal sovereignty and other critical 
issues. Mr. Miller's past work in undermining Tribal sovereignty and 
Tribal rights raises questions about how he would treat Tribes who come 
before him as a circuit court judge. His confirmation could have 
serious ramifications for Native communities in Washington, Nevada, and 
across the country.
  Each one of us is elected to represent our State and its people. 
Today's move by the majority is nothing less than an assault on our 
oath to the Constitution and our duty to serve our constituents.


  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this nomination and stand together 
in a bipartisan way to confirm nominees who reflect our States, our 
country, and respect the Senators.
  Thank you.

83,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1458-2,34,Mrs. MURRAY,"  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here joining my colleagues on the 
floor to sound the alarm because right now, this Senate is being 
steered down a very dangerous path. I spoke last night about this and 
laid out my case, and I am here again to make it one more time.
  Republican leaders are now barreling toward a confirmation vote on a 
Ninth Circuit nominee--a flashpoint that, if it succeeds, will mark a 
massive departure from the longstanding bipartisan process that has 
been in place for generations. It is a bipartisan process that has 
helped this Senate put consensus nominees on the bench for as long as 
we have all been here. This is wrong, and it is the American people who 
we represent who will be hurt.
  Let's recap the facts. Neither I nor my colleague Senator Cantwell 
returned a blue slip on the nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the 
Ninth Circuit court. I have deep concerns about Mr. Miller's work 
fighting against Tribes. Despite our objections, Republicans went ahead 
with Mr. Miller's confirmation hearing during a Senate recess when just 
two Senators--both Republicans--were able to attend, and the hearing 
included less than 5 minutes of questioning. It was a sham hearing. It 
was simply done to check the box.
  For this Senate to go ahead and confirm this Ninth Circuit court 
nominee without the consent of or true input from both home State 
Senators and after a sham hearing--that would be a dangerous first for 
this Senate.
  This is not a partisan issue; this is a question of this Senate's 
ability and commitment to properly review nominees.
  The only logical conclusion I can draw as to why we are here at these 
crossroads is that Republican leaders are hoping that most Americans 
won't notice, that they are doing everything in their power to pander 
to President Trump and in doing that are trampling all over Senate 
norms in order to move our courts to the far right.
  We are standing here today because this is too important and because 
the short- and long-term consequences of letting any President 
steamroll the Senate on something as critical as our judicial nominees 
are far too important.
  Abandoning the blue-slip process and instead bending to the will of a 
President, by the way, who has demonstrated time and again his 
ignorance and disdain for the Constitution and rule of law is a 
mistake. At a time when we have a President whose policies keep testing 
the limits of the law--from a ban on Muslims entering the United 
States, to a family separation policy at our southern border, to 
declaring a national emergency without a real emergency--it is now more 
important than ever that we have well-qualified, consensus judges on 
the bench.
  This new precedent of my Republican colleagues turning a blind eye to 
the blue slip and shunning longstanding bipartisan processes should 
stop every one of my colleagues, Republican or Democratic, in their 
tracks because today the two home State Senators left holding their 
blue slips are me and my colleague Senator Cantwell, but in the future, 
it could be any Member of this body. Today it is Washington State 
families who are getting cut out from an important process. It is their 
concerns about Eric Miller's long history of fighting against Tribal 
rights that will be cast aside. But tomorrow it could be the concerns 
of any of your constituents and any of your home States that get tossed 
aside for a President's crusade to reshape our courts and satisfy their 
political base, and it could be your constituents and your home States 
hurt by Senate leaders unwilling to stand up for norms and precedents 
and our constitutional duty.
  Again, I am here today to urge my colleagues to truly think about 
what moving ahead with this nomination means and to ask themselves, are 
we still able to work together in a bipartisan way and find common 
ground for the good of the country and the people we serve? Can we 
still even engage in a bipartisan process to find consensus candidates 
to serve on our courts, or will our work in the Senate be reduced to 
partisan extremes and political gamesmanship? Will Republicans accept 
simply being a rubberstamp for their leader in the White House? Will my 
colleagues be complicit in allowing our courts to be taken over by 
ideology alone, abandoning pragmatism and a commitment to justice for 
all? That is a choice every Senator faces now and, I sincerely hope, a 
choice for which every Senator will be held accountable.

Senate did make progress in another area. Yesterday, we advanced what 
will be the 31st circuit court nomination to be confirmed so far during 
the Trump administration.
  As I discussed yesterday, Eric Miller has a distinguished record in 
both public service and private practice. He holds degrees from Harvard 
and the University of Chicago, and his legal experience includes 
holding prestigious clerkships on our Nation's highest courts. Yet, 
rather than take my word for it, I urge my colleagues to consider the 
endorsements of those with whom the nominee has studied and worked.
  For example, 54 members of the University of Chicago Law School's 
class of 1999, with their wide-ranging views on politics and judicial 
philosophy, have offered a ringing endorsement for Eric Miller. In a 
letter to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, they cite Mr. 
Miller's ``diligent work ethic, his keen legal mind, and his deep 
consideration for every legal issue he confronts.'' All in all, his 
classmates--many of whom have also been his colleagues over the years--
say that Mr. Miller is ``extraordinarily well qualified to serve as a 
Federal judge.''
  I urge each of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm this 
fine nominee soon.

94,VOTER FRAUD,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1447-7,0,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on a final matter, anyone who has 
been attentive to the news these past few days has learned about the 
complete debacle that unfolded in last November's election for North 
Carolina's Ninth Congressional District. Soon after election day, 
allegations of illegal ballot harvesting and vote tampering clouded a 
close result. The wrongdoing seemed to have benefited the Republican 
candidate over the Democratic. Just last week, we saw the State Board 
of Elections unanimously call for a new election.
  For years and years, every Republican who dared to call for 
commonsense safeguards for Americans' ballots


was demonized by Democrats and their allies. We were hit with leftwing 
talking points that insisted that voter fraud was not real--it never 
happens, they said--that fraud just didn't happen and that modest 
efforts to ensure that voters are who they say they are and are voting 
in the proper places were really some sinister, rightwing plot to 
prevent people from voting.
  As you might expect, now that an incident of very real voter fraud 
has become national news and the Republican candidate seems to have 
benefited, these longstanding Democratic talking points have been 
really quiet. We haven't heard much lately from the Democrats about how 
fraud never happens. They have gone silent. Now some are singing a 
different tune. There is a new interest in ensuring the sanctity of 
American elections.
  I have been focused for decades on protecting the integrity of 
elections, so I would like to welcome my friends on the left to their 
new realization. They have just discovered that this subject really 
matters, but I have yet to see any evidence that they are actually 
interested in cleaning up the conditions that lead to messes like this 
one in North Carolina.
  At the root of the North Carolina debacle is a practice that is known 
as ballot harvesting. Essentially, it is a means by which campaign 
representatives can collect absentee ballots on the premise of 
delivering them to a polling place or an election office. That is what 
ballot harvesting is. So think about it. Who in American politics keeps 
long lists of potential voters? Who mobilizes networks of people to go 
door-to-door? Who funds and stands up to these kinds of canvassing 
organizations? Who does those things?
  I am sorry to say that there are not huge teams of politically 
neutral Eagle Scouts who rove the country and hope to use ballot 
harvesting to politely make voters' lives more convenient. This is not 
an Eagle Scout activity. The folks who really lick their lips at the 
prospect of mass ballot harvesting are political operatives, of 
course--political operatives, interest groups, and one-sided political 
machines. This is why many jurisdictions, including in North Carolina, 
have outlawed the practice altogether. I will say that again. Many 
jurisdictions, including in North Carolina, have outlawed this practice 
altogether.
  Ballot harvesting threatens to change the nature of our 
representative democracy. Forget about persuading people and spurring 
them to turn out to the polls; this practice makes elections a kind of 
scavenger hunt to see which side's operatives can return to 
headquarters with the most ballots in the trunks of their cars, and 
once those operatives take ahold of these ballots, the voters have no 
way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered.
  Of course, a system that invites political operatives to be rewarded 
for turning up ballots will open the door to misbehavior. Remember, it 
is illegal in North Carolina and in most States for the obvious reason, 
but I have noted with interest that the Democrats' new focus on this 
practice has yet to extend to California. I wonder why. Well, in 
California, it is legal. It is a common practice in California. 
California allows anyone--not just family members but anyone--to show 
up at polling places on election day with ballots that are not theirs. 
Welcome to California.
  Reports suggest that Orange County alone saw--listen to this--250,000 
absentee ballots dropped off on election day last year. The county's 
registrar told the newspaper that some individuals dropped off hundreds 
of other people's ballots. We have no way to know if those ballots were 
sealed or if the people had even voted when they were harvested. The 
only evidence we have that the voter cast his or her ballot is the 
signature.
  This past election cycle turned out favorably for California 
Democrats, amazingly enough. These late-arriving ballots seemed to help 
turn several races their way. Maybe this helps explain why: When House 
GOP leaders expressed concern over ballot harvesting in California, the 
State's Democratic secretary of state mocked their concern by saying: 
``What they call strange and bizarre we call democracy.'' Now ballot 
harvesting has thrown out an election result in the U.S. House of 
Representatives--legal in California, illegal in North Carolina.
  Maybe that helps explain why, as it stands, the Democrat Politician 
Protection Act--Speaker Pelosi's massive new Federal takeover of the 
way States and communities run their elections--contains no effort 
whatsoever to crack down on ballot harvesting. It is not in there. 
Instead, it contains provision after provision that would erode the 
protections that are supposed to ensure votes reflect the voices of the 
voters whose names are on the envelopes.
  It contains provision after provision that would erode the 
protections that are supposed to ensure that votes reflect the voice of 
the voter whose name is on the envelope.
  Provision after provision would erode commonsense protections and 
bring the guardrails down. So would a serious reform bill aimed to take 
away States' abilities to impose meaningful ID or signature 
requirements for voters. Would someone concerned about restoring 
democracy dismiss signature verification as an obstacle to be removed? 
I don't think so.
  Perhaps these facts signal that Democrats see a political advantage 
in eroding commonsense protections and would rather keep that advantage 
than make episodes like the North Carolina mess less likely to happen 
in the future.
  An example of real-live voter fraud is staring the country right in 
the face right now in North Carolina. Yet Democrats choose at this 
moment to propose a sprawling Federal takeover of election law that 
would erode the integrity of our elections even further.
  So that, I think, pretty well underscores what the priorities of 
today's Democrat Party is.

96,FEDERAL DEBT,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1485,0,Mr. PAUL,"  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as I stand before you, we are facing a 
financial calamity that could make the last financial crisis look like 
the good old days. I have become aware of a committee of respected 
financial industry experts that has developed a Debt Default Clock, 
which conceptualizes the risk associated with a potential Federal debt 
crisis that leads to the insolvency of the government. The Debt Default 
Clock is the same concept as the famous Doomsday Clock, only in this 
case illustrating how close we are to fiscal meltdown.
  The Debt Default Clock has 12 factors that are used to measure the 
risk associated with the burgeoning Federal debt. The Clock currently 
stands at 4 minutes to midnight, which means that insolvency of the 
Federal Government is close at hand, and we have little time to act. 
Although the 12 criteria were developed on the basis of defining the 
circumstances leading to government insolvency and default, they were 
also created with the idea of identifying metrics that can be measured, 
watched, and compared over time to identify the time remaining before 
the sequence of insolvency and default. Eight of these factors are 
already in negative territory, and the others are moving in that 
direction.
  In 2010, I ran for the Senate out of concern that our out-of-control 
debt might finally take us off the cliff. It is frustration with 
rampant, deficit-financed spending that sparked the Tea Party; yet the 
situation continues to get worse. So I urge my colleagues to find out 
more about the Debt Default Clock and the role of Congress, the 
administration, and the States as to how each of the factors might be 
mitigated if the political will exists to do so before calamity hits us 
square in the face.
  Accordingly, I respectfully request that the following information 
related to the Debt Default Clock be printed in the Record.",P000603,2019-02-26

98,GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2220-4,0,Mrs. HAYES,"  Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for two 
bills that the House will consider this week: H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. 
These bills are the first comprehensive gun violence prevention bills 
to be considered in the House since the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act was signed into law in 1994.
  Far too often innocent lives are claimed due to gun violence. Nearly 
40,000 people die of gun-related injuries per year.
  While mass shootings often dominate the headlines, we cannot continue 
to turn a blind eye to the gun violence happening on a daily basis in 
cities all over the country and even my own hometown of Waterbury, 
Connecticut. I have lived in a neighborhood where the sound of gunshots 
in the distance was as normal as hearing church bells, and, as a 
teacher and a mother, I have seen firsthand how the fear of violence 
affects our children.
  For far too long, Congress has failed our communities by remaining 
silent on this issue. America is ready for commonsense background check 
legislation. I owe it to my community, I owe it to my State, and I owe 
it to the people of Newtown, Connecticut. That is why I look forward to 
casting my vote in support of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.

99,TRIBUTE TO RONALD H. ROBERTS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE211-2,0,Mr. CALVERT,"  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to 
my good friend Ronald ``Ron'' Roberts, who passed away in San Diego, 
California on Monday, February 4, 2019. Ron was a dedicated public 
servant and he will be deeply missed.
  Throughout his life, Ron worked to improve the community around him. 
In the first phase of his public service, Ron worked as a California 
Highway Patrol officer. By the time he retired, Ron had risen to the 
rank of sergeant. After his career in law enforcement, Ron began what 
would eventually be a twenty-four-year dedication to the city of 
Temecula. Ron was first appointed to the Temecula Traffic Commission in 
1990, the year after the city incorporated.
  In 1992, Ron was elected to the Temecula City Council, where he would 
ultimately serve five consecutive terms, from 1992 to 2014, including 
five terms as the city's mayor. The impact of Ron's leadership and hard 
work is on display today throughout Temecula, particularly in its 
infrastructure, facilities, parks and libraries. In fact, the city 
honored Ron by naming its busiest library the Ronald H. Roberts 
Temecula Public Library. Ron was also rightfully proud of his work 
granting public use of the Duck Pond at the corner of Ynez and Rancho 
California roads and revitalizing Old Town Temecula. Extraordinary 
cities like Temecula don't exist by accident--they come to fruition 
thanks to the vision and activism of tireless advocates like Ron 
Roberts.
  Ron is survived by his wife, Jeanne; son Ron, Jr. (wife Kara); 
daughter Wendy (husband Sam); and five grandchildren. I extend my 
heartfelt condolences to the Roberts family, his friends, and everyone 
fortunate enough to know Ron. Although Ron may be gone, the many 
contributions he made to his country, community and family will have a 
lasting impact.

100,EMERGENCY DECLARATION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2105-5,0,The SPEAKER pro tempore,"  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Malinowski) for 5 minutes.",,2019-02-26
101,EMERGENCY DECLARATION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2105-5,1,Mr. MALINOWSKI,"  Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge that we come together 
today to defend the Constitution of the United States by repudiating 
President Trump's emergency declaration of February 15.
  Few provisions of the Constitution are more plain than Article I, 
Section 9, Clause 7: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but 
in consequence of appropriations made by law.''
  The President has immense powers, but he cannot spend money unless 
we, the people's Representatives in Congress, have agreed that he can.
  Now, there might be extraordinary circumstances when a President 
could violate that principle, when all of us would agree that he must 
act but there is no time to ask Congress for funds: a military invasion 
or a massive natural disaster, for example. The National Emergencies 
Act provides for that.
  But if the situation on the southern border were that kind of 
emergency, then the President hasn't been acting like it. For 2 years, 
when his party controlled the House and Senate, he never asked us for 
money to build a wall, and if we truly faced that kind of imminent 
threat, a wall would not even be an emergency measure given how long it 
would take to build.
  The critical point is this: When the President finally got around to 
asking us for money, we deliberated on his request, and we said no. You 
may believe we were right or you may believe we were wrong, but that is 
what the elected Representatives of the American people decided.
  So the question before us today is not how do we secure the border; 
it is whether this President or any President can use emergency powers 
to defy the Congress when he disagrees with a


decision that we have made. Are we going to stand by and watch this 
President seize funds from the military to forcibly take land from law-
abiding American citizens to build something that Congress has said 
should not be built?
  We know this would be wrong. The National Emergencies Act is for 
genuine emergencies. It is not a get-out-of-the-Constitution-free card 
for Presidents who want something that Congress won't give them.
  Now, I have heard some people say that President Obama did the same 
thing. I am sorry, he did not. Both President Obama and President Bush 
were sometimes accused of exceeding their constitutional authority; the 
courts sometimes overruled them. But neither Obama nor Bush nor Nixon 
nor Reagan nor Roosevelt nor Lincoln nor any President since the 
founding of our Republic has ever decreed an emergency to spend money 
that the Congress explicitly denied them.

  If you want to find a precedent for what President Trump has done, I 
can give you one. When I was a diplomat representing our country and 
standing up for our values around the world, I had this exact same 
debate with authoritarian governments in Ethiopia, in Bahrain, and in 
Egypt, telling them: Do not use emergency powers to get around your 
constitutions. I never thought I would have that kind of argument with 
a President of the United States.
  Many of my Republican colleagues have been saying that America must 
not go the way of Venezuela, and they are right. When President Trump 
said in his State of the Union that we must never become a socialist 
country, I joined them in getting to my feet and applauding.
  But how do you think Venezuela got to be a socialist country? I will 
tell you. President Maduro declared a state of economic emergency to 
give himself the power to defy his elected national assembly and spend 
money however he pleased.
  That is not America. We must never become that. We believe in rule of 
law, not rule by decree.
  We disagree passionately within the boundaries the Constitution 
draws, but we agree zealously to defend those boundaries when any one 
of our party or any party tries to cross those boundaries. That is how 
we have survived as a constitutional democracy. It is the only way we 
can survive.
  We are divided enough right now, so, please, let's not allow another 
tear in the constitutional fabric that holds us together. Let's unite 
as patriots on this one question so that we can safely disagree as 
partisans on everything else.

102,IGNORING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL BORDERS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2111-3,0,Mr. DOGGETT,"  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the serious border emergency that America 
is confronted with today is an emergency that Donald Trump has created 
by ignoring borders--ignoring the borders set forth in our 
Constitution, borders that were set forth to prevent an all-powerful 
executive, a would-be king, or the type of tyrant that Trump so admires 
abroad.
  After Congress repeatedly rejected his phony border crisis and 
wasteful wall, Trump decided: build it anyway.
  Well, today's emergency wouldn't have happened without two years of 
Republicans who have continued to yield the right-of-way to his 
creeping wrongdoing--more and more of it--Republicans who can just 
never summon the ability to say ``no'' to Trump.
  Today, we must reject this unconstitutional power grab that diverts 
resources from real threats to an imaginary, politically contrived one.
  Today, we defend our Constitution and our democracy by pushing back 
on the lies, the deceit, the anti-immigrant hysteria, and the fear-
mongering mismanagement of this administration.",D000399,2019-02-26

105,ETHYLENE OXIDE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2110-7,0,Mr. SCHNEIDER,"  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, every parent deserves to have confidence 
that the air they and their children breathe is safe. That is why we 
have environmental standards and why we have an Environmental 
Protection Agency to monitor, update, and enforce the rules.
  So, when communities face a known public risk, new or recently 
reclassified, we rightly expect the EPA to act--quickly, 
comprehensively, and transparently.
  In the Chicago area, this, sadly, has not been the case. Ethylene 
oxide, or EtO, was reclassified as a known carcinogen more than 2 years 
ago, yet we just recently learned facilities around Chicago could be 
emitting it at elevated levels.
  The EPA has been unacceptably slow to respond and has failed to keep 
affected communities informed.
  This month, I partnered with Senators Durbin and Duckworth and other 
colleagues in my delegation to introduce legislation that would require 
the EPA to immediately revise and update its EtO standards and to keep 
the public fully informed.
  We are also demanding that EPA evaluate ambient levels of EtO in 
these communities immediately, something it should be doing already.
  Our communities deserve more from the EPA. This is about our families 
and their public health.

106,TRIBUTE TO OLIVER DIEZ,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1487-4,0,Mr. RUBIO," Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today I recognize Oliver Diez, the 
Miami-Dade County Teacher of the Year from Palmetto Elementary School 
in Pinecrest, FL.
  Oliver received this award in recognition for his dedication to 
teaching children a passion for music before they leave elementary 
school. He begins teaching students how to play an introductory 
instrument, the recorder, at an early age. From there, they can join 
one of his school's before and afterschool offerings of chorus, concert 
band, jazz combo, orchestra, and drum-line. Once they join a music 
program, his lessons focus on teaching them not only how to play 
instruments, but also its history. He believes this builds an 
appreciation for music in his young students.
  Throughout his two-decade long teaching career at Palmetto Elementary 
School, he has built a successful music program at south Florida's 
largest elementary school. His fourth and fifth grade student were 
invited to play at Carnegie Hall in New York City this March, the only 
elementary school students to play. While he believes teaching is messy 
at times, he knows it unites students to work together for the final 
performance.
  Oliver graduated from Florida International University with his 
bachelor's degree in 1999 and returned for his master's degree in 2016, 
both majoring in music education. He also helped launch a booster club 
at his school that is a registered nonprofit for travel expenses for 
performances.
  I express my sincere appreciation to Oliver for all of the 
accomplished work with his students and wish him continued success in 
the years to come.

Month, and I am taking some time to remember African Americans who have 
made a difference in the community where I live.
  I rise today to honor one of my community's civil rights and 
community leaders, Mr. Nelson Polite, Sr., of Lancaster. Mr. Polite was 
one of the early leaders in the civil rights movement in Lancaster in 
the 1960s. He was a fierce advocate who worked hard to change the 
unjust policies of segregation.
  Mr. Polite devoted his life to the ideals of fairness and justice for 
everyone, regardless of their skin color. He organized protests against 
Whites-only admittance at Rocky Springs pool and followed in the 
footsteps of his father, who helped found the Lancaster NAACP.
  Mr. Polite led by example and represented the goodness of our 
community. He was active in his church and worked to ensure that 
residents had job opportunities, housing, and overall quality of life.
  He served as a Lancaster councilman for 12 years. This month, Black

115,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1494,0,Ms. HIRONO,"  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my 
support for the Child Care for Working Families Act, which I was proud 
to introduce earlier this afternoon with Senators Murray, Casey, and 30 
of our Senate colleagues.
  We know that investments in early childhood programs are foundational 
for future academic and social success. Yet child care remains 
unaffordable for too many working families in the United States.
  For parents worried about how to pay for basic living expenses like 
housing, food, education, and transportation, increasing child care 
costs can place a heavy burden on family budgets.
  As a young immigrant from Japan who was raised by a single, working 
mother, I understand the difficult decisions families have to make 
every day to survive. I have experienced these challenges firsthand. 
Yet, all these years later, for many Hawaii families, child care costs 
exceed all other expenses besides housing.
  On average, Hawaii parents can expect to pay $8,280 per year, or $690 
per month, in child care expenses. These costs are 25 percent higher 
than they were just a decade ago, but wages have hardly kept pace. As a 
result, Hawaii families will dedicate around 11 percent of their family 
budget to child care--exceeding the government's standard for 
affordable care.
  Unfortunately, even for families that can afford child care, finding 
that needed care may be difficult. This is because our early childhood 
educators and child care workers are overworked and underpaid. In 
addition, there is a severe need for more facilities to accommodate the 
families that need them. The need is great, and that is why the Child 
Care for Working Families Act is so important. This legislation will 
make sure working families have access to high-quality, affordable 
early childhood programs.
  Specifically, the bill expands the existing Child Care and 
Development Block Grant program to guarantee that working and middle 
class families have access to affordable child care--ensuring that 
these families do not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income 
toward care, regardless of how many children they have.
  The bill also expands Head Start to promote universal preschool for 
young children.
  Additionally, the bill also addresses the need to support our early 
childhood workers by making sure teachers, care givers, and other 
workers responsible for our children are fairly-compensated and fully-
supported with training and professional development opportunities.
  These are the core provisions of the bill, which represents an 
essential investment in the stability and prosperity of working 
families in Hawaii and across our Nation. Every family deserves access 
to high-quality, affordable early childhood programs, and we will 
continue fighting to make child care more affordable for all children.
  I thank my colleagues for their continued support in this effort, and 
urge support for this important legislation.

116,RECOGNIZING THE FORT SMITH NOON LIONS CLUB,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1487-3,0,Mr. BOOZMAN," Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize and 
congratulate the Fort Smith Noon Lion's Club on its centennial 
celebration.
  The Fort Smith Noon Lions Club first met on March 8, 1919, only 2 
years after the creation of Lions Club International. With 25 charter 
members, the club's mission was to encourage fellowship and civic 
participation by local businessmen. Many prominent business leaders 
were part of that founding group, including Dr. Charles Holt, founder 
of Holt Crock Clinic; Fagan Bourland, who served as the city's mayor 
for many years; and W.E. Harding, the founder of Harding Glass, one of 
the city's largest companies at the time.
  The club met for many years at the historic Goldman Hotel in downtown 
Fort Smith and, later, at the Ward Hotel on Garrison Avenue. Among its 
earliest projects was supporting the Victory Loan Campaign designed to 
pay off debt from WWI. In the early days, it held festivals, hosted 
free concerts, and played an annual baseball game against the local 
Rotary Club.
  In addition to supporting local causes and providing a networking 
tool for businessmen, the club's mission came into focus after Helen 
Keller spoke at the Lions Club International convention in 1925. She 
concluded her speech by saying, ``I appeal to you Lions, you who have 
your sight, your hearing, you who are strong and brave and kind. Will 
you not constitute yourselves Knights of the Blind in this crusade 
against darkness?'' Her eloquent plea transformed the Lions and made 
sight conservation the organization's primary mission.
  Throughout its 100-year history, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has 
contributed greatly to this mission by raising money to provide eye 
exams and glasses to local students and adults. Lions Club members have 
also collected thousands of pairs of glasses which are donated to the 
Southern College of Optometry in Memphis where students take the 
glasses on international mission trips.
  In recent years, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has donated more than 
$100,000 to help local residents with sight preservation and provided 
support to many local children's organizations including the Fort Smith 
Boys Club, Good Samaritan Clinic, Clearinghouse Backpack Program, 
Special Olympics, and the Children's Emergency Shelter.
  In addition, the club has provided all of the equipment and support 
needed for the Safety Patrol program in the Fort Smith Public Schools 
since 1946.
  As an optometrist whose hometown is Fort Smith, AR, I am proud of the 
great work done by this club and Lions chapters around the world.
  I congratulate the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club on its 100th 
anniversary and hope that these Knights for the Blind continue to

117,CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MRS. ELLEN GREANEY JACOBS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE209-3,0,Mr. PERRY,"  Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, today I offer my heartfelt congratulations 
to Mrs. Ellen Greaney Jacobs, a resident of Dauphin County, 
Pennsylvania, who is celebrating 100 years young on Monday, April 1, 
2019.
  Mrs. Jacobs was born in Bound Brook, New Jersey, and moved to New 
Bloomfield, Pennsylvania with her mother, brother and two sisters after 
her father died. Ellen graduated from New Bloomfield High School and 
the Carlisle Commercial College. She married her husband of 69 years, 
Cyrus D. Jacobs, in Westminster, Maryland on September 24, 1938. Ellen 
has three sons, six grandchildren, and twelve great grandchildren.
  Ellen is an active member of the Order of the Eastern Star (Capitol 
City Chapter), Dauphin Middle Paxton Historical Society, Dauphin Middle 
Paxton Area Senior Citizens, and still delivers Meals on Wheels on a 
regular basis. She is a longtime member of Hope United Presbyterian 
Church in Dauphin, where she enjoys Christian fellowship, Bible study, 
and making Easter and Christmas candy. She enjoys playing pinochle with 
her card club, reading, gardening (especially her beloved roses), 
watching the leaves change in the fall and flowers bloom in the spring, 
and bird watching.
  I join Ellen's friends and family in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day, and in celebrating her life and 
contributions to our great Commonwealth and Country.
  On behalf of Pennsylvania's Tenth Congressional District, I extend 
God's blessings and my heartfelt congratulations to Mrs. Ellen Greaney 
Jacobs on her 100th Birthday.

118,GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2111-4,0,Mr. MOULTON,"  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, last year I attended a rally where the 
father of a gunshot victim spoke, and he talked about all the things 
that he and other people around this country are doing to end senseless 
gun violence.
  Then he turned to the crowd and asked: But what is Congress doing? 
And tens of thousands of Americans, as if they had rehearsed it 
hundreds of times, all said in unison: ``Nothing.''
  But what is Congress doing? Nothing.
  Standing in that crowd was not a proud moment for me, because he is 
right.
  Mr. Speaker, 37 Americans have died from gun violence in my district 
alone in the past 5 years. Gun violence is now the second leading 
killer of young people Nationwide, trailing only car accidents.
  For too long, Congress has done exactly what the crowd said: nothing.
  This week, we are putting forth legislation to enhance background 
checks, but this alone isn't enough. Thoughts and prayers won't cut it. 
Only action saves lives. This is just a start.

121,THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2106,1,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania,"  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
the issue that is facing Americans across the Nation: the opioids 
crisis.
  The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, a comprehensive guide 
published by the Drug Enforcement Administration, indicates that 
illegal drug use continues to rise. It cites Mexican transnational 
criminal organizations as America's greatest enemy in the war against 
drugs. While these criminal organizations are bringing a wide variety 
of illegal drugs across our southern border, I am particularly worried 
about their role in spreading the opioid crisis.
  Thousands of pounds of opioids are smuggled across our southern 
border every year. Just last year, the DEA seized more than 17,000 
pounds of heroin in the United States. About 39 percent of this was 
seized at the southern border.
  Another opioid that has devastated communities across America is 
fentanyl. As we started to understand the scope of the opioid crisis 
facing our Nation, the CDC says doctors started prescribing less and 
less pharmaceutical fentanyl. But fentanyl overdoses remained steady as 
prescription rates dropped, meaning that illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl is one of the main drivers of the opioid crisis.
  Illicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is produced in China and 
Mexico. It is either smuggled into the United States through the mail 
from China or across our southern border from Mexico. In 2017, Customs 
and Border Patrol agents seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl at the 
border. Considering fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than 
morphine, last year's seizures accounted for millions of potential 
overdoses and deaths.
  But it is easy to discuss the amount of illegal drugs that have been 
seized at the border. It is easy to discuss the need for change. The 
hardest part is discussing the human toll that this crisis has taken.
  Madam Speaker, last year more Americans died of a drug overdose than 
in any other recorded year. In 2017, overdoses killed more than 70,000 
Americans, and more than 28,000 of these deaths were related to 
synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.
  Our country is facing a crisis, and action is necessary. That is why 
I was proud to stand with President Trump and support H.J. Res. 31. 
This appropriations bill included provisions that are vital to my 
congressional district and that will bring the fight against opioids to 
the front lines: the southern border.
  Although I was disappointed that my Democratic colleagues didn't 
include more to combat this crisis, I was pleased that it included 
funding for 55 miles of wall on the southern border. Walls work, and we 
need to continue the construction of this wall. This is why President 
Trump's national emergency declaration is necessary.
  But, Madam Speaker, tomorrow House Democrats will bring up a measure 
to block President Trump's emergency declaration, H.J. Res. 46. They 
say the wall is immoral. They say it is cruel. I say we need decisive 
action to fight the opioid crisis, and this is the first step in the 
right direction.
  Since President Carter, there have been 31 national emergencies 
declared. President Clinton declared 6, and President Obama declared 10 
that are still in place. All 31 national emergencies recognized a dire 
threat to the American people and took action. By declaring this 
national emergency, President Trump is taking action against a threat 
that killed 70,000 Americans in 2017 alone.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 46. 
Support our President and save American lives.

who has been named Mr. Amigo 2018 by the Mr. Amigo Association of 
Brownsville, Texas. A Mexican businessman, entrepreneur, and 
philanthropist, Mr. Ayub has enjoyed a distinguished career spanning 
over three decades. Currently, he serves as the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) of Multimedia and Strategic Alliances of America Movil, Director 
of Uno TV, and President of the Instituto TELMEX del Deporte.
  This year, from February 23rd to March 2nd, citizens on both sides of 
the Rio Grande will gather to celebrate the 82nd Annual Charro Days 
Fiesta in Brownsville, Texas and Fiestas Mexicanas in Matamoros, 
Tamaulipas, Mexico. The events of Charro Days commemorate our shared 
history, culture and positive cross-border relationship. The Rio Grande 
binds our city, and there isn't a line or boundary that can eradicate 
the memories and friendships that have flourished over generations.
  Since 1967, as part of the festivities, the Mr. Amigo Association, 
whose mission is to promote the international friendship and goodwill 
between the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico, 
identifies an individual to be Mr. Amigo. The honoree must be a 
distinguished Mexican citizen, who has contributed to the friendship 
and understanding between the U.S. and Mexico and has excelled in their 
profession, exemplifying the highest standards in their professional 
lives.
  Mr. Amigo 2018, Arturo Elias Ayub, hails from Mexico City. Since 
graduating from Anahuac University with a bachelor's degree in business 
management and a graduate certificate in senior business management 
from IPADE Business School in Mexico City, he has contributed 
significantly to the community in which he lives, making him the 
perfect candidate for Mr. Amigo. After serving as CEO at Sociedad 
Comercial Cadena, Ayub held many positions at TELMEX; his work 
developing critical alliances and partnerships beyond the region 
contributed to the international growth of


TELMEX. However, some of his most notable and impactful contributions 
have derived from the work he has spearheaded as CEO of TELMEX Telcel 
Foundation.
  In his position as TELMEX Telcel Foundation CEO, Mr. Ayub has brought 
the resources of the foundation to projects in education, health care, 
natural disaster relief, human development, and sports. An avid soccer 
fan, he translated his passion for the sport into efforts to support 
social justice and increase access to highly-anticipated global 
sporting events to the Americas. Ganar-Ganar magazine, a specialized 
publication about corporate social responsibility, selected TELMEX 
Telcel Foundation as the recipient of the 2013 Social Responsibility 
and Sustainable Award for their work in organizing the 2012 Homeless 
World Cup. Additionally, under Ayub's leadership, Claro Sports 
delivered broadcasting of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi to more 
than 50 television broadcasters in the Americas.
  This year's Mr. Amigo award serves to recognize the positive work Mr. 
Ayub has contributed to our international relationship. It is also a 
message of hope as he continues to help our communities, and in doing 
so, he inspires the next generation of leaders.
  Today we honor Arturo Elias Ayub for his dedication to socioeconomic 
change, business development, and philanthropy. I join Brownsville and 
Matamoros in welcoming Mr. Ayub to Charro Days.

colleagues to support the Never Forget the Heroes: Permanent 
Authorization of the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund Act 
because it is the right thing to do.
  I would like to thank my fellow New Yorkers Carolyn Maloney, Pete 
King, and Jerry Nadler, who have led this fight for years, and Lee 
Zeldin, who will work with me to build bipartisan support amongst the 
freshman class.
  Because 9/11 wasn't just an attack on New York City; Washington, 
D.C.; and a field in western Pennsylvania; 9/11 was an attack on our 
entire country. This was an attack on the United States of America and 
everything that we stand for.
  But what thousands of these 9/11 heroes and their families now face 
is being forgotten because the Victims Compensation Fund, which 
supports these families and these heroes in all 50 States, is running 
out of money and cutting benefits by 50 to 70 percent.
  That is wrong. And if we fail to make this right, shame on us. Shame 
on anyone who says ``never forget'' and then turns their backs and 
pretends this doesn't affect their State or their district or they're 
suddenly fiscally responsible.
  Shame on anyone who says that we can't afford to do this while we 
spend trillions of dollars on bombs in Afghanistan.
  When it comes to doing what is right, it is about keeping our 
promises and honoring those who put their lives on the line and didn't 
ask for anything in return.
  Now is the chance to put action behind the words ``never forget.''

and accomplishments of the National Society of Pershing Rifles, whose 
members and alumni will observe the organization's 125th Anniversary 
during its national convention, March 14 through 16 in Kansas City, 
Missouri.
  In 1891, Second Lieutenant John J. Pershing, then a military 
instructor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, selected a top-tier 
group of cadets to ``promote the highest ideals of the military 
profession,'' among other things, within the Nebraska cadet corps. In 
1894, the group was named The Pershing Rifles, in honor of their 
founder and mentor. Lieutenant Pershing would go on to become Commander 
of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in World War I, and remains 
the only active duty American to be awarded the rank of General of the 
Armies of the United States.
  Since its humble beginnings, the Pershing Rifles have vastly 
expanded, and now numbers more than 600 ROTC cadet and midshipman 
members spread across more than 60 campuses nationwide. Now in its 
125th year, members remain steadfast in their determination to carry on 
the organization's original goal of promoting excellence in the 
military arts.
  The mission of the National Society of Pershing Rifles is to aid in 
the development of successful officers in the Army, Navy and Air Force; 
foster camaraderie and esprit de corps among all three Reserve 
Officers' Training Corps programs; further the purposes, traditions, 
and concepts of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine 
Corps, and give civilians an opportunity to be part of a military 
organization without formal commitment to the military.
  Alumni of the Pershing Rifles have fought with valor and distinction 
as military and naval officers in every American conflict since the 
Spanish-American War. Distinguished alumni include former Secretary of 
State Colin Powell, among many other notable American military, 
political, professional, and cultural leaders.
  Madam Speaker, I am honored to rise and recognize 125 years of 
service to the nation since the formation of the Pershing Rifles. 
Throughout their history, they have strived for excellence in all that 
they do and have clearly lived up to the vision of their founder. I can 
think of no tribute more fitting, to honor the living legacy of General 
of the Armies John J. Pershing and his vision for military and civic 
excellence.

Juan Carlos Salgado, a Houston resident and Good Samaritan who passed 
away on January 13, 2019, in Houston, Texas at the age of 41.
  On the evening of January 13, 2019, Juan Salgado was walking to a 
local market to pick up dinner, but he never made it because while 
crossing Telephone Road near Red Robin Lane, Juan Salgado was struck by 
two cars and died at the scene.
  Madam Speaker, Juan Salgado was not one to draw attention; rather he 
kept to himself and worked hard as a landscaper, and sent his extra 
earnings to his mother in Guerrero, Mexico.
  But there is more to the story of this wonderful man.
  Three weeks before his death, on December 24, 2018, in the early 
morning hours of Christmas Eve, a drunk driver collided with a Houston 
Police Department cruiser that was en route to assist a fellow officer.
  Juan Salgado heard the crash from his apartment and ran toward the 
police vehicle, now in flames.
  Juan Salgado fought to free the two officers, John Daily and Alonzo 
Reid, who were trapped inside, and breaks his right hand when he 
punched through a window to free Officer Reid.
  After freeing both officers and pulling them to safety, Juan Salgado 
left the scene and returned to his familiar and comfortable state of 
obscurity.
  The day after saving Officers Daily and Reid, Juan Salgado was back 
at work as a landscaper.
  This documented hero was an undocumented immigrant.
  But it was not his immigration status that Juan Salgado thought about 
on that fateful Christmas Eve.
  Instead, he saw two human beings who needed assistance and he did not 
hesitate to offer it knowing the danger it posed to him and his 
resident status in the United States.
  Madam Speaker, Juan Salgado put his community above himself and 
because of his selflessness Officers Daily and Reid are alive today.
  I offer my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Juan 
Salgado as they mourn the loss of this unsung hero.

Mathew Hall Lumber, which has been operating in downtown St. Cloud, 
Minnesota, for 130 years.
  Mathew Hall Lumber has been a fixture in the community and a backbone

  Maintaining a business is not an easy task. It involves blood, sweat,

fulfillment, something that generation after generation of the Hall

  One of the reasons why St. Cloud and the great State of Minnesota are 
so incredible is because of hardworking people like the Hall family. By 
maintaining their business in St. Cloud, they brought commerce, jobs, 
and a great product to our community.
  As Simonson Lumber purchases this historic company and the Hall 
family transitions into a new chapter, I speak for all of central 
Minnesota when I say thank you to the Hall family for your great 
contribution to our State and our community.

  Steve retired leaving an incredible legacy. He cultivated a family

19th as a Day of Remembrance for the country and especially for the 
Japanese American community. On that day in 1942, the President of the 
United States signed and issued Executive Order 9066, an action which 
ordered the Secretary of War, ``to prescribe military areas . . . from 
which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, 
the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject 
to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate 
Military Commander may impose in his discretion.''
  Following this executive order, one of the darkest chapters in 
American history began as over 120,000 Japanese Americans throughout 
Washington, Oregon and California were summarily interned in prison 
camps. Those communities, uprooted until the end of World War II, were 
forced to abandon their lives as they left behind homes, jobs, friends 
and loved ones. No due process was granted and throughout the years of 
imprisonment, no one was charged or even convicted of any action that 
would have betrayed the country that they called home. Their only 
``crime'' was that they were of Japanese descent.
  As the Representative of California's 3rd District I am proud to 
recognize our local Japanese American Citizens League Chapter of 
Marysville, California. Over the past few days they have taken the 
opportunity to honor the memory of the hardship that was forced on 
Japanese Americans by engaging the community-at-large to educate their 
neighbors on the importance of defending the civil rights that are due 
every American citizen. I commend their work and aim to carry forward 
that very message.
  Especially at a time when our nation is so divided, it is important 
to spend this time remembering what happened on that day in 1942 and 
the dangers that come from ignoring our most basic civil rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution. I call on my fellow Americans to 
reflect on what took place during those terrible years and to fight to 
protect the rights of all Americans, no matter their heritage or race.

Order tonight as we consider the national debt as a security threat to 
the United States of America.
  I thank Senator David Perdue for his leadership. He introduced a 
concomitant resolution in the Senate. I also thank the more than 50 
Members of this body who are original cosponsors to this resolution.
  I also thank the more than one dozen conservative groups that 
endorsed this resolution and have come to understand that a structural 
deficit that nears a trillion dollars every year, a national debt that 
exceeds $22 trillion, is indeed a threat to our national security.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Roy).",B001302,2019-02-26
141,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,4,Mr. ROY,"  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for his 
leadership on this matter, and I appreciate his leadership very much on 
H. Res. 149, a resolution recognizing the national debt as a threat to 
our national security.
  In February 2000, the total national debt, including 
intragovernmental holdings, was $5.7 trillion. Federal spending as a 
percentage of gross domestic product was 17.5 percent. Today, the total 
national debt now exceeds $22 trillion.
  The last balanced budget was signed into law in 1997, and the 
Congressional Budget Office projects that Federal spending as a 
percentage of GDP is projected to be 20.8 percent this year. In 
February 2018, Congress passed a budget agreement that busted the 
previously established spending caps by almost $300 billion over 2 
years.
  All those numbers don't mean anything to the American people tuning 
in to C-SPAN right now. They are giant numbers. They are really 
difficult for people to understand and comprehend. But we are talking 
about the future of our Nation and what we are leaving to our children.

  We are leaving them with an economy that is anchored by $22 trillion 
in debt that is going to turn to $25, $30 and $40 trillion because, 
this year alone, we are going to have a trillion-dollar deficit, with 
no end in sight.
  We are making it to where our children can't comprehend what freedom 
is like in this country and what opportunity is like in this country 
because they are going to have an economy that is weighted down by this 
body's and the Senate's irresponsibility.
  Nobody in America balances their budgets at home like this. I assure 
my friend from Arizona, our States don't balance their budgets like 
this. Nobody looks at the total number for income you have, then blows 
it by 25 or 30 percent, and then goes to the bank and wonders why they 
might not give you a loan or help you finance a car.
  My concern is that we are allowing this to happen on the backs of our 
men and women in uniform. We are saying that, as a need to defend the 
United States of America and to spend money--which our men and women in 
uniform deserve to have the resources necessary as we ask them to go 
around the globe--we are using that as an excuse to continue to bust 
caps and to bust the limits that we put in place to hold us in check.
  Of that $300 billion that I was talking about the last 2 years, about 
40 percent of that is nondefense discretionary that rode on the back of 
what we are trying to do to help our men and women in uniform have the 
tools they need.
  There used to be an adage of guns and butter. We don't have a choice 
anymore about choosing between guns and butter. Have we cut butter at 
all while we go and increase money for the guns for our men and women 
in uniform? Have we even held it in check? No.
  We have plussed it up and continued to bust the caps, all while we 
know mandatory spending--spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social 
Security--all go up.
  The question I would ask is: When are we going to stop? Is it going 
to take placing a debt clock over the chair of the Speaker? Do we need 
to have something to remind us, sitting here in the body, what we are 
going to be leaving to our children? Because it is our responsibility, 
what we leave behind to our kids.
  It is irresponsible when we look at every bill, every one of these 
little bills that comes across our desk.
  People say, well, why did you vote ``no,'' Mr. Roy? Well, it was just 
another $500,000. It was just another $5 million.
  That is not how you spend at home. It is time that this body gets 
serious about spending restraint. It is time that this body recognize--
as I am very happy that my friend from Arizona has, and I am proud to 
join him in saying that this is an impact on our national security and 
a threat to our national security.
  When we know right now that the interest on our debt is pretty soon 
going to eclipse the amount of spending we are spending at the 
Department of Defense, that is a threat to our national security. We 
can't sustain it.
  When we say now that we are going to spend more money for the tools 
that our men and women need, how are we going to afford to spend on 
those tools in 2030 or 2040 when we are spending more, literally, on 
interest than we are on what they need?
  I am proud to join my friend to make the case here that this is a 
threat to our national security. I call on my colleagues to join us, to 
join this resolution. I call on them to have the same level of resolve 
to limit spending and to make sure that we pass down the greatest 
country to our kids that the world has ever known.",R000614,2019-02-26
142,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,5,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, when the gentleman from Texas talks about 
the crowd-out effect, that is what we see as one of the threats to our 
national security.
  When you look at the spending that is being bloated and plussed-up 
and increased, the ramifications of borrowing more and more money for 
an insatiable appetite to spend the Federal revenues and beyond to the 
tune of almost a trillion dollars a year--and it will continue to rise, 
make no mistake about that, unless we do something--it will ultimately 
crowd out spending for things like the military, spending for things 
like transportation and infrastructure, spending for any discretionary 
item.
  We are on that fast track today, so I appreciate my friend from Texas 
talking and discussing the crowd-out and the impacts on our future and 
our future generations.
  Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Williams).",B001302,2019-02-26
143,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,6,Mr. WILLIAMS,"  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Biggs for leading 
this tonight.


  Madam Speaker, the national debt is the single greatest threat to our 
national security. Since 1997, Congress has failed to do its job and 
balance the budget. Earlier this month, the national debt reached $22 
trillion.
  For this reason, I am proud to cosponsor Congressman   Andy Biggs' 
resolution to recognize the national debt as a threat to national 
security. I commend him for introducing this important resolution in 
the U.S. House of Representatives, and I also commend Senator David 
Perdue for bringing it to the U.S. Senate.
  We must no longer rely on routine debt ceiling increases, nor can we 
risk the devastating effects that a growing deficit will inevitably 
have on our military and our national security agencies.
  In an effort to reduce the deficit and regain responsible spending 
practices, President Trump has laid out his National Security Strategy 
that highlights this critical need to reduce the debt through smart, 
fiscally responsible decisions.
  While it is clear we cannot undo the past, it is also clear that 
Federal spending cannot continue to go unchecked and immediate action 
must be taken. We can no longer defer to future generations to solve 
our problem and to bear this burden.
  I will continue to support legislation that cuts unnecessary spending 
and oppose legislation that recklessly adds to the debt. I ask my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get serious and support this 
important resolution.

  It is time we stopped writing blank checks, and it is time to stop 
risking the national security of the United States of America. It is 
simple: Balance your books.
  In God we trust.",W000816,2019-02-26
144,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,7,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Williams 
from Texas, for his willingness to take a strong stand on this. I am 
particularly impressed by his reference to President Trump's National 
Security Strategy, which specifically mentions a portion of it is to 
bring down our national debt, to try to become a better fiscally 
situated nation.
  That will help our national security, now and in the future. This is 
exactly what President Trump is talking about. That is what we are 
talking about. That is one of the issues that we have before us today.
  I am grateful to my friend, the gentleman from Texas, who brought 
that forward and is supporting this important resolution.
  Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to my friend from Maryland 
(Mr. Harris), the great congressman.",B001302,2019-02-26
145,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,8,Mr. HARRIS,"  Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for 
yielding time.
  I thank the two gentlemen from Texas for introducing the topic to the 
American people. This is something every American should be aware of.
  They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Every American should 
look at a few pictures about our national debt.
  This first picture is a 110-year period going from 1930, before World 
War II, to 2050, just 30 years away. It shows what our national debt 
has looked like as a percent of our economy, and it is pretty striking.
  For the first 90 years of it, there is one huge peak: World War II, a 
world at war. At that time, our debt exceeded the size of our gross 
domestic product, the size of everything produced in the United States. 
Our debt rose to that amount after World War II.
  The Greatest Generation spent the next 30 years paying down our debt 
and growing our economy, so that we had an affordable debt.
  We had a little bit of rise in the 1980s and 1990s, as we defeated 
communism--again, a war situation.
  Then, following 2008 and following the last administration, we have 
skyrocketing debt once again to the point where, within 5 years, we 
will approach the debt we had during World War II, fighting the largest 
war this world has fought.
  Then, by 2048, 30 years from now, actually having a debt that is 150 
percent of everything we make in this country, that is the level we see 
with failing economies, some of the economies like Greece, Italy, the 
ones that have unsustainable debts. We are on a clear path to that.
  Now, let's talk about the size of our national debt. This chart goes 
from 2010. This is just 18 years, starting from 2010 and going to 2028. 
This is the interest payment on our national debt because, Madam 
Speaker, like every American knows, if you borrow money, you have to 
pay interest on it.


  The fact of the matter is that right now, our interest, total 
interest payment, is about $200 billion.
  But, Madam Speaker, every American family knows, every senior who has 
saved for retirement knows that interest rates right now are very low. 
If you go and get a CD, what are you getting, a 1 percent, 2 percent 
return. Those interest rates will return to normal.
  And as the gentleman from Texas mentioned, we are accruing debt at $1 
trillion a year, so that by the time we reach 2028, the interest 
payment on our debt alone, due to the increased size of our debt and 
the increased interest rate is going to approach $1 trillion a year.
  Now, what does that mean?
  Well, Madam Speaker, there are a lot of things that the government 
funds. Those of you who are interested in the safety of Social 
Security, of Medicare and Medicaid, of Federal pensions, they know that 
we are approaching a zero sum game. We can't keep this debt going 
forever.
  In fact, this final chart I am going to show is 10 years, starting 
now, it shows the percent spending of GDP, so relative to our economy, 
what our net interest on our debt is; and then other things, like 
Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, things that we think 
are important, defense. The yellow line, the defense budget, 
nondefense, discretionary spending, all these are relatively constant. 
All of them are going to be crowded out by net interest on the debt.
  Madam Speaker, Americans understand, you can't borrow forever. You 
can't do it on your cars; you can't do it on your houses; you can't do 
it on your credit cards; and we can't do it here in Congress anymore. 
This threatens our security, when, in 5 years, we will pay more 
interest on our national debt than we pay defending this country. We 
can't do it.
  Congress has to get its act together, clean up its act, and get our 
budget in balance.",H001052,2019-02-26
146,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,9,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland, and I 
appreciate his focusing on the interest, because he is right. In just a 
few short years, we will be spending more of our budget on interest 
than we do on defense; and then a couple of years after that, more on 
our interest than we spend on Medicare.
  Think about that. Think about where we are headed because of our 
profligate ways.
  In the first chart he showed, I was struck, as I remembered growing 
up in the Cold War era.
  Madam Speaker, I think those of us who grew up in the Cold War era 
remember that contest between us and the former Soviet Union and the 
amount of money spent by both sides. It is dwarfed by the spending that 
we are embarking on today as a percent of our GDP. That is where we 
are. That is where we have come. So it continues to be a problem in so 
many ways and on so many levels.
  Madam Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Buck).",B001302,2019-02-26
147,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,10,Mr. BUCK,"  Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding, 
and I thank him for his leadership on this important issue.
  Madam Speaker, we have $22 trillion of debt, over $22 trillion of 
debt now. We are accumulating debt at approximately $1 trillion a year. 
America is financially bankrupt, and if we continue to place this 
burden on our children and grandchildren, we are also morally bankrupt.
  We are threatening our ability to react to world affairs, our ability 
to deal with the dynamic threats that we face in this world, not just 
land, not just sea, not just air, but space also.
  We need to balance the budget, but it requires us to make difficult 
decisions today, to ensure a prosperous future. And it requires us to 
make significant cuts to our discretionary spending.
  One of the amazing, unique characteristics of this place, of 
Congress, is that for some reason, we make a distinction between 
discretionary spending and mandatory spending.


  My grandchildren don't care if they have to pay back a debt that was 
created by mandatory spending or a debt that was created by 
discretionary spending. They don't care. A dollar is a dollar to them, 
and it should be to us, and we should take control of mandatory 
spending, just as we take control of discretionary spending.
  Since I was elected to Congress, I have fought hard against our 
country's out-of-control spending, and I have advocated for a balanced 
budget amendment to the Constitution that would force Congress to pass 
a balanced budget every year.
  For the economic well-being of our country, I am proud to join my 
colleagues in cosponsoring this important resolution, and I would like 
to thank my dear friend and colleague, Mr. Biggs, for recognizing our 
country's serious spending problem before it's too late.",B001297,2019-02-26

and I appreciate him raising that important issue, that it is an 
oddity, isn't it, in Congress, that somehow we segregate money. We 
segregate money and say, oh, well, this money doesn't matter so much. 
But it becomes fungible when you are looking at the accumulation of 
debt that we are heaping upon our future generations.
  I appreciate the gentleman bringing that to our attention and 
reminding us, and I would just say, I appreciate his voting record, 
because I have watched it closely, and he is a man of his word when he 
says he has been fighting to balance the budget and reduce our deficit 
since he got here, because his voting record is actually true to that, 
and I appreciate that very much.
  Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Cline).",B001302,2019-02-26
149,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,12,Mr. CLINE,"  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona 
for the time, and thank him for bringing this issue to the forefront.
  Madam Speaker, I am distressed by the lack of numbers in the Chamber 
right now because this truly is the greatest threat to the security of 
this Nation that we face.
  When I ran for office last fall, I promised the citizens of 
Virginia's Sixth Congressional District that I would reintroduce 4 
words to Washington: ``We can't afford it.'' These are four words that 
have been needed to have been repeated over the last 22 years, as the 
last time a Federal budget with a surplus was signed into law was 1997.

  In Virginia, where I served in the House of Delegates until last 
year, we are required to balance our budget each year. And because we 
have placed a priority on fiscal responsibility, Virginia is frequently 
listed among the best states in which to do business.
  In contrast, the Federal Government has an outstanding public debt of 
more than $22 trillion. Every year, since 1997, Congress has failed to 
maintain a fiscally responsible budget and, instead, has relied too 
much on raising the debt ceiling.
  Because of this practice, on August 5, 2011, the credit rating of the 
United States was reduced by Standard & Poor's from AAA to AA+, and has 
remained at that level ever since.
  Virginia, through its fiscal responsibility, has maintained its AAA 
bond rating, one of only a few States to have that honor.
  Not only is the current practice of not passing a balanced budget 
fiscally irresponsible, it poses a threat to our national security. As 
part of his National Security Strategy, President Trump has highlighted 
the need to reduce the national debt through fiscal responsibility, and 
I commend him for it.
  In September 2011, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
Michael Mullen warned: ``I believe the single biggest threat to our 
national security is debt.'' And at that time, our national debt was 
close to $15 trillion. Now, almost 10 years later, our national debt 
has increased by $7 trillion, a 46 percent increase.
  Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand with Congressman Biggs, my fellow 
cosponsors, and a bipartisan group of national security leaders, in 
support of this resolution:
  Recognizing that the national debt is, indeed, a threat to the 
national security of the United States;
  Recognizing that deficits are unsustainable, irresponsible, and 
dangerous; and
  Committing Congress to restoring regular order in the appropriations 
process and addressing the fiscal crisis faced by the United States. 
The future of our great republic depends on it.",C001118,2019-02-26
150,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,13,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Cline), for his comments and his efforts and his willingness to stand 
on this important issue and recognizing--and promising to people and 
responding to that promise; because I can tell you, when I first 
considered even running for Congress, one of the things that motivated 
me was this horrific debt, which I have watched explode even more since 
I got here; not because I am here, but in spite of my efforts.
  So, today, we are preparing to introduce our resolution, which will 
be later this week, Senator Perdue, his cosponsors, my 50 original 
cosponsors--more than 50 original cosponsors. And we recognize that, as 
of today, the national debt is more than $22 trillion. You have heard 
that. Can you hear it enough without taking action?
  The resulting total interest expense for the fiscal year 2019 is $192 
billion. $192 billion. Interest does not sleep. It doesn't take a 
holiday; it doesn't take a vacation. Interest accumulates without 
ceasing until you pay your debt.
  Our national debt as a percentage of GDP is 104 percent. The last 
time a Federal budget was balanced and was signed was 1997.
  Our total Federal tax receipts for fiscal year 2018 were $3.329 
trillion. But somehow--and we all know how--our Federal outlays totaled 
$4.1 trillion, with a deficit of $780 billion. And we know how. We know 
how that happened. We look to each other in this body.
  Since the last time Congress balanced the Federal budget in 1997, 
Congress has failed to maintain a fiscally-responsible budget and has 
relied on raising the debt ceiling. How many times have we raised the 
debt ceiling? It is almost more than you can count.
  Congress failed to pass a balanced budget for fiscal year 2019 and 
failed to restore regular order to the legislative process by not 
allowing Representatives to offer and debate amendments. When we have 
regular order, it permits the House to separately debate and adopt all 
appropriation bills in a timely fashion and facilitates congressional 
oversight on Federal spending.
  Estimates are Medicare will run out of money in 2026, Social Security 
in 2034.
  As my friend from Virginia, Mr. Cline, said: Congress' 
ineffectiveness has caused the U.S. credit rating from Standard & 
Poor's to drop from AAA to AA+. Without a targeted effort to balance 
the Federal budget, our credit will surely continue to fall.
  President Trump's National Security Strategy highlights the need to 
reduce the national debt through fiscal responsibility.
  Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned that: ``Any nation 
that can't keep its fiscal house in order eventually cannot maintain 
its military power.''
  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that: ``Our 
continued plunge into debt is unsustainable and represents a dire 
future threat to our economy and to our national security.''
  Former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck 
Hagel warned: ``Increase in the debt will, in the absence of a 
comprehensive budget that addresses both entitlements and revenues, 
force even deeper reductions in our national security capabilities.''
  And former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen 
warned: ``I believe the single biggest threat to our national security 
is debt.''
  And so what must the House do?
  First, we have to recognize that the national debt is, indeed, a 
threat to our national security. We must realize that deficits are 
unsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous.


  We must restore regular order in the appropriations process, and we 
must commit to addressing the fiscal crisis faced by the United States.
  I mentioned it before, but when you are spending a pot of money and 
you have limited resources, regardless of how great those resources 
are--I mean, we have had record tax revenue for the last 14 months, 
record revenue, more than any time in the history of the United States 
of America, and we still outspend that revenue.


  As we do so, we have to borrow money, because we have created a 
structural deficit. So, foundationally, we put ourselves in a position 
where we have to borrow money; and when you have to borrow money, you 
have to pay interest. As you have to borrow more money, which we do, 
you are going to start crowding out what you can spend those limited 
resources on.
  Who holds our debt? One of the biggest holders of our debt is also 
one of our greatest potential adversaries, and that is China. China has 
been, for the last 25 years, expanding their military, building a blue-
water navy, expanding their capacity for rockets and missiles, and also 
taking in our debt.
  This places us at risk if we are ever in a conflict, which I pray we 
never are. I hope we never are. But if we are in a conflict with an 
adversary who holds significant amounts of our national debt, we are at 
risk. And you have to acknowledge that.
  What has helped us out so far is the fact that the U.S. dollar is the 
international medium of exchange in international transactions, 
economic transactions. If we were to lose that, the ability to borrow 
funds to sustain our unsustainable spending would go away. And I bring 
that back to China.
  China has ambitions to make its own currency a regional currency of 
exchange. They would like to replace the United States dollar as the 
international medium of exchange as well.
  What else is an actual physical problem when you have the kind of 
debt and deficit spending that we have is that you cannot pay to 
replace and maintain your internal infrastructure, and we see that 
today. Bridges, roads, airports, all of these need maintenance. They 
need upkeep. They need expansion. We need new roads. We need new 
highways, but we can't pay for it, because we are going to be in a 
position of being overextended. That places us at risk, because you do 
need internal infrastructure.
  Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to my good friend, the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).",B001302,2019-02-26
151,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,14,Mr. YOHO,"  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. 
Biggs from Arizona, for yielding. This is such an important topic that 
we are talking about, national debt.
  I remember when I came to Congress in 2013, Admiral Mullen said that 
the biggest threat to America is our national debt. Hillary Clinton, 
Secretary of State at the time, said she agreed with that. One of the 
few times I have agreed with Mrs. Clinton.
  But national debt today is $22 trillion. When I came into Congress, 
it was $14.5 trillion. When President Reagan left office, it was about 
$2.5 trillion. It doesn't matter who is in the White House. Our debt is 
going up until this body, Congress, addresses our debt.
  If you do a pie chart of our debt, 71 percent of our debt is 
mandatory spending, 29 percent is discretionary. Discretionary was 
described to me as the money we have left over at the end of the month 
after we pay all of our bills. That is discretionary.
  The interesting thing is, in 1964, those numbers were reversed. 
Mandatory spending was 29 percent, discretionary was 71 percent. So we 
were a cash-rich Nation. We could do things. We could do a space 
program. We could do the infrastructure bills that we did that this 
Nation needed.
  Today, that is flipped around to where 71 percent of every dollar 
this government takes in is already spent. We don't vote on that in 
Congress. Those are things that happen without us. The only things we 
vote and we shut the government down on is that 29 percent.
  If we do not address our mandatory spending, mandatory spending will 
address us as a Nation.
  I was on an interview, and they said, well, President Obama doesn't 
want to mess with mandatory spending, which is Social Security, 
Medicare, Medicaid, interest on our debt, retirement programs for our 
Federal employees. And I reminded the interviewer, and they said this 
about President Trump: He doesn't want to deal with mandatory spending.
  I said: I understand that. But either this President or the next 
President deals with mandatory spending or mandatory spending will 
dictate to this Nation what we have to cut, and those are called 
austerity measures.
  All you have to do is look at Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, Greece, 
where they had mandatory austerity measures where programs were cut, 
and they were cut by other governments that controlled their debt.
  Today, about 30 percent of our debt is controlled by foreign nations, 
the other 70 percent, the American taxpayer owns, but it would be 
tragic to allow us in this body to allow another nation to say: You 
have got to get rid of that program.
  That is unconscionable. It is irresponsible of us. And if we do not 
deal with that debt, that debt will deal with us.
  Madam Speaker, this is something I appreciate Mr. Biggs standing up 
and having this Special Order on. This is something we talk about 
repeatedly in our district. We have town halls on this.
  When you look at the discretionary spending, that is the stuff that 
runs all of government outside of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, 
the retirement programs. That means the Department of Defense. That 
means the Department of Education, Justice, the Department of Homeland 
Security. All the research money that goes into our research 
universities comes out of the discretionary funding of government.
  I am telling you, as a Nation, if we do not address this, this Nation 
will not survive, and history will repeat itself from great countries 
that have lasted for a period of time. They have always come to a 
demise, and it was because they haven't paid attention to the things 
that are the very basic.

  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague for bringing this up. This 
is something that repeatedly--if you look at this Congress, the 
Democrats have been in charge of the House since January 2 or 3. We 
don't have a budget. We haven't addressed anything dealing with debt. 
But they have spent a lot of time dealing with President Trump and 
trying to remove him from office and finding out reasons why he 
shouldn't be the President. Madam Speaker, we as Americans need to come 
together and deal with the debt, and I appreciate the gentleman's 
efforts.",Y000065,2019-02-26
152,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,15,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for taking 
time to come down and give us his insight on this monumental problem.
  One of the things that he talked about, Madam Speaker, is that we 
have got to take care of our processes, our procedures. He is right. It 
doesn't matter whether it is Republican or Democrat; our processes have 
been broken.
  I can't even begin to tell you. I have been here a little over 2 
years. I bet you we have done a dozen and a half short-term spending 
bills, continuing resolutions. I bet it is that many. It seems to me 
like that many. I think we did three government shutdowns last year. I 
don't know when the next one is going to be. It wouldn't surprise me if 
it was 2 weeks from now, whenever it is. But the reason we do those 
things is because our budget process fails.
  I remember sitting in a meeting and I heard someone say: We have got 
a 10-year budget plan to balance our budget. And I heard somebody else 
stand up and say: Well, I have been here 10 years. Ten years ago, I was 
told we had a 10-year budget plan, so we ought to be up to snuff. We 
ought to be balanced by now, because it is 10 years since that 10-year 
budget plan.
  I think it was Mr. Yoho who said that.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back to Mr. Yoho.",B001302,2019-02-26
153,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,16,Mr. YOHO,"  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, because 
I came here and they said: Well, don't worry about this, because this 
will balance in 5 years or this will balance in 10 years.
  And I laugh, but I shouldn't be laughing. We should be crying, 
because here I am, 7 years, and guess what: It will balance in 10 
years.
  It will not balance. And, again, it is up to us, the Members of the 
House and the Senate, because we control the purse strings. But we have 
done a terrible job at it, and it goes back to leadership on both 
sides.
  This is something that should not be a partisan issue. This is 
something that should be an American issue, because America is at stake 
here. It is not a Republican Party or a Democratic Party. We don't 
serve a party is what I tell people in my district, and I am sure you 
do the same thing. I serve a Nation, and that Nation is the greatest 
Nation on Earth. If we don't get our


fiscal house in order, this Nation will not be the Nation it is.
  So, again, I don't think it will balance in 10 years. It won't 
balance in 20 years unless we change the dynamics, and they need to 
change now.",Y000065,2019-02-26
154,RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DEBT AS THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2222-3,17,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.
  Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time from the gentleman from Florida, 
when we look at that and the promises constantly, this is getting to my 
point: The process needs to get back to regular order. It needs to get 
back to 12 individual bills--this is what we talked about--12 
individual bills that go through a process where there is debate; there 
are amendments; there is discussion; and there is accountability.
  Nothing provides more accountability than bills that have single 
subjects; nothing provides more transparency than bills that have 
single subjects; and nothing allows the American people to see what we 
are doing in Congress like single subjects.
  So when you take 12 subjects, which are your budget bills, and you 
combine 3 or 4 of them into a minibus and 6 or 7 into an omnibus, and 
you say vote on these things--usually we are given just a short period 
of time to read those things and analyze them anyway; usually they come 
in under some closed rule or some highly structured rule--well, you are 
preventing a couple of things:
  Number one, we are not going to get to a balanced budget because, 
ultimately, what you are also preventing is accountability, because 
when the American people can see how you voted in a single area on a 
single issue, they know whether they agree with you or not. They know 
whether you should be doing that, and they will let you know. They give 
you the feedback. That is the accountability that we need if we are 
going to balance this budget over time and correct our course.
  Now, there is an economic theory called path dependence. Sometimes it 
is called increasing returns. Kenneth Arrow wrote a lot about this, and 
what it boils down to is this: It is an analysis, really, of why 
decisionmakers make suboptimum decisions and then persist on the course 
even after they know it is a suboptimum decision.
  Well, what typically happens is regimes and institutions are built 
up. There is feedback, and people will persist on that because they are 
building up regimes and institutions; and, ultimately, they have 
propelled themselves so far down, they are what we call locked in. To 
exit that path, the cost is so high that they don't want to exit that 
suboptimal path and move to a more optimal path.
  But I am here to tell you tonight that as long as we stay on this 
suboptimal path where we don't have these 12 budget bills, we don't get 
back to regular order in budgeting, as long as we do CRs and then claim 
that we have done a normal budgeting path when we have created 
cromnibus bills or omnibus bills or minibus bills, we are not going to 
be able to exit the path that we are on.
  If we are going to sustain this Nation, we are going to need to exit 
the path that we are on and move to a more optimal path.


  That is really what this resolution is about. It is encouraging 
people from both sides of the aisle. I am not blaming one side or the 
other. I am just saying that if we are going to get this done, 
everybody in this House has to look internally. Everybody in this House 
needs to say: What are we doing with our process? Everybody needs to 
recognize that if we continue on this path, at some point there is no 
more path to run down.
  We just heard from a series of speakers that the numbers go up and, 
at some point, you reach a tipping point, and that tipping point says 
you cannot go forward. I would rather we move over to a suboptimal path 
now and pay that price, which is typically a short-term, corrective 
price. In the scheme of things, it may take longer than just a short-
term, but we have to move over because, if we don't, our choices are 
taken away from us.
  I will tell you that if we would have gotten on the path 2 years ago, 
we would have had more choices and more options. Every day we go 
further down this path, the fewer options we have until the end. Mr. 
Yoho is correct, and all of my friends who have spoken tonight were 
correct, and the more than 50 cosponsors here, they are all correct: If 
we don't do something, it will be imposed upon us.
  If it is imposed upon us, we won't have control. We will not be able 
to handle this in a way where we hurt the fewest people, where we can 
feather the landing as much as possible, where we can maintain our 
economic status, where people can still find jobs, and where people can 
achieve the American Dream that they perceive that they want to 
achieve. Those things get taken away from us because, ultimately, this 
country is built on individual freedom and individual accountability.
  If we have to take that horrible measure of receiving something like 
our debts being called in, or we can't find lenders, or the cost of our 
loans--imagine if the cost of our debt today would just move up a 
couple of points--imagine what that would look like. If we can't do 
this of our own volition, we will be subject to someone else's will and 
the very essence of the American Dream--individual freedom and 
individual accountability--will go away. And why? Because that 
accountability will be foisted upon us by coercive forces.
  Madam Speaker, I conclude tonight with gratitude to the 50-some-odd 
men and women who have signed on to this resolution. I implore all in 
this body to join myself, to join me, to join Senator Perdue and those 
who have signed on and sponsored a companion resolution in the Senate, 
and let's make the hard choices today so that we might preserve the 
freedoms for our children and grandchildren.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Colorado and our Nation lost a fierce and fearless advocate, Carrie Ann 
Lucas of Windsor, Colorado.
  A mother, an activist, and an attorney, Carrie practiced family law 
to prevent discrimination against parents with disabilities. She 
adopted four children, and her accomplishments centered on her 
dedication to them. All her children have significant disabilities, and 
Carrie always ensured that they were loved, respected, and supported in 
their individual hopes and dreams.
  Carrie devoted so much to ensuring her wisdom never stayed with just 
her but was shared throughout the disability rights community, the 
legal world, and our Nation. She spoke out strongly and protested each 
day for the rights of people with disabilities to comprehensive 
healthcare with dignity and respect.
  It is a permanent scar on our Nation that Carrie was lost to the 
refusal of an insurance company to cover one particular medication, 
which led to escalating health issues and, eventually, her premature 
death.
  Carrie's activism knew only the bounds of freedom and of justice. She 
was ceaselessly bold, brave, and selfless.
  My thoughts are with her family, and I pray that this body will gain 
some of the bravery that never faltered in her and use it as an 
inspiration to ensure that no American goes without healthcare--ever.
  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the obituary of Carrie Ann 
Lucas.

                      Obituary for Carrie A. Lucas

       The disability community lost one of its fiercest advocates 
     on 2/24/19. Carrie Ann Lucas, a disability rights attorney 
     who pioneered representation for parents with disabilities, 
     died after an arbitrary denial from an insurance company 
     caused a plethora of health problems, exacerbating her 
     disabilities and eventually leading to her premature death. 
     She was 47 years old.
       Carrie Ann Lucas is known around the state and the country 
     for her strong advocacy.
       Carrie Ann grew up in Windsor, Colorado, and had several 
     careers including being a teacher, ordained minister and 
     legal assistant before becoming an attorney. Carrie graduated 
     from Whitworth College in 1994, traveled and taught in 
     Saipan, and then returned to the states to attend the Iliff 
     School of Theology. She received a Master's of Divinity with 
     Justice and Peace Concentration from Iliff in 1999, but 
     during her time there, became increasingly involved in 
     disability advocacy. After she graduated, she started working 
     as an advocate and later legal assistant for the Colorado 
     Cross-Disability Coalition, investigating, preparing, and 
     monitoring disability rights cases and providing informal 
     advocacy on a wide range of topics. While there, she was 
     granted a full scholarship as a Chancellor's Scholar at the 
     University of Denver School of Law.
       Following her graduation from law school in 2005, she was 
     awarded a prestigious Equal Justice Works fellowship to 
     create a program to combat discrimination that impacts 
     parenting for parents with disabilities. This program, 
     initially started within the Colorado Cross-Disability 
     Coalition, spun off to be Disabled Parents Rights, one of the 
     only organizations in the country devoted to this issue. She 
     also became a national expert and trainer on the rights of 
     parents with disabilities and, through her legal advocacy, 
     secured decisions upholding and promoting those rights here 
     in Colorado. Most recently she was recruited by the Colorado 
     Office of Respondent Parents Counsel to help set up a program 
     to train other lawyers around the state to replicate the sort 
     of impact she was making.
       In addition to these professional activities, Ms. Lucas was 
     an advocate with the disability rights groups ADAPT and Not 
     Dead Yet, speaking, teaching, writing, testifying, and 
     protesting on disability justice and the rights of people 
     with disabilities to healthcare and respect. She was also a 
     talented photographer and cook. Carrie Ann was an activist at 
     heart. She graduated from EMERGE, ran for Windsor City 
     Council in 2017, and was planning on additional political 
     activity. She was chair of Colorado Democrats with 
     Disabilities for the past several years. She was a member of 
     the ADAPT group that protested in Cory Gardner's office and 
     got arrested to help save the Affordable Care Act in 2017, 
     particularly Medicaid. She served on the Board of Directors 
     of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. She was 
     active with Not Dead Yet and fought hard against physician 
     assisted suicide and the notion that life with a disability 
     is not worth living. She demonstrated every day how amazing 
     life with a disability can be. She was given the 
     Intersectionality Award from The Civil Rights Education and 
     Enforcement Center in 2016. She was a leader in passing HB 
     18-1104 which changed Colorado law to make sure that 
     disability was no longer a reason to remove a child from a 
     parental home. There is much, much more.
       Carrie became a lawyer to practice family law after lived 
     experience of discrimination against parents with 
     disabilities firsthand. In 1998 fostered and later adopted 
     her oldest daughter, Heather Lucas. Heather has significant 
     developmental disabilities and was languishing in another 
     state. She fostered and was preparing to adopt a second 
     child, but that was disrupted due to prejudice against 
     parents with disabilities. Where most people might be upset 
     and feel helpless, Carrie Ann was furious and went to law 
     school to represent parents with disabilities.
       Carrie adopted three more children over the years, Adrianne 
     Lucas, Azisa Lucas and Anthony Lucas. All of her 
     accomplishments centered on her dedication to her children 
     and her role as a mother. All of her children have 
     significant disabilities and Carrie Ann always made sure that 
     they were not only educated and included in their 
     communities, but that they were loved, respected, and 
     supported in their individual hopes and dreams.
       Carrie had a severe neuromuscular disease, a rare form of 
     muscular dystrophy. She relied on a power wheelchair, and had 
     used a ventilator for years. However, her death was premature 
     and caused by inappropriate and brutal cost containment 
     procedures of an insurance company. Because Carrie Ann worked 
     for the state, she had use state insurance which was primary 
     ahead of her Medicare and Medicaid. In January of 2018 she 
     got a cold which turned into a trach and lung infection. Her 
     insurance company UnitedHealthcare, refused to pay for the 
     one specific inhaled antibiotic that she really needed. She 
     had to take a less effective drug and had a bad reaction to 
     that drug. This created a cascade of problems, loss of 
     function (including her speech). United Healthcare's attempt 
     to save $2,000 cost over $1 million in health care costs over 
     the past year. This includes numerous hospitalizations, 
     always involving the Intensive Care Unit which is par for the 
     course for ventilator users.
       Carrie Ann had hoped to spend a lot of time in 2019 using 
     her tragedy to work to fix our broken health care system. Her 
     blog www.disabilitypride.com provides more details. For all 
     intents and purposes a shero of our community was murdered in 
     the name of cost containment. This is why we MUST fight these 
     measures with all we have. Insurance companies and government 
     programs must not be allowed to deny people what they need. 
     Just last month she was having to ration her insulin for her 
     type 1 diabetes because of the same insurance company and how 
     impossible it is to work between private insurance and 
     Medicare and Medicaid. This is a great example of why people 
     with disabilities should not be forced into insurance or 
     health plans and why we need Medicaid as the primary health 
     delivery system for this country.
       In addition to her four children, Carrie Arm is survived by 
     her parents Phil and Lee Lucas, sister Courtney Lucas, 
     brother Eric Gover, her niece Danielle Mann, nephews Cody 
     Mann, Gavin and Colin Lucas, Danielle's partner Aaron Boone 
     and their sons Izaiah, Kyal and Eli, Gavin's wife Kathleen 
     and their daughter Emily and Colin's son Dakota. She is 
     predeceased by a sister, Kelli Mann and her grandparents. She 
     is also survived by her partner Dr. Kimberley Jackson, a CCDC 
     Board member and activist in the disability community. She 
     will be missed by a wide circle of friends and colleagues 
     throughout the country.

162,SETTING STRAIGHT THE RECORD,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2108,0,The SPEAKER pro tempore,"  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from

163,SETTING STRAIGHT THE RECORD,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2108,1,Mr. GREEN of Texas,"  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, and still I rise.
  And I rise today with love of country in my heart and a belief that 
the record has to be set straight.
  The record has to always reflect the truth, and there is a truth that 
is being obscured.
  I want to set the record straight because there seems to be a belief 
that, if you have committed acts of bigotry, if you have been a racist, 
if you have been engaged in homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, there 
seems to be a belief that, if you can do one thing, somehow that thing 
will eradicate and eliminate all of the bigotry that you have 
perpetrated.
  I rise to correct the record because I want the record to show that 
at least one person came to the floor of this Congress and made it 
clear that, yes, unemployment may be low for African Americans--yes, it 
may be low--but it is still twice that of Anglo Americans, generally 
speaking.
  Yes, you may have signed a bill to deal with some aspects of criminal 
justice in a just way, and that is appreciated. But there is still more 
work to be done. But notwithstanding the fact that there is more work 
to be done, it is still appreciated.
  But the record has to be set straight, and here is what the record 
should show: that that does not eliminate the bigotry emanating from 
the Presidency.
  Eliminating bigotry does not occur because you signed one bill. It 
does not occur because unemployment is low. It does not occur.
  If you want to have the record reflect that you have done something 
to atone for your bigotry, then you have to do something a little bit 
more than to simply sign a bill.
  And I am not saying to you that an apology is in order. I say to 
people: Tell the truth. Just tell the truth.
  Say: I was wrong when I instituted a policy that separated babies 
from their mothers that emanates the type of bigotry that we don't 
condone in this country.
  Say: I was wrong when I said there were some good people among those 
who were the racists, the bigots, the xenophobes and homophobes in 
Charlottesville.
  Say: I was wrong when I said that you don't have to be so kind when 
you are taking persons into your care, custody, and control and you are 
part of the constabulary, you are part of the policing force in this 
country.

  Just say you were wrong if you want to atone. Signing bills won't do 
it. Going to church won't do it.
  Asking forgiveness will cause you to be forgiven. And I will forgive 
you, but that doesn't mean that you are no longer going to be 
sanctioned for your bigotry.
  I want to thank those who have stood and made their points clear as 
it relates to bigotry.
  I am listening to these morning programs now. They are all talking 
about bigotry emanating from the Presidency, not necessarily in those 
words. They are talking about the racism that the President 
perpetrates.
  I appreciate what they are saying, but we have got to do more than 
talk about it. We cannot allow a President to remain in office who has 
engaged in this kind of bigoted conduct.
  It is time for us to take a stand here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives.
  There were no fine people in Charlottesville. You ought not separate 
babies from their mothers. You ought not have policies that would 
condone bigotry and encourage others to engage in it.
  I believe that we have a duty to take a vote, and at some point in 
the near future we will take another vote, notwithstanding the Mueller 
report.",G000553,2019-02-26

165,HONORING SAMUEL D. ROBERTS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2219-4,0,Mr. PAYNE,"  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Samuel D. Roberts for 
his lifetime of service to the people of New York.
  Sam's career began with General Motors, where he was a union worker 
who served as chairman of the UAW Local 465 Education and Civil Rights 
Committees. While at GM, Sam served five terms as an Onondaga County 
legislator. Then the people of New York State's 128th Assembly District 
sent him to represent them in Albany.
  After 5 years in the State assembly, Governor Andrew Cuomo tapped Sam 
to serve as commissioner of New York's Office of Temporary and 
Disability Assistance, a $5.4 billion office that oversees more than 
2,000 workers.
  Sam recently retired from government to serve as a special advisor to 
SUNY Oswego's president.
  Throughout it all, Sam has kept community first. He has created 
positive change that will last for generations both in Onondaga County 
and throughout the State of New York.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Samuel 
D. Roberts, a pioneering community leader.

166,REVERSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2112,0,Mrs. KIRKPATRICK,"  Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the President has set a dangerous 
precedent by crying wolf in the name of national emergency.
  I represent parts of the southern Arizona border. My community knows 
the border. We know the further away from the border you live, the more 
fictional the border narrative.
  Border crossings are down to one-fifth of what they were in 2000, and 
apprehensions are at their lowest level in more than four decades. 
Those are facts.
  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's 
declaration makes America less safe. The President is stealing billions 
from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our 
troops have the essential training and resources they need to keep the 
American people safe.
  We will not sit by when the President abuses his power. I am 
confident that my Republican colleagues will regret supporting this 
false national emergency when there is a Democrat in the White House.

167,INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CLEMENCY HOME RULE ACT,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE210-3,0,Ms. NORTON,"  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I introduce the District of 
Columbia Clemency Home Rule Act, a bill that would give the District of 
Columbia exclusive authority, like the states and territories, to grant 
clemency to offenders prosecuted under its local laws.
  While District law appears to give the mayor authority to grant 
clemency (D.C. Code 1-301.76), it is the opinion of the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) that the president, and not the mayor, has the authority 
to grant clemency for most offenses prosecuted under D.C. law, 
particularly felonies prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney in the D.C. 
Superior Court. Under current practice, clemency petitions for D.C. 
convictions, like federal convictions, are submitted to the DOJ for the 
president's consideration.
  Whether or not DOJ's view is correct, my bill would remove all doubt 
that the District, and not the president, has the authority to issue 
clemency for local offenses. The District, like the states and 
territories, should have full control of its local criminal justice 
system, the most basic responsibility of local government. Since the 
D.C. Council has the authority to enact local laws, District officials 
are in the best position to grant clemency for local law convictions. 
My bill would provide clemency authority to the District government and 
would give D.C. the discretion to establish its own clemency system.
  This bill is an important step in establishing further autonomy for 
the District in its own local affairs. I urge my colleagues to support 
this measure.

Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 144, providing for 
consideration of H.J. Res. 46, relating to a national emergency 
declared by the President on February 15, 2019.
  The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a closed 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure.
  Additionally, the rule provides that the provisions of section 202 of 
the National Emergencies Act shall not apply during the remainder of 
the 116th Congress to a joint resolution terminating the national 
emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019. This 
provision was included to avoid privileged legislative action on 
redundant resolutions.
  Mr. Speaker, today we must stand up for democracy; we must stand up 
for the rule of law; and, most importantly, we must stand up for the 
United States Constitution, the Constitution that we took an oath to 
defend when we were sworn into office.
  Mr. Speaker, the Constitution we swore to defend granted Congress the 
power of the purse. That means Congress decides how we spend the 
American people's hard-earned money.
  Congress spoke when we passed, and President Trump signed, a spending 
bill that granted him $1.4 billion for fencing along the border. Now 
President Trump is acting like a dictator by ignoring Congress and 
declaring a national emergency. As a result, billions of taxpayer 
dollars would be taken from high-priority military construction 
projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness, 
and quality of life necessary to keep the American people safe.
  Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I 
have visited countries where the rule of law takes a backseat to the 
whims of their Presidents. Just look at Venezuela, where Nicolas Maduro 
has removed every single obstacle to his power.
  When he objected to the rulings of the judges, he ended their terms 
early and replaced them with his political allies. When the 
democratically elected congress didn't agree with him, he created a new 
congress filled with his supporters.
  Last year, he even banned prominent opposition leaders from running 
into the Presidential election. He has demonized the press and even 
took CNN en Espanol off the air. Last night, he detained one of 
America's journalists, Jorge Ramos, of Univision.
  Fighting with judges, manipulating elections, attacking the press. 
Mr. Speaker, does any of this sound familiar?
  Now you have a situation where food is so scarce that the average 
Venezuelan has lost 24 pounds in the last year and more than 3 million 
have fled the country. The Maduro presidency, now that is a true 
national emergency for the people of Venezuela.


  The collapse of democratic institutions is also happening in 
Nicaragua and Guatemala. The President of Guatemala and his allies in 
congress are taking the country down the same path, removing every 
check on their power. They have expelled the international prosecutors 
who dared to investigate them.
  And just as Guatemala's Government has tried to undermine and 
delegitimize the police and prosecutors who are investigating, 
President Trump has called Robert Mueller's investigation a ``witch 
hunt'' and denigrated the brave men and women of the FBI.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this President--or any President, 
Republican or Democrat--to take us down the same path as Venezuela, 
Guatemala, and Nicaragua, all to build a wasteful and ineffective wall 
along our southern border.
  These women and children coming from Central America do not represent 
a national emergency. That is why 58 former national security 
officials, both Republicans and Democrats, issued a statement saying 
there is ``no factual basis'' for the President's emergency.
  Our call to duty today is to protect, to defend our Constitution. We 
will vote, and we will see how many in this body have that same respect 
for the rule of law.


  Mr. Speaker, I urge our Republican colleagues to join us in this 
effort. It is not too late for my colleagues across the aisle to tell 
the President that this is wrong, that the Constitution that we swore 
an oath to uphold really matters.
  We stand here today to stop this power grab of our own democracy. A 
``yes'' vote will affirm our democracy. A ``no'' vote further erodes 
the trust in our democracy and, again, expands executive power.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on which side they stand.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",T000474,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I want you to know it flatters both me and the 
gentlewoman from California that you have made it your habit to be down 
here during Rules Committee time. It is good to know that you respect 
what we do upstairs as much as the members of the committee do.
  I always enjoy coming down for the Rules Committee debate, because it 
is the only debate on all of Capitol Hill where the Reading Clerk reads 
every single word of the bill that we are about to consider. 
Ordinarily, we waive that, but the rules don't let you waive it. You 
have to read the rule so folks will understand what is happening today.
  I happened to time the Reading Clerk today. I didn't put him up to 
anything special. He read as he always does. It took him 1 minute and 6 
seconds to read the resolution that is before us.
  I heard my friend from California talk about the important 
constitutional questions that are here before us today. I heard my 
friend from California equate our President to discredited despots 
around the globe and how we must stand up to prevent that behavior here 
in America. I heard my colleagues who took to the floor this morning 
for 1 minutes be sanctioned by the Chair and advised to cease engaging 
in arguments of personality and attacks against our President.
  One minute and 6 seconds it took to read the resolution before us 
today, Mr. Speaker, and that is 1 minute and 6 seconds longer than this 
resolution has been considered in total in every committee throughout 
this Capitol.
  I want to say that again. You heard my colleague talk about how 
critically important this resolution of disapproval is as it relates to 
our constitutional powers. You heard it described as a power grab 
equivalent to those of discredited despots. And we haven't talked about 
it at all in this Chamber. In committees, not one witness has 
testified.
  One minute and 6 seconds is how much we have invested in these 
nationally important matters.
  I listened, Mr. Speaker, as you cautioned Member after Member to 
cease engaging in personal attacks on the President during their 1 
minutes this morning. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that that is exactly 
what we are doing here today.
  If you want to have a debate about Article I and Article II powers 
and how we ought to retrieve the power that has slid down Pennsylvania 
Avenue through administration after administration after 
administration, I am not just your willing partner, I am your 
enthusiastic partner and passionate advocate. But that is not the bill 
we have before us today. It is not the debate we are going to have 
today.
  This is another in a long string of measures that have been brought 
to the floor of this House that could have been brought in a bipartisan 
way. I don't mean one Republican; I don't mean two Republicans; I mean 
the majority of Democrats and the majority of Republicans standing 
together to speak with one voice on behalf of the American people. But 
time and time again, we are missing that opportunity.
  This isn't a constitutional issue today, Mr. Speaker, though you 
would not know that, because we have not had any witnesses testify. 
This is a legislative issue before us today.
  There is, in fact, a National Emergencies Act that allows the 
President to do extraordinary things if he or she decides there is a 
national emergency. That is not unconstitutional. Congress passed the 
National Emergencies Act; the President signed the National Emergencies 
Act. Perhaps the Supreme Court one day will decide that was an 
unconstitutional delegation of power by the Congress, but the Congress 
delegated that power in the National Emergencies Act.
  The way we talk about this issue, Mr. Speaker, you would think this 
is the first time you and I have seen this in the few years we have 
been in Congress. Of course, you and I know that is nonsense.
  There are 31 other national emergency declarations in effect today--
31 other national emergency declarations. National emergency 
declarations from the Obama administration are still active today.
  If we are so concerned about Article I and Article II power grabs, 
perhaps these emergency declarations that have been on the books since 
the last administration, Congress should deal with those affirmatively 
here on the floor.
  There are national emergency declarations still in effect from the 
Bush administration. There are national emergencies still in effect 
from the Clinton administration. Mr. Speaker, there are national 
emergencies still in effect from the Carter administration. This House 
has made not a single effort to draw back that power from 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue.
  Those are legitimate questions. Those are important questions. Those 
are things that bring us together as the people's representatives in 
this House, not bills designed just to poke a stick at a President who 
has real passion and real conviction about issues of real importance.
  Do you know what is in this resolution today, Mr. Speaker, what is in 
this disapproval resolution today, that will make a difference on the 
border in terms of ending human trafficking? Not one thing.
  Do you know what is in this resolution today that, if we come 
together to pass, will make a difference in terms of drug trafficking 
on the border? Not one thing.

  What about if we come together to pass this resolution today for the 
very serious issue of weapons trafficking across our border? Do you 
know what we will do today to fix that? Not one thing.
  Victims of sexual assault as they are being trafficked into this 
country, do you know what we are going to do to fix that today? Not one 
thing.
  Do you know how many Dreamers are going to have their hopes realized 
today with a pathway to permanency here in the United States of 
America? Not one.
  Man, we are good at bringing issues that are designed to poke each 
other in the eye. We are so good at bringing issues designed to try to 
embarrass one and boost another. But I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
we are not so great with actually solving real problems.
  For the first time in my congressional career just last Congress, Mr. 
Speaker, we brought a bill to the floor that would have provided 
permanency


for our Dreamers and that would have provided solutions on our border 
for human trafficking, for weapons trafficking, and for drug 
trafficking. You know how many Democratic votes we got on that bill, 
Mr. Speaker? Not one.
  Now, to be fair, it wasn't one bill; it was two bills. Folks said, 
hey, if this one is not the right one, let's bring another one. Maybe 
this is going to bring people together.
  Do you know how many votes we got on the second bill, Mr. Speaker, 
from the other side of the aisle? Not one. The only bills that have 
come to the floor to provide a pathway for Dreamers in my 8 years in 
Congress, and we got not one vote from the other side the aisle.
  Is that because the other side of the aisle doesn't believe in those 
solutions? No, that is not why. It is because the other side of the 
aisle, in its wisdom, deemed that to be a resolution not designed to 
support the Dreamers, but designed to divide. I disagree with that 
conclusion, but that is the conclusion that was made. Thus, the only 
opportunity in a decade we have had to support Dreamers, not one 
Democrat stood up and said yes.
  I call that a failed opportunity, and I am not interested in figuring 
out who is to blame for that failed opportunity.
  This is a failed opportunity today, too, Mr. Speaker. Sadly, it is 
another in a series of failed opportunities here in 2019.
  I believe my colleagues are going to see through the divisiveness of 
this resolution, through the charade of constitutionalism right down to 
the very core of partisanism that underlies this resolution.
  But just remember, 1 minute and 6 seconds, Mr. Speaker. Before I took 
to the microphone today, 1 minute and 6 seconds from the Reading Clerk 
is all the time this new Congress has dedicated to an issue that you 
are going to hear from my colleagues again and again is one of critical 
national importance, international importance, constitutional 
importance. How can those things be true?

as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I can think of many other things that we could be 
talking about that truly, truly, truly call out and scream out for a 
national emergency.
  Homelessness in our communities: Thousands of people in our 
communities sleep on a street, under a bridge, children sleeping in 
vehicles every single night.
  I think about the opioid epidemic, and how many of our families are 
simply immune to the issues around drug abuse and how addiction 
overcomes them?
  I think about last year around Christmastime when 800,000 of our 
Federal workers were going without a paycheck and went without a 
paycheck for 35 days. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
could not find 1 minute and 6 seconds to give them a paycheck, to open 
up the Federal Government, to do their duty.
  Instead, in the Rules Committee, we took up an emergency order on 
labeling of cheese curds. They found that to be more important than the 
lives and the families of 800,000 Federal workers.

California for her astuteness, and, certainly, the manager of this 
legislation, and our friends on the other side of the aisle.
  Mr. Speaker, I simply want to try to craft the importance of H.J. 
Res. 46 that we will ultimately be debating today. As an original 
cosponsor, I was quick to try to bring order and to recognize the 
importance of the Constitution.
  Clearly, the statute might be interpreted to be used in a reckless 
manner. But it is precise in that it deals with the necessity of 
building military construction and other matters in the course of war 
that are an emergency.
  It might even cover rising gun violence, the fact that we have more 
guns in the United States than we have citizens.
  It might be that if there was a pending war on the southern border, 
one might determine that that is the case.
  It might be that, in 2001, the first sense of terrorism came when an 
individual crossed the northern border to attack the United States. If 
that had continued with throngs of terrorists coming across the 
northern border, the President then might have declared a national 
emergency.
  But we do not have that, Mr. Speaker. What we have is a person's 
desire.
  We understand that the apprehensions at the southern border have 
actually gone down. The combined 521,000 apprehensions for border and 
Customs agents for fiscal year 2018 was 32,288 apprehensions fewer.
  Those who are coming across the border in the last 6 to 8 months are 
coming across as mothers and children fleeing the catastrophe of 
bloodshed in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. These are people 
desperate for help. They are coming through legal ports of entry.
  How do I know that? I have stood and watched them come. I have spoken 
to a mother whose baby was 45 days old. She had birthed on her road 
here, not because she just wanted a vacation, but because they had 
committed to decapitating her if she did not leave town immediately, 
meaning leave one of the countries. It was my plea that got her to be 
able to go to a hospital. I held little Roger in my hands, who is 9 
months old. He had been separated at the border from his family.
  These are the issues that are being addressed at the border. There is 
no catastrophe.
  Let me be very clear, as my friends always cite illegal immigration, 
I want to make sure that any criminal, no matter who they are, who does 
any injury to anyone in the United States, count me as standing on the 
side of bringing that person to justice. But that is not what is 
happening at the border.


  Therefore, I would ask the administration to attend themselves to the 
Constitution, to recognize the difficulty or the wrongness of 
distorting the purposes of the United States Congress, the House, that 
has the purse strings by calling it a national emergency. My God, if we 
were to have one, would this Nation even understand how to implement it 
because they are hearing it being declared in a very foolish way?
  I conclude by simply saying that 58 people in national security, Mr. 
Speaker--58 of them--have indicated this is wrongheaded and jeopardizes 
our national security.

2,000 illegal aliens were apprehended by Federal agents for homicides 
committed on American soil. Worse yet, roughly 31,000 Americans die 
each year from heroin and cocaine overdoses, 90 percent of which floods 
across America's porous southern border. Hence, we can expect at least 
33,000 dead Americans each year until America secures our porous 
southern border.
  For perspective, the 9/11 terrorist attacks killed roughly 3,000 
people. In response, America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan at a cost of 
trillions of dollars and, roughly, 7,000 lost military personnel lives.
  Saving Americans should be a bipartisan issue, yet here we are. 
Republicans seek to prevent another 33,000 dead Americans this year, 
while partisan Democrats seek to embarrass and stop President Trump 
from securing America's porous southern border and saving American 
lives.
  For emphasis, no national emergency in history has been prompted by 
more dead Americans than President Trump's national emergency 
declaration. As such, I support President Trump's national emergency 
declaration and will vote accordingly.
  Mr. Speaker, how many dead Americans does it take for open border 
advocates to support border security? How much American blood must be 
on guilty hands before Congress recognizes the national emergency we 
face at America's southern border? America's military protects the 
borders of, and lives in, South Korea, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, many 
other countries, and Europe.


  I thank President Trump, as Commander in Chief, for understanding 
that America, and Americans, deserve no less protection.
  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by noting that dead Americans, Americans 
killed by illegal aliens as a consequence of porous borders, had 
dreams, too. We, as a Congress, should remember and honor those dreams 
and act accordingly and protect this national emergency to protect 
American lives by securing our porous southern border.",B001274,2019-02-26

that the number one trading partner for California and Texas is Mexico, 
a friendly country. For Central America, we are standing up for our 
responsibility to uphold democracy in the Northern Triangle, to address 
the root cause of migration. That is where our focus should be.
  Do we need an immigration reform package that brings 11 million 
people out of the shadows? Absolutely. These are the 11 million people 
who our agricultural partners depend on to deliver fresh food to our 
table. But we are not doing that here. What we are doing here, what the 
President has chosen to do, is political theater, political theater for 
2020.
  In essence, a vote against this resolution means a vote against the 
families of the military people who are depending on us to provide 
infrastructure, schools for their children to learn, and quality 
housing.
  Do Democrats think and believe that fortifying our borders is 
important? Absolutely. We have committed billions of dollars to ensure 
that we stop the narcotrafficking that happens at our ports of entry. 
That is where it is happening.
  We need to work together on these issues, not relinquish our 
responsibilities, our legislative responsibility, and the power of the 
purse that we hold.

  Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to urge Members to vote against this 
ill-advised resolution to disallow the President's declaration for 
emergency funding on the border.
  In 2006, I was in Congress, and Congress voted for the Secure Fence 
Act. With the Secure Fence Act, under President Bush, 400 miles of 
border fence was built. Under President Obama, an additional little 
over 100 miles was built. Now President Trump has asked for a little 
over 200 miles to be built to provide security for America.
  Now, is it a national emergency? I will tell you, I had as my guest 
to the State of the Union someone who is referred to as an angel dad. 
This is an individual who went and put on the uniform and fought for 
his country in Iraq. While he was there, unfortunately, his wife got 
ill and died, and he came home. Now he is a single dad, and he is 
taking care of his only child, a daughter. That daughter, 
unfortunately, was hit by a car on the street that was driven by 
someone who did not have legal status to be in this country.
  Several months later, Chris came to me and said: Congressman, I did 
my job. I put on the uniform. I went and defended my country. Mr. 
Congressman, I did my job, and if you had been doing yours, my daughter 
would be here today.
  President Trump has taken that mantle very seriously. It is his goal, 
it is his requirement, to defend our country at the southern border, 
and the President will do just that.

  If you read the history of emergency declarations in the past, you 
will find a number of them. Some, perhaps, you might agree with; some, 
perhaps, you might disagree with. But since the founding of our 
country, it has been recognized that it has been the purview under 
Article II powers for the President of the United States to be able to 
exercise that emergency declaration. It was codified in the 1970s in a 
law that is now the one that brings this forward today, that brings 
forward this resolution of disapproval.
  If you don't like the law that allows the President to declare an 
emergency, change the law. You are the majority. You control the Rules 
Committee. Change the law.
  What is interesting about this is, last night, in the Rules 
Committee, when we considered Mr. Castro's resolution, we didn't 
consider it. We didn't have a single witness. Mr. Castro, I felt like 
sending Capitol Police out to find him. There was no one there to 
testify in favor of his resolution. The Rules Committee seemed 
perfectly agreeable to accepting this without any debate whatsoever.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote against this ill-advised motion 
to disallow the President's declaration of an emergency. Allow the 
President to do the job he was elected to do and secure the southern 
border.",B001248,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, if we, indeed, defeat the previous question, we will 
allow consideration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act.
  I introduced this legislation because the Constitution clearly states 
that all persons born in this country are entitled to life, liberty, 
and equal protection under the law. The Constitution does not put age 
limits on those who are entitled to life.
  I am horrified, Mr. Speaker, that many in the United States Senate, 
many Democrats, flagrantly violated the United States Constitution last 
night and voted down the Born-Alive Act, embracing, in fact, 
infanticide.
  Pro-abortion politicians used to say life begins at birth. Now it is 
more unclear than ever when they believe that life actually begins or 
whether they even believe that living and breathing human beings should 
be protected under the law.
  I would like to commend three Democrats, in fact--Senators Bob Casey, 
Joe Manchin, and Doug Jones--who defended the basic rights of newborn 
children and voted for my legislation last evening in the United States 
Senate.
  I introduced this legislation because it is just common sense. I am 
shocked that there are prominent American legislators who believe in 
denying babies lifesaving medical care when they are born.
  As a mother, a grandmother, a legislator, and an advocate who came to 
Congress to serve as a voice for the voiceless, I believe that life 
begins at conception and that it is wrong to kill a child no matter how 
many weeks old he or she may be. But I am grieved to find that I now 
must defend something that I never thought we would have to fight for: 
lifesaving care for babies born alive.


  In response to radical legislators who are promoting not just late-
term abortions but infanticide, it is essential that we come together 
to protect children.


  So today, I am here to ask--no, Mr. Speaker, I am here to implore--my 
colleagues to right the wrong that the Senate has committed and defeat 
the previous question, and at least allow the debate to support H.R. 
962, the Born-Alive Act here in the people's House.
  Mr. Speaker, this should not be a partisan issue. Congress must never 
stop fighting to ensure that every single newborn baby in the United 
States of America receives lifesaving care, no matter their sex or 
their race or ethnicity or whether or not they are wanted and cuddled 
and wrapped into that first warm hug that they deserve.
  The Born-Alive Act is the simplest vote any of us can take: Do you 
support babies receiving lifesaving care after they are born, or would 
you deny these innocent children that care and allow them to be left to 
die and be discarded?
  This is bipartisan legislation, Mr. Speaker. Last year, six of my 
Democratic colleagues joined me in voting for the Born-Alive Act.
  I hope that we will bring this bill to the floor for debate so that 
many more of my colleagues can go on the record and vote to stand with 
America's mothers and children.

yielding and, also, for her tremendous leadership on the House Rules

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and 
Congressman Castro's resolution to stop President Trump's fake, so-
called national emergency at the border.
  Let me be clear: This emergency declaration is a blatant attempt to 
subvert the Constitution and get around Congress' sole power of the 
purse. Let me remind you also, that this is a democracy, not a 
dictatorship. We have three branches of government, not one, and 
Congress has the power of the purse strings.
  Also, let's make one thing clear: There is no emergency at the 
border. The only crisis at the border is the humanitarian crisis that 
the President created himself through his hateful family separation 
policies.
  And instead of protecting our national security, this President is 
doing just the opposite: He is stealing money from military 
construction projects to try to build an unauthorized wall.
  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I can tell you that we 
will not allow this President to circumvent our authority at any cost. 
I am proud to cosponsor this resolution to put a strong check on this 
President and terminate his ability to declare this fake national 
emergency.
  I call on my Republican colleagues and the Senate to vote ``yes'' on 
this rule and ``yes'' on this resolution. It is past time to stand up

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act. If we defeat the previous question, we will 
bring up the text of this important piece of legislation to defend 
life.
  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am mystified as to why the majority is loath 
to actually make this vote. Indeed, they have been doing backflips to 
avoid allowing the House to actually go on record on this important 
issue.
  This bill is a commonsense approach to protecting our Nation's most 
vulnerable. It amends the Federal Criminal Code simply to require that 
any doctor present when a child is born alive following an abortion or 
attempted abortion must provide the child with the same degree of care 
as he or she would provide any other child. The bill also requires that 
any such child is immediately admitted to a hospital.
  Mr. Speaker, as we have seen in recent weeks, many people in elected 
positions do not appear to appreciate the need to provide for 
protections for our most vulnerable Americans newly born, but it is 
clear that current law fails to provide adequate protections for 
newborns who survive an abortion attempt. This bill draws a sorely 
needed bright line of protection around abortion survivors and requires 
that they be given the same level of care as any other premature 
infant.

  As stewards of the law of this country, Mr. Speaker, protecting the 
most vulnerable, including the unborn, should be one of Congress' basic 
responsibilities.
  Since entering Congress, I have made the protection of life one of my 
highest priorities. I believe that all Members should have that same 
priority. Today, we can take a step toward making this a reality by 
defeating the previous question and bringing up the Born-Alive 
Survivors Protection Act for a vote.

I rise in strong support of the rule and resolution to rescind the 
President's unnecessary and unconstitutional national emergency 
declaration.
  Mr. Speaker, having visited the southern border multiple times in the 
past year, including just last month when I met with Customs and Border 
Patrol officials, I can say without any question that there is no 
emergency at the border.
  We as a nation face serious challenges in reforming our immigration 
system and stemming the flow of illegal drugs into our country. 
However, a border wall will do nothing to address these challenges.
  Research consistently shows that the vast majority of illegal drugs 
coming to this country through the border are smuggled through legal 
ports of entry, and most illegal immigration is as a result of people 
overstaying their visas.
  All this declaration will do is divert $6.7 billion away from 
critical military construction projects and drug interdiction 
operations, hampering our Nation's military readiness and making it 
more difficult to address real challenges. These are funds that would 
be better used on projects to improve and build new military family 
housing or make improvements to National Guard and Reserve facilities 
throughout our country.
  Mr. Speaker, we should not be spending a single day wasting time on 
this ridiculous, misguided executive order from the President. There is 
no emergency at the border. Illegal border crossings are at a 40-year 
low. The President's own intelligence community, when they did their 
worldwide threat assessment, testified and didn't mention the southern 
border--and certainly did not identify it as an emergency.
  Instead of wasting time on this, we should be getting back to the 
work of driving down prescription drug prices, focusing on rebuilding 
the infrastructure of our country, and passing H.R. 1 to get government 
working again for the people of this country and not the special 
interests.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to approve the rule, vote for the 
resolution, and end the President's unconstitutional, excessive use of 
power attempting to circumvent the will of the American people.
  The American people decide through their elected Members of Congress 
how their tax money will be spent. The President is attempting to throw 
the Constitution away, circumventing that process, and we cannot permit 
that to happen.

  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support of the underlying rule, but 
also in opposition to the action that is being proposed by my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
  But I will join them in one sentiment: I do believe there is an 
emergency crisis at the border. I do believe that the President, given 
the years and decades of delegation of authority from Congress to the 
President's Office, has the authority to take the action that he is 
taking in regards to this proposed issue at the border.
  But where I agree with my colleagues on the other side is that the 
Presidential authority is something that we need to take into 
consideration and reform going forward.
  It should not be because it is President Trump; it should not be 
because it was President Obama; but each and every time the executive 
branch uses its authority and reaches into areas that go beyond the 
constitutional limits of that office, we should stand together as 
Members of Congress to assert our authority.
  That is why, Mr. Speaker, there is a bipartisan group of us working 
over the last few weeks, and we intend to drop a resolution sometime 
soon, that will amend the National Emergencies Act to make it clear 
that, when there is a national emergency declared in this country, that 
we speak as one nation, one body here in Congress with the President.
  We have to affirmatively take a vote here in Congress, go on record, 
and not hide any longer as Members of Congress. We should be held 
accountable by putting our voting cards in that box to stand before the 
American people.
  When a national emergency is declared by the President, we have to 
vote whether or not, guaranteed vote, to see if that is something we 
agree with the President on. That is a fundamental reform that will 
reestablish Article I of the Constitution.
  And to my colleagues who are up today: Where were you when President 
Obama overreached in his executive office?
  So I ask you to remember those days and stand with us who are looking 
to take on the root cause of this problem and reestablish the 
congressional authority that rightfully is contained under the 
Constitution.",R000585,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying

  We should be absolutely clear: There is no crisis at our border. In

This is a fake emergency being used as a pretext for Donald Trump to 
build a monument to hate on our southern border.
  But this is more than that. This administration's actions would do 
violence to our Constitution, undermine our separation of powers, and 
set a terrible precedent for the future. Every single Member of 
Congress, regardless of party, needs to stand up and make their voice 
heard.
  To all my Republican colleagues who so frequently extolled the 
Constitution's virtues, I say to you: Make your voice heard today. Now

stand up for Congress' constitutionally vested powers of the purse.

  Mr. Speaker, you just heard an impassioned plea from my friends on 
the other side of the aisle about the important constitutional 
questions that are before us today, about how the President's emergency 
declaration violated those sacred constitutional principles.
  Candidly, I don't know if my colleagues are right or not because we 
have not had one legal expert come to talk about the National 
Emergencies Act. Most of us were not in Congress when it passed several 
decades ago, but it is a delegation of authority from Congress to the 
executive.


  You just heard my friend from New York come to the well and say, 
listen, we have been working in a bipartisan way to offer a bill to 
rein in those authorities. I think that is important work. I think that 
is work that we ought to all be able to agree on. We should be doing 
that work first.
  I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, the sum total of all of the time 
this institution has spent working on these important constitutional 
questions is the 1 minute and 6 seconds our Reading Clerk Josef spent 
reading us the resolution today.
  We will vote on this rule today. We will vote on the underlying 
disapproval today, having never had the committees of jurisdiction hold 
even a single hearing.
  Now, lest you think there is just no time in the calendar, this 
resolution is referred to the Transportation Committee on which I sit. 
In fact, I had to leave a Transportation Committee hearing in order to 
come up here to do the rule today.
  We are working on the Green New Deal in the Transportation Committee 
today. We are working on electric vehicles and how to reduce carbon 
emissions across the country. Now, I am not saying that is not 
important work, but I have not heard one of my colleagues talk about 
the dearth of electric vehicles and how that is threatening the future 
of our land.
  I have heard my colleagues talk about this important constitutional 
question that this disapproval brings before us, and, yet, there was 
not one hearing on it.
  Now, lest you think, Mr. Speaker, that if we deal with this today, we 
won't deal with it again. No. We are going to have some hearings on 
this resolution. When? Later in the week after it passes.
  Now, I don't know if that is a pattern that we are going to get into. 
I hope that it is not. Having had no hearings and no witnesses testify 
on this issue, we are going to have an Appropriation Subcommittee 
hearing later this week to talk about exactly these issues, where the 
money is coming from, what the impact of that is, and whether or not it 
is wise.
  We are going to have a hearing later this week in the Judiciary 
Committee talking about the National Emergencies Act, and whether or 
not it permits this kind of activity, and what kind of changes ought to 
be made.
  This resolution will have already been considered. This vote will 
have already been taken, but we will eventually get around to having 
thoughtful conversation about this.
  Mr. Speaker, I close where I began. There is more that unites us as 
Americans than divides us. And even in politics, there is more that 
unites this institution than divides us. Making sure that 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue only is exercising those authorities delegated to 
it by either the Constitution or this Congress, is a shared value.
  But if you listen to the debate here on the floor, from the Speaker's 
chair, you had to caution our colleagues against engaging in attacks of 
personality against the President. We heard debate, not of thoughtful 
constitutional principles, but of hateful administration policies.
  Mr. Speaker, I will tell my friends, I don't believe those words, 
those actions, or those efforts are going to bring us one bit closer to 
the shared values that we have in this institution.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the rule today and vote 
against the previous question so that we can bring up a bill that will 
save lives. This bill will save not one life; will prevent not one drug 
trafficker from coming into the country; will protect not one migrant 
family. It will do nothing, Mr. Speaker, to solve real problems that 
face this country.
  If we defeat the previous question, we can at least take a 
commonsense step toward doing exactly that. Vote ``no'' on this rule, 
vote ``no'' on the previous question, and let's commit ourselves to 
finding a way to come together.
  If you believe there is more that divides us than unites us, these 
first 45 days of this session have been just perfect for you. But if 
you believe, as I do, that we can do better, let today be the end of 
the partisan attacks. Let today be the end of bringing bills to the 
floor designed to make a point instead of make a difference, and let's 
make tomorrow better.

  Mr. Speaker, fact-checking the President is not an attack against the 
President. The facts matter. As a matter of fact, the President himself 
at his press conference said: ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd 
rather do it much faster.''
  What does he mean by that? Last year, Republicans gave him $25 
billion if they read the bill, but I actually brought it to their 
attention on the floor that the bill actually read $75 billion that 
they were allocating for a border wall. The facts didn't matter then 
for one side of the aisle.
  The President himself said it. ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd 
rather do it much faster.'' That is not an emergency. I was a 911 
emergency dispatcher for 17.5 years. I can cite many examples of what 
an emergency is. Building a wall much faster is not an emergency. That 
is political theater. That is political posturing for 2020.
  Where is the President stealing this money from? Certainly, he is not 
getting it from Mexico as he promised. Mexico said ``no.'' The 
President is stealing $2.5 billion that Congress approved to combat 
illegal drug activities around the world.
  I know that my colleagues believe that fighting international drug 
organizations is important. I know this because I traveled with 
Republicans and Democrats to the jungles in South America. We talked 
about eradication of narcotrafficking.
  What about the $3.6 billion that the President is stealing from 
military construction? A study earlier this year found that 16 percent 
of military families had a positive view of their base housing. That 
means 55 percent had a negative one.
  Many families reported unsafe conditions, including lead-based paint, 
rampant mold, exposed asbestos, faulty electrical wiring, vermin 
infestations, and gas leaks. Is that not an emergency? Is that not 
worthy of the bipartisan vote that we took to allocate that money so 
that they can make those fixes?
  I know my Republican colleagues support military families. I know 
that because I have traveled with them to Afghanistan. I have traveled 
with them to other countries. I know that this is wrong. This so-called 
national emergency is wrong, and I know my colleagues know that this is 
wrong too. This is undemocratic. This puts us at the cusp of a 
constitutional crisis.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the previous question 
and the rule.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in 
defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency 
issued by the President on February 15, 2019.
  The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the 
petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the 
United States.
  As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the 
Committee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on 
numerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently 
that there is no national emergency or national security crisis that 
justifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or 
compels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I 
to check and balance the Executive Branch.
  The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national 
emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely 
correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in 
Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that 
``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''
  In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling 
data available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's 
national emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.
  The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every 
region of the country, by every income group and education category.
  National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous 
in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not 
constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former 
Republican senators and Members of Congress.
  They understand that after failing to convince the American people or 
Congress to pay for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion 
dollar concrete wall, the President has now embarked on a course of 
conduct that is deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks 
and balances wisely established by the Framers and which has served 
this nation and the world so well for nearly 250 years.
  Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the 
constitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate 
11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency 
declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and 
negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the 
Congress of the United States.
  The Congress will not tolerate this.
  Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming 
evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false 
information regarding the state of our southern border.
  Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.
  Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people 
leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging 
population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic 
decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.
  Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a 
slight increase from 2017.
  The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs 
agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the 
553,378 apprehensions in 2016.
  To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border 
Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in 
2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.
  In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are 
parents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme 
poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
  But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border 
seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest 
since the 1970s.
  The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve 
the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts 
agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are 
smuggled through legal ports of entry.
  The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living 
in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
  These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas, 
Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.
  Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration 
enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other 
enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US 
Marshals, and Secret Service.
  The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than 
59,000 personnel.
  CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more 
than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of 
19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.
  Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active-
duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the 
estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of 
National Guard to the border.
  Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress, 
a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border 
wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has 
appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.
  The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress 
to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes 
Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military 
construction.
  Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of 
these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly 
and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.
  In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,'' 
but has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''
  Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national 
security officials including former secretaries of state, defense 
secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a 
statement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the 
President's emergency declaration.
  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's 
declaration makes America less safe.
  The President is stealing billions from high-priority military 
construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential 
training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American 
people safe, directly undermining America's national security.
  The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive 
power of the purse,


and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, 
violating our Founders' vision for America.
  Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision 
transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism, 
constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.
  That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members 
of Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46 
and uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist 
efforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching 
president.
  To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the 
King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold the rule of law and the 
Constitution, and reject the President's power grab; I urge a 
resounding YES vote on H.J. Res. 46.",T000474,2019-02-26

205,ADDRESSING THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2111-6,0,Mr. LEVIN of California,"  Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark a 
monumental occasion for this Chamber. For the first time in decades, 
this body will take up major legislation to address the epidemic of gun 
violence in this country. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8, bipartisan 
legislation to require a background check on every gun sale or 
transfer.
  I know the vast majority of my constituents support this step, 
including Renae Greg, a woman from Carlsbad, who was simply trying to 
enjoy a country concert when she was forced to dodge bullets at a Las 
Vegas shooting.
  I know that Lonna Leghart, a constituent from Vista, supports this 
commonsense legislation. Her sister Kimberly, tragically, lost her life 
as a result of gun violence in my district.
  It is on their behalf and on behalf of all Americans who are impacted 
by daily gun violence in this country that I will support H.R. 8, and I 
hope all of my colleagues will stand with us.
  There is so much more that we need to do to fully address the 
epidemic of gun violence, but today it is a huge step for Renae, Lonna, 
and families across this country.

206,TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL CAROL A. TIMMONS,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE212-2,0,Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER,"  Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of my 
colleagues Senator Tom Carper and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, to 
honor and congratulate Major General Carol Timmons for a lifetime of 
dedicated service to our country.
  After graduating from William Penn High School in 1977, Timmons 
enrolled in college and enlisted in the Delaware National Guard. With a 
childhood dream of becoming an airplane pilot, her career in flight 
would begin that very summer on a C-130 airplane in Savanah, Georgia. 
Despite her love of airplanes, Air Force rules prevented women from 
flying combat-mission planes, like the C-130. Due to these unfair 
regulations, she joined the Army National Guard in 1980 and would learn 
to fly Army helicopters, like the UH-1 Huey.
  Undeterred and committed to her dream, Timmons joined the Air Force 
Reserves where she flew noncombat support missions. She soon realized 
her dream as federal laws ended the discriminatory prohibition on women 
flying in combat missions, and during Operation Desert Storm, then-
Captain Timmons would become one of the first women to fly in combat. 
Following that operation, her career would come full circle as she 
rejoined the Delaware National Guard--flying the same C-130s she first 
learned to operate.
  On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier General Timmons would make history 
by becoming the Delaware Air National Guard's first female commander, 
and again on February 1, 2017, when she was promoted to the rank of 
Major General and named Adjunct General of the Delaware National 
Guard--the Governor's chief military advisor commanding 1,500 soldiers 
and 1,100 airmen.
  During her storied 42-year career, she earned a Bronze Star for her 
service in Afghanistan and has flown over 5,200 hours in the cockpit, 
including 400 combat hours during contingencies, spanning Operations 
Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint Guard, Iraqi 
Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and Inherent Resolve. She served on the 
National Guard's Joint Diversity Executive Council and the Air Force 
Reserve Policy Committee. She has received numerous honors, including 
induction into the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame and the Delaware 
Women's Hall of Fame.
  By refusing to compromise on her dream, Timmons broke down barriers, 
blazed trails, and inspired women to let nothing stand in their way in 
service to our nation. I join Senator Carper and Senator Coons in 
thanking Major General Carol Timmons for her over four decades of 
service to our state and country, and we wish her the very best.

pastor of Shekinah Glory Cathedral located in Plant City, Florida, and 
who most gracefully offered this morning's opening prayer. He is also 
my brother and my friend.
  Pastor Shaw's dedication to family, friends, and community serves as 
an example to many. His over 15 years of hard work in the ministry 
without expecting anything in return embodies the definition of unity 
and the best of the human spirit.
  As I listened to his prayer, I thought of the many distinguished men 
and women who have stood in this Chamber, at that podium, preaching the 
importance of unity in our great Nation.
  One such man was Abraham Lincoln, who said: ``A house divided against 
itself cannot stand.''
  In our fast-moving society, it is easy to focus on those things that 
divide us over those things that bring us together. It is why, Mr. 
Speaker, I stand here today calling for greater unity among all who 
serve in this Chamber, among the American people and for the thousands 
of communities across our great land.
  Only together can we withstand adversity, not just as individuals, 
but as a Nation. This does not mean that we will always agree. It does 
mean we should seek unity in those disagreements.
  We do not need to see eye to eye to walk hand in hand.

must stand united through our differences.

  President Trump's decision to declare a national emergency at the 
southern border to siphon funds for his border wall is an 
unconstitutional, grotesque abuse of power.
  An emergency declaration is not a last-ditch maneuver to employ when 
all negotiation attempts have failed. The House of Representatives has 
rejected the President's border wall. The Senate has rejected the 
border wall. And the American people have rejected this useless wall.
  The President does not get to override Congress in a raucous temper 
tantrum over his inability to broker a deal. The National Emergencies 
Act was enacted in 1976 to expedite the allocation of resources for 
real emergencies to save American lives and mitigate damage caused by 
natural disasters and acts of terror. It was not fashioned to allow a 
President to deny the will of Congress and the American people.
  Both Democrats and Republicans alike should be very concerned about 
the ramifications of this unprecedented executive action. It is a 
direct threat to the balance of power that our country was built upon 
and a violation of our Nation's Constitution.
  There is also no factual basis for the emergency declaration. 
Immigration from the southern border has significantly decreased in the 
last 10 years. Any attempts to characterize the border as a crisis zone 
are flagrant abuses of statistics, which have shown that border 
crossings are at the lowest they have been in 40 years.
  President Trump has long proved he is not married to the truth or 
facts, and he has no proof to substantiate his wild claims about the 
status of the United States and the Mexican border.
  We cannot abandon our commitment to responsible governing and the 
truth because President Trump is outraged at his inability to fulfill a 
campaign promise.
  There is wide bipartisan support for this measure, and our democracy 
demands that we condemn this subversion of our Constitution and this 
misuse of Presidential power.

  Mr. Speaker, the President clearly laid out the case for the 
declaration of a national emergency in his State of the Union Address 
right here. National


security is obviously the President's highest priority, and I support 
his efforts to build a wall.
  There is a crisis. There is a crisis at the border that could have 
been addressed much sooner and prevented. Open border policies of the 
last administration compounded this growing problem.
  We have schools, hospitals, and other services that have become 
overcrowded. American workers have been hurt by reduced job 
opportunities and lower wages. At the same time, human and drug 
trafficking has thrived.
  In many communities, the notorious MS-13 gang has grown. We have seen 
tragic cases of crimes committed by illegal aliens who have been 
deported not once, not even twice, but multiple times.
  I want to cite just one example from my home State of Missouri. A man 
named Pablo Serrano-Vitorino was deported to Mexico after a felony 
conviction in 2003. He later returned to this country illegally and was 
arrested again in 2014 and 2015 after several more violent incidents, 
but he remained in the U.S.
  Then, in 2016, this individual, who had no right to be in this 
country, was charged for murdering five people in Kansas City, Kansas, 
and Montgomery County, Missouri.
  Stories like this are not unique to Missouri, Mr. Speaker. These 
horrifying events are happening across this country.
  This is a crisis. The men and women who put their lives on the line 
every day to bring order and security to our borders deserve the tools 
that they need to do the job, and now this President is taking decisive 
action to finally address the crisis using the authority provided to 
him by the Congress.
  The National Emergencies Act is very clear. The provisions the 
President will use under title 10 explicitly provide the President with 
clear authority.
  I support the President's efforts. I believe he is well within the 
law in making this declaration, and I urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. 
Res. 46.

began that the President might declare a national emergency to build 
his border wall, my staff and I began working with legislative counsel 
to make sure that Congress would have a say in what amounts to 
constitutional cannibalism by the President.
  This is the most consequential vote we will take in a generation on 
the balance of powers between the legislative and the executive 
branches of government, whether we will respect the separation of 
powers enshrined in our Constitution, stand up for Congress, for this 
country, and for the Constitution, or whether we will stand down, in 
favor of the President.
  The precedent that may be set today and this week, or next week when 
the Senate votes if Congress allows this President's emergency 
declaration to stand will not have ramifications only on this matter or 
the building of a border wall. If the President is successful, he will 
likely come back for more. He will likely circumvent Congress again, in 
the same unconstitutional way.

  Not only will this President do it, future Presidents will do it.
  I ask you this: How are we to tell a future President, if this 
President is successful, that gun deaths, which number in the tens of 
thousands, are not a national emergency, that opioid deaths are not a 
national emergency, that climate change is not a national emergency?
  This will allow a President to sideline Congress from much of 
domestic policy.
  Bear in mind, over the years, Congress has already, on its own, I 
believe, given up a lot of its authority with respect to foreign 
policy.
  It is also clear that there is no emergency at the border. Border 
crossings are at a four-decade low. The folks who are coming today are 
presenting themselves to Border Patrol agents seeking asylum, not 
trying to get around the border.
  There are more law enforcement officers at our border--Federal, 
State, and local officers--than at any time in our Nation's history.
  Since its founding, this country has become the most powerful and 
prosperous on the face of the Earth without a border wall. That is why 
most Americans disagree with the President usurping the power of 
Congress to build his border wall.
  In fact, not only do they disagree with that, they disagree with 
using military construction money on this border project. Cities like 
mine, San Antonio, stand to lose millions of dollars in military 
construction.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.",C001091,2019-02-26

explicitly authorized the President to undertake certain military 
construction projects that are not otherwise authorized by law when it 
passed the National Security Act. The President is working within the 
legal boundaries that the Congress gave him.

right. It is the statutes that allow this President to do this.
  The statutes don't provide for national emergencies on climate 
change. They don't allow for national emergencies on gun violence. But 
they do allow it in terms of this particular issue.
  The President is exactly right. There is a crisis at the border, Mr. 
Speaker. But not only this President recognizes it. The previous 
President, Obama, in 2014, did as well when he requested $3.7 billion 
in emergency spending to secure the border.
  Where was the outrage then? Where was the outrage from my colleagues 
across the aisle?
  President Obama even went further to say that we needed to secure our 
border to deter both adults and children from the dangerous journey 
that they embarked on.
  Where was the outrage across the aisle then, Mr. Speaker? It was not 
there.
  Keeping criminals, human traffickers, and drug smugglers away from 
our communities is paramount.


  Yes, indeed, we do have an opioid problem. We have actually 
appropriated billions of dollars to address that. And yet, somehow, the 
drugs flowing across our southern border are not a crisis?
  Again, President Obama seemed to agree with this and declared a 
national emergency for transnational criminal organizations, 
specifically calling out Mexico's Los Zetas gang, and provided more 
authority for ICE to actually combat that; a national emergency. Where 
was the outrage across the aisle then?
  But we don't even have to look just at the previous administration. 
President Clinton also declared a national emergency to go after 
narcotics traffickers.
  Mr. Speaker, I just find it just unbelievable that here today, that 
we have got these newfound constitutionalists across the aisle, wanting 
to rein in the President's authority.
  This is about defeating President Trump. I encourage a ``no'' vote on 
this resolution.",M001187,2019-02-26

may consume.
  The American people should know that there are not any statutes that 
would allow a President to declare an emergency to build a border wall, 
not one piece of legislation would allow that.
  Previous Presidents have declared emergencies, but they have never 
ventured into the legislative prerogative to allocate funding, and that 
is the difference that we have here.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Nadler), the chair of the Judiciary Committee.",J000288,2019-02-26
234,"TERMINATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2130-4,13,Mr. NADLER,"  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, President Trump's declaration of a national 
emergency, as an excuse to build a wall that Congress explicitly 
rejected, is an abuse of his constitutional oath, and cannot be 
tolerated by a coequal branch of government under the Constitution. We 
must reject this unlawful power grab and reassert Congress' authority 
to exercise the power of the purse.


  The Constitution could not be clearer: ``No money shall be drawn from 
the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.'' That 
command reflects a fundamental principle that is older than our 
democracy itself: The chief executive cannot unilaterally spend 
taxpayers' money or redirect a budget set by the people's 
representatives.
  Earlier this year, Congress reached a bipartisan compromise to fund 
the government, and it was signed by the President. Congress allocated 
limited funding for fencing in certain areas, but squarely rejected the 
President's request to build a medieval barrier across the southern 
border.
  Almost immediately, the President decided to rewrite the budget set 
by Congress, and he told us exactly why. He was not satisfied with what 
he got from the process that the Constitution dictates, so he did an 
end run and made it an emergency.
  He and his aides have barely even tried to pretend that the so-called 
emergency is a real one. They know that illegal immigration is at 
historically low levels. They know that children and families fleeing 
violence are coming here to make lawful asylum claims, not as some kind 
of invading army.
  They know that illegal drugs overwhelmingly get smuggled through 
ports of entry, and that a wall would do nothing to change that. But 
they refuse to let the facts and the law stand in the way of their 
political agenda.
  Even worse, the emergency law that President Trump invoked allows the 
military to redirect funds only if an emergency ``requires the use of 
the armed forces.'' And those funds can be used only for construction 
projects that are ``necessary to support such use of the armed 
forces.''
  But a wall cannot possibly be ``necessary to support'' a military 
operation on the border because our laws prohibit the military from 
engaging in law enforcement activities. The military cannot enforce an 
immigration law, so the President's actions are doubly unlawful. There 
is no real emergency; and even if there were, the President could not 
redirect military funds for a purpose expressly prohibited to the 
military.
  Fortunately, the Constitution does not get suspended based on 
President Trump's preferences about what is convenient or ``faster.'' 
Our Nation's Founders left it up to all of us, including those of us in 
Congress, to act as guardians against exactly this type of assault on 
our constitutional order.
  In that spirit, I proudly support this joint resolution, and I call 
upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and do the 
same.",N000002,2019-02-26

exercised his clear authority under a clear Federal statute, duly-
enacted by Congress, to use funds already appropriated by Congress for 
the purpose of securing our southern border.
  Mr. Speaker, I am glad about one thing today coming here. I am glad 
that, for many of the years I have been here, I came through the Rules 
Committee, and others, and talked about Article I authority. I am glad 
now to see that we have others who have now figured that Article I 
probably needs to be enforced.
  What is interesting is it is selective enforcement against a 
President they don't like, for a purpose they don't want, for a wall 
that they don't want to have because securing a border is not the top 
agenda for them.
  I get it if you don't like it. But argue with the law. The statute 
itself and the President's actions, in accordance with it, rest solidly 
within the separation of powers, and are certainly constitutional.
  If you are citing the Supreme Court case of Youngstown against the 
President's action today during this debate, then I suggest you haven't 
read the case. That reasoning of the Youngstown case only applies when 
the President is acting unilaterally and not pursuant to a duly-elected 
statute by Congress.
  Maybe the selective memory here is because the previous President 
actually did that when he instituted the DACA program under no things 
that he could have found to actually work on.

  Then we discuss the issue of, is there an actual emergency on the 
border? You know, a President once noted, he said: ``We have seen a 
significant rise in apprehensions and processing of children and 
individuals from Central America who are crossing into the United 
States in the Rio Grande Valley areas of the Southwest border. The 
individuals who embark upon this perilous journey are subject to 
violent crime, abuse, extortion, as they rely on dangerous human 
smuggling networks to transport them through Central America and 
Mexico.''
  Most may think that was from the current President. It was not. It 
was from President Obama when he was requesting more money for the 
emergency on the border.
  The problem is the factual basis is there. We sat in a hearing today 
in the Judiciary Committee, and I had to look at the faces of our 
Border Patrol agents and ICE agents, and others dealing with this on a 
day-to-day basis while all they get, many times from this body, is hate 
and derision when they are doing their job that we sent them to do.
  My problem comes back here--if we can argue about different things--
this was under the law and done by Republicans and Democrats for the 
last almost 40 years. If you want to fix this, then you have done what 
you should do under law. You have brought your resolution of 
disapproval.
  But if you really wanted to take Article I authority, then actually 
look at the law itself. If you actually want to change it that is what 
this body ought to be doing.
  If you don't like the fact that the President can do something and 
especially my friends across the aisle who don't want this President to 
do anything, then fix the law. Go into this emergency declaration and 
say, we will define what a national emergency is. We will do that.
  They don't want to do that because they don't want to bind the hands 
because they know that the law was written for a purpose that has been 
upheld for over 40 years. This is simply a show. It is a farce.
  Let's just get to the political aspect of this and say, Mr. Speaker, 
we don't like the President. We don't like what he is doing. Oops, we 
forgot about this law, and the President said, I will act under the 
authority given to me by Congress.
  You can have all the arguments you want, but at the end of the day, 
Mr. Speaker, when you cast this vote, don't hide behind Article I. 
Don't hide between separation of powers. Go to the law and look at what 
the law says and vote ``no.''",C001093,2019-02-26

in fact, a power grab to go outside the bounds of the law and get what 
he failed to achieve in constitutional legislative process. After 
failing to convince the American people and Congress to pay for his 
ineffective, wasteful, multi-billion-dollar concrete wall, the 
President is now trying a desperate end run around Congress with his 
unlawful emergency declaration.
  The President is declaring an emergency over a crisis that does not 
exist. The statute only applies to national emergencies that require 
use of the armed forces for military construction projects ``that are 
necessary to support such use of the armed forces.'' The border wall is 
not a military construction project. It does not require the use of the 
military.


  The immigration law is the responsibility of the Federal immigration 
enforcement agencies, not the military.
  The President's declaration violates Federal law and that is the 
crisis. This is a crisis, a crime against our Constitution. It is an 
assault; it is a rape, what the President is doing now, against the 
Constitution, against this legislative body.

crisis at the border. Changing demographics have created unprecedented 
challenges for the Border Patrol.
  In the early 2000s, most illegal border crossers were young Mexican 
men and our laws allowed us to quickly return them back to Mexico. But 
today, that flow of Mexican men has been replaced with a mix of men, 
women, and children from Central American countries.
  Human traffickers are exploiting the loopholes in our laws and 
understand how our immigration system is broken. These smugglers tell 
vulnerable families that their child is like their ``visa'' to stay in 
the U.S., if they can just get themselves turned in to the border 
patrol. And these smugglers and their propaganda are effective.

  Family apprehensions for fiscal year 2019 are already 572 percent 
higher than fiscal year 2013. And these traffickers don't care about 
the people they smuggle. The result is that immigrants of all ages are 
arriving on our doorstep in terrible health.
  Border Patrol projects a 133 percent increase over last year in 
migrants needing medical treatment after crossing the border. These 
changing migrant flows force our law enforcement officers to act as 
paramedics, rather than enforcing the laws that Congress has passed.
  We need an ``all-of-the-above'' approach to border security, and that 
includes manpower, 21st century technology, and barriers. With this 
approach, we will deter human smugglers and others crossing hundreds of 
miles of open desert with innocent children.
  We know this approach works. In areas where we have built a wall 
system, such as Yuma, illegal traffic has plummeted by 95 percent. 
Let's build on this success.
  I encourage my colleagues to stand by President Trump's decision to 
use executive authority to carry out this approach and keep America 
safe.",R000575,2019-02-26

important distinction.

our southern border. There are no terrorists who are being apprehended. 
There is no invading hostile force, and border crossings remain at a

  Pulling resources from military construction projects, as President 
Trump would do, projects meant to improve readiness and support our 
servicemembers, impacts our national security. It will hurt military 
families who are already dealing with military housing with mold and 
lead poisoning, and outdated schools and medical facilities.
  This declaration of national emergency will keep thousands of Active-
Duty troops needlessly deployed at the southern border and away from 
their scheduled training activities and operational readiness.
  This is a fake emergency; and for President Trump to claim we need to 
build a wall to support our Armed Forces, it is absurd and ridiculous.

  It was President Obama who recognized the crisis at the border. In

funding for what he described as a humanitarian crisis, a humanitarian 
crisis at the border. He specifically cited an increase in family units 
trying to cross the border and the lack of resources to accommodate 
them.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the joint resolution to overturn 
the President's declaration. I think it is very clear that there is a 
national emergency that exists on our southern border because of the 
high rate of unchecked, unregulated illegal immigration, illegal 
immigration that is directly contributing to the flow of drugs, human 
trafficking, and gang members into this country, not to mention the 
humanitarian crisis of those who feel compelled to make this journey to 
illegally enter this country.
  I think there seems to be some confusion among many of my colleagues 
and maybe many across the country about the action of the President.
  President Trump is clearly acting within the authority that is 
provided by Congress to confront a border security and humanitarian 
crisis that constitutes a national emergency.
  The threat to our border security is evident from the sheer number of 
migrants seeking to gain illegal entry into this country, and 
especially the number of criminal aliens in the form of cartels, 
traffickers, and gangs. These people will continue to take advantage of 
our weak borders for their own gain.
  I recognize that Congress has lawfully enacted the authority for the 
President to use military construction funds to support Armed Forces to 
engage in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this joint 
resolution, as the crisis at the border is real.",A000055,2019-02-26

attempt to establish consensus on border security funding, President 
Trump, a self-proclaimed master negotiator, failed to get a border wall 
that he originally said Mexico will pay for, so then he fraudulently 
invoked a national emergency declaration to rob taxpayers of funds from 
other programs.
  The President's brazen decision not only violates Congress' 
constitutional powers of the purse laid out in Article I, Section 9, 
Clause 7, it is also a fabricated emergency propped up by fake 
statistics, racist undertones, and the blatant hypocrisy of a party 
that had complete control of Washington for 2 years and didn't see fit 
to fund this useless, medieval wall themselves.
  By diverting funds from military projects, the President has 
determined that national security takes a backseat to his political 
priorities. Today, in the

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.
  When President Trump declared a national emergency, he did so in 
response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis at our border and with full 
statutory authority vested in laws passed in this very Chamber.
  The majority claims that this resolution of disapproval is in 
response to a power grab by a President acting out of line. Yet, by 
merely disapproving of the emergency declaration, they are preserving 
his statutory powers they claim are inappropriate.
  If my colleagues across the aisle are so concerned about separation 
of powers, why don't they simply reform the laws in title 10 and title 
50 that the President is using to respond to this crisis? The answer is 
because this resolution is not about the division of powers; it is not 
even about border security. The only reason this legislation is being 
considered on the floor today is to obstruct the President's agenda.
  The President has made it clear that he will use all statutory tools

and the misuse of Federal funds. I thank them for those statements, and 
I would like to ask a more personal question.
  Since when do we call human beings in need a national emergency? Have 
all of President Trump's other arguments failed? Is he running out of 
insults for people like me, people who came from Mexico to have a 
better life in this country?
  He used to call people like me bad hombres. When that failed, he 
turned to other insults. And after they lose their shock value, he 
calls us rapists, then murderers. At that point, he ran out of insults 
for people like me, so he referred to us as coyotes.
  Now, when all other labels have failed to achieve his central 
campaign promise to build a medieval border wall, he calls people like 
me a national emergency?
  We must reject this premise as the presence of people like me in this 
country, of people like my constituents in my district, a national 
emergency.",G000586,2019-02-26

border. We are in the midst of a national security and humanitarian 
crisis on our southern border which must be addressed.
  Earlier this month, Congress secured important and necessary funding 
to protect over 55 miles of our most dangerous border where it has been 
so desperately needed. We have also provided funding for over 600 new 
border officers.
  This was a good step in the right direction, but as we see again 
today, our colleagues from across the aisle remain unwilling to address 
our intensifying border crisis. With the national emergency 
declaration, President Trump is taking the steps our country needs to 
stay safe and secure.
  Yes, this is an emergency. Cartels, human traffickers, and drug 
smugglers take advantage of our weak border for their own gain, and it 
must be stopped.
  We need to stop traffickers from bringing young girls and women into 
our country where they are sold into prostitution and slavery. As a 
mother and a grandmother, this breaks my heart.
  We need to stop violent gangs like MS-13 from entering our cities and 
bringing their violence and evil onto our streets.",M001205,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this so-called declaration that

  There is no crisis at the border. There is no basis in law or in fact 
for this unconstitutional emergency declaration.
  Illegal border crossings have not increased; they have decreased. 
There is no evidence of increased criminal activity on the border. 
There is no evidence of increased drug trafficking on the border. There 
is no evidence that terrorists are pouring into the United States of 
America on the southern border.

medieval border wall that this Article I Congress rejected. That is why

as I want to share my thoughts on this purely political effort by the

  Mr. Speaker, the U.S. and Mexico border is 2,400 miles long. My home 
State of Texas is half that border, 1,200 miles.
  Texas knows something others in this Chamber apparently don't know: 
We are at war on the southern border with the drug cartels.
  I say it again. We are at war on the southern border with the drug 
cartels from Mexico.
  The drug cartels are at the heart of every single problem we have on 
our southern border. They have a war going with our families, our kids, 
and our schools with record numbers of heroin, cocaine, and deadly 
fentanyl.
  The drug cartels are at war with our world values by financing 
modern-day sex slaves or forced laborers.
  All of Texas, 254 counties--from Amarillo to Texarkana, to Beaumont, 
to Brownsville, to Marfa--are impacted. They are at war with these drug 
cartels.
  The majority had better wake up and have no more figments of 
imagination. It is time to put politics aside and admit we are at war 
with the drug cartels.

resolution that surrenders to the drug cartels.",O000168,2019-02-26

Georgia for yielding to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution.
  I was in west Texas this past weekend and saw nothing to justify the 
President's designation of a national emergency. There aren't gangs of 
violent criminals and terrorists overtaking our southern border.
  If there were a crisis, it is hard to imagine a worse or less 
effective response than a border wall, which will take months, if not 
years, to build.
  What I did see there are efforts to harden ports of entry. In fact, 
just days before I arrived in El Paso, sharp barbed wire was installed 
in the middle of a busy port of entry. This barbed wire did not give 
off the impression that this busy port of entry was welcoming commerce 
or visitors to the United States. When questioned, officials could not 
say who had signed off on this project or how it fits into border 
security.
  It is time for the administration to stop fear-mongering and accept 
reality. The only crisis on the border is a humanitarian crisis, one 
created by this administration, and a border wall will do nothing to 
alleviate the suffering.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this 
resolution to


stop the President from stripping Congress of its constitutional power 
of the purse.

the Constitution. It is about this institution. It is about the balance 
that we say is equal between the Article I institution and the Article 
II institution.
  That is important to remember. That is why this argument is so very 
important.
  It is not about just a single policy. It is about the kind of 
government that our Founding Fathers instituted, which has been the 
envy of the world and the example to many.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Castro of Texas, and the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus for introducing this resolution.
  I was at the border in California and in New Mexico just a few days 
ago. I was at the border in El Paso with my distinguished colleague, 
the former executive, called judge, of that area. She will speak 
shortly. Ms. Escobar will say there is no war at the border and there 
is no crisis at the border. She will explain that better than I can. 
She lives there.
  At the border, I saw a lot of heartbreak and challenge, but I did not 
see a national emergency that would justify the President ignoring the 
Constitution and trying to make funding decisions without congressional 
approval. That is the issue.
  For my colleagues to say this is a partisan issue, let me call your 
attention to the statements of approximately 20 Members of the United 
States Senate.
  The President admitted on February 15 that this is not a true 
emergency when he said: ``I could do the wall over a longer period of 
time. I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.''
  Not that he needed to do it much faster, but he would just rather do 
it much faster. Of course, if the Mexicans were paying for it, perhaps 
he could have.
  Congress has a chance to answer the President and make it clear that 
he cannot make an end run around the Constitution and claim powers 
reserved for the taxpayers' representatives.
  Mr. Speaker, the Congress of the United States needs to have a spine 
and not lay at the feet of the President of the United States and say, 
``Whatever you want, sir.'' That is not what the people elected us to 
do. We are their representatives, not the President's representative, 
whether it is President Obama, President Trump, President Clinton, 
President Bush, or President Reagan, all of whom I have served with--
two Bushes.
  Our Founding Fathers had enough of King George, so they adopted a 
Constitution that said: We are not going to have a King George. We are 
not going to have an authoritarian regime. We are not going to have the 
executive setting policy. They said the Congress sets policy.
  By the way, 300 of us in this body voted for the funding levels for 
border security. It didn't squeak by, by some partisan advantage--300 
of us, which is to say well over 66 percent.
  Now, Congress has a chance to answer the President and make it clear. 
He demanded that the American taxpayers give him billions for the wall 
that Democrats and Republicans alike say is expensive and ineffective.
  Again, this is not about the wall. This is about our Constitution, 
our institution, and our self-respect.
  He has chosen to ignore the will of the American people, as expressed 
by their representatives. He has opted to set aside the wisdom of our 
Founders for the expedience of getting his own way.
  Constitutional law professor Roger Sloane of Boston University noted, 
last week: ``To my knowledge, no President has ever tried to use 
national emergency funding to appropriate funds Congress refused to 
appropriate.''
  Overwhelming Senate vote; overwhelming vote in this body.
  He went on to say: ``Politically, it would mean the President would 
be seeking . . . to override a bipartisan judgment of Congress.''
  Have we no self-respect? Have we no sense of the balance between the 
executive and the legislative branches of government?
  We are the Article I branch, the policymakers, the people who raise 
money and spend money, not the President--any President, Republican or 
Democrat. And a lot of Republican colleagues, including Senator 
McConnell, said: Mr. President, don't do this.
  Right up until the time Senator McConnell said: I will support you, 
Mr. President.
  First, he was against this, and now he is for it.
  The respected Harvard Law School constitutional scholar Laurence 
Tribe said of the President, on Thursday: ``He is simply trying to do 
what emperors and kings do, not what a President of the United States 
should do.''
  In The Washington Post this weekend, columnist Max Boot noted why we 
are now at a pivotal moment for Members of the President's party in the 
Congress, who are being asked to choose between loyalty to the 
President and fidelity to the Constitution.

  I am sorry the Chamber is not filled. I thought of asking for a 
quorum call. I didn't.
  Fidelity to the President or fidelity to the Constitution, that is 
the choice we make today. That is why this is a pivotal moment. We 
choose between the Constitution and its principles, which have made our 
country the world's envied democracy for almost two and a half 
centuries.
  Boot continued with this: ``Trump's action is an affront to all that 
Republicans stand for.''
  The premise is you continue to stand for this institution and our 
Constitution.
  ``They claim to be pro-military, but Trump's action would take money 
away from the defense budget. They claim to be pro-property rights, but 
Trump's action would result in the taking of private property along the 
border. And they claim to be constitutional conservatives, but Trump's 
action is an obvious violation of Article I of the Constitution: `No 
Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of 
Appropriations made by Law.' ''
  I used to have people coming up here and taking out the Constitution 
and saying: Have you read this document? Do you know what it says?
  Let me repeat it: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in 
Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''
  Now, I have heard the scare rhetoric, and I suggest to my colleagues, 
with all due respect, that kind of rhetoric has preceded every despot's 
takeover of power in the world. There was a crisis. They had to declare 
military law. They had to suspend the constitution and suspend the 
laws.
  That is how despots take power. We stand at the gate to ensure that 
doesn't happen. But we will say more with our votes.
  If we vote yes, we will say that Congress is still the voice of the 
American people. We will say that we are still faithful to the oath we 
took to protect the Constitution and laws of our land. And we will say 
that America, as our Founders promised, has no sovereign but we, the 
people--``we,'' not me, not I. We, the people.
  We must not allow the President to set a dangerous precedent 
stripping Congress of its power of the purse. This is the first time. 
You can say there are a lot of other emergencies. That is correct. But 
this is unique. We must not


allow him to set the precedent whereby any chief executive, Republican 
or Democrat, can declare an emergency any time he or she doesn't agree 
with Congress' funding.
  This is not a partisan resolution. It is supported and encouraged by 
former and current Republican Members who recognize how dangerous it 
would be for the Congress not to act. A group of 23 former Republican 
Members of Congress, including former Senators Olympia Snowe, Dick 
Lugar, Chuck Hagel, and John Danforth have sent a letter to currently 
serving Republican Members yesterday. In it they wrote this: ``It has 
always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how 
strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to 
Presidents or party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional 
Republic, we must act within the borders of the Constitution.''
  Today, a conservative Senator from North Carolina, a Republican 
conservative Senator from North Carolina, said this: ``I have grave 
concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of 
weakening Congress' power.''


  Senators Murkowski and Collins have already said they would support 
this resolution.
  So let us act and do so in one powerful voice--not as Democrats, not 
as Republicans, as Americans; as representatives; as people who have 
put their faith in us to make a judgment to protect their country, 
their Constitution; as Americans who believe in our Constitution and 
the wisdom of our Founders who gave Congress alone the authority to 
appropriate funds and gave the representatives of the people and the 
States a powerful check on the executive.
  I ask all my Republican colleagues: How would you vote if Barack 
Obama were President of the United States today? Think of that. Because 
if you cannot answer ``I would vote the same way,'' then you are not 
being true to your country, to our Constitution, and to your oath.
  If any Member cares at all about the equal status of the Article I 
branch of the Constitution, he or she should vote for this resolution.

  I want to start by saying something: Everybody here in this Chamber 
means well. Everybody here in this Chamber believes they are fighting 
for the right thing for this country.
  Unfortunately, sometimes with these debates, they get heated and we 
begin to ascribe bad motives to the other side. I ascribe no bad 
motives to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and there are 
no bad motives on our side. It is just a little bit of a difference in 
how we see it.
  We are all passionate about this issue, which is evident by the 
quality of the debate we are having here. But I am going to tell you 
why I came to believe that this was a national emergency.
  I was sent down to the border with the National Guard. I went down 
and did 2 weeks with my unit, which is down there for 2 months.
  As part-timers, we go down and we fill in and augment different 
amounts of time. I fly a surveillance aircraft. It is called an RC-26.
  We actually work with Border Patrol, and what we would do is, through 
technology, some of the technology that exists, they would get 
indications of a group coming over the border. We would have a central 
authority that would see these groups coming over the border and would 
take the limited air assets we had and put them on these groups to 
surveil them and then coordinate with Border Patrol, or whatever, to 
come in and get them. And what we saw, frankly, was pretty eye-opening 
for me.
  First off, Arizona has some very rugged territory.
  I have worked Texas, by the way, three times doing this exact same 
mission. I am going to give you an opportunity to guess who the 
President was when I did this mission three other times. It was 
President Obama, because he understood the need for the guard on the 
border.
  So we would see these groups come over. They would go through this 
rugged terrain.
  By the way, I never worked an area in Arizona where there was a 
barrier. We never had to. But there is a lot of area that isn't.
  We would then respond, and basically, 9 times out of 10, any time 
these groups got any indication that Border Patrol was nearby or there 
was an aircraft overhead, they would do what we call a bomb burst. It 
looks like that on the infrared we are using. They would run in all 
different directions, and many people would get separated.
  But do you know who the first to bomb blast away from that group was? 
The first people, every time, were the coyotes who they paid their life 
savings to to bring them over the border--every time.
  In fact, one time that exact scenario happened, and a lady was left 
lost in the desert, hunkered down in a bush. Had Border Patrol not 
found her--sure, she will be deported for that because she came in 
illegally. But if Border Patrol had not found her, I believe that there 
is a chance that she could have been one of the at least 200 bodies 
that they find every year in the desert because they are abandoned by 
their drug traffickers, by their coyotes who are paid for and who pay 
money to the drug cartels.
  That is a big part of where these cartels in Mexico get their money, 
funneling people over the border, human trafficking. We know the 
statistics of the chance of assault during that. We know that kind of 
stuff.
  It wasn't my mission, but my crew was on a mission, the very first 
one, where an illegal was apprehended, and he had 70 pounds of 
methamphetamine on him.
  Now, I know there is way more than 70 pounds of methamphetamine out 
there in the United States, but there are way more people we are not 
seeing come over that border as well.
  People sometimes look at the rugged terrain of Arizona and say, well, 
with mountains and hills, that is the natural wall.
  By the way, I went hiking on those mountains and hills during my time 
off, I will say that.
  But the other interesting thing is a significant amount of the people 
we were following were actually on those mountains and hills. They were 
on the mountains and hills because that rugged terrain is just as 
difficult for Border Patrol to navigate as them.
  In fact, I watched as a Border Patrol helicopter followed a man 
probably 100 feet away. This is on video. Border Patrol can release 
this video if they want. The man was running. The Border Patrol cannot 
insert Border Patrol agents to capture him. This guy is still gone 
today. He had to have been a coyote or a drug trafficker.
  Seeing this repeatedly made me realize this is not a national 
emergency because of immigration. I actually believe in comprehensive 
immigration reform. I want to work with the other side of the aisle to 
fix all these problems that I think we really actually all agree on. We 
just can't admit we agree on all this stuff. I look at this and I say 
this is an 80 percent solution that we can fix.

  But when I came back from the border and I came back from seeing the 
real issue that makes this a national emergency--drugs, human 
trafficking--that is when I realized something had to be done.
  A wall and a barrier is not compassionless. I think border security 
and compassion actually go hand in hand. Because what we are saying is: 
Come over to the United States of America, but do it the right and 
legal way, because, otherwise, these coyotes in the cartel are going to 
take advantage of you, take your life savings, and take you through a 
very dangerous route. And when the going gets tough, they are going to 
leave you to die, because they did that to 200 of them last year in 
Arizona.
  It was an eye-opening experience.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion everybody has in this. I 
respect everybody's debate in this. This is how I came to the 
conclusion I did.

the other side cause the public to believe that there are people coming 
across our border, trying to sneak in, when the truth of the matter is 
the people who are presenting themselves at our southern border, 
primarily, are people fleeing violence in Central America, families, 
women, children fleeing violence in Central America, presenting 
themselves at lawful points of entry, not trying to jump the Rio 
Grande, but at lawful points of entry, and seeking to apply for asylum. 
That is the emergency that my friends on the other side tried to make

Graves) for yielding.
  Today, I have heard a lot of amazing things. My colleague on the 
other side of the aisle, Mr. Johnson from Georgia, said, I believe, 
caravans trying to cross the border are a figment of our imagination. I 
don't know about you, but I think all we need to do is turn on the 
news. I have seen thousands of people traipsing thousands of miles to 
get into our country. In fact, there has been some violence. So I just 
don't understand that statement at all.
  And Speaker Pelosi and Chuck Schumer recently said the crisis at the 
border is manufactured. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that I live 
in the State of Arizona, a border State, and I have visited the border, 
and I have met with the border agents and border officials at the 
border.
  They have told me, firsthand, there is a crisis at the border. They 
have told me, firsthand, when I asked do we need a border fence, they 
said, yes, it is part of the solution.
  You know, I am here today to ask for reason. The Republican 
legislature, the majority last year, tried to pass legislation that 
would not only secure the border but, as a compromise, would have given 
legal status to the DACA recipients. Not one Democrat voted for it.
  Can we please get together and solve this problem?
  It is unfortunate that the President had to resort to this because 
Congress, the Democrats, would not vote for border security. And so I 
support the President in his declaration for emergency. I support him 
in protecting our Nation--his number one duty--and I oppose this 
resolution.",L000589,2019-02-26

have been spent under the unified control of Republicans--both Houses

the $5 billion down payment on a border wall that is going to cost 
about $30 billion. They didn't do it then; they want us to do it now--
or they want Trump to actually be able to do it without the 
legislature.

on the U.S.-Mexico border. I live on the border. My family has lived on 
the border for more than 100 years. I can assure my colleagues that the 
border has never been safer; the border has never been more secure.
  In fact, what I am more worried about today than what is happening on 
the U.S.-Mexico border, than those vulnerable asylum-seekers coming to 
our front door asking for help, is I am more worried that people in 
this Chamber are willing to ignore the oath of office that we took on 
the day that we were sworn in, that we would violate the Constitution 
that we promised to uphold.
  I am also far more worried about the fact that they are willing to 
divert funding that is going to our U.S. military in favor of a 
political prop, a monument to xenophobia, a campaign promise. In fact, 
Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, stands to potentially lose $275 million.

unconstitutionally attempts to override Congress. The Constitution 
clearly grants Congress the power of the purse. This declaration took 
place after weeks of negotiations which resulted in Congress rejecting 
the President's wall in a bipartisan manner.
  This declaration could take billions of dollars of disaster relief 
aid from families, endanger military construction, and impact our 
military readiness. There is no national emergency at the southern 
border, only a humanitarian crisis created by our President.
  This President has repeatedly taken actions that undermine our 
country's ability to defend against real threats to national security.
  Congress must act as a check on the President's abuse of executive 
power. Congress has the opportunity to defend and protect the 
Constitution and assert its role as a coequal branch of government, and 
it must do so in order to set a precedent and protect our democracy.

across this country should be made to suffer from this unlawful and

yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, what we are witnessing is a President who poses a direct 
threat to both our military families and America's national security.
  First, as we have heard, there is no border emergency. That is a 
fabrication. The administration's own statistics show that crossings 
and apprehensions are at a historic low. The vast


majority of illegal drugs come in at our ports of entry. A wall will 
not stop that.
  Many who cross our borders are women and children. They are not 
running from border agents. They are seeking them out for help and for 
asylum.
  Second, this will make life harder for America's military families, 
and, thus, hurt our national security. Who would ever intentionally 
make life tougher for the brave men and women who serve our country? It 
is monstrous, really, when you think about the sacrifices that they 
already make for this country.
  As the chair of the Appropriations Committee Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Subcommittee, tomorrow I will 
hold a hearing to ask our service Secretaries exactly which projects 
they previously told us they really needed, but now should be 
sacrificed for a needless wall.
  What will these leaders ask their troops to give up just so Trump can 
have a useless, wasteful wall? Training or intelligence facilities? 
Hangars for planes that cost billions? Schools for our military 
families' children? This is a power grab.
  After failing to get his way in a funding dispute with Congress, 
Trump is throwing an unconstitutional temper tantrum. He is using the 
tools of an authoritarian, jeopardizing our military readiness to steal 
himself a wall that he could not get the lawful way. The dangerous 
precedent he will set is one that I hope all of my Republican 
colleagues will reject.
  The President says a wall will keep Americans safe, but stealing 
funds from military families makes us all less safe. Bypassing Congress 
and the Constitution, and starving military families of funding is not 
patriotism. It is everything that true patriots fight against.",W000797,2019-02-26

may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that most drugs coming into this country 
are coming in at ports of entry, and I would make a correction: Most 
drugs that are caught are caught at ports of entry. We don't have any 
idea what is coming in across the border.
  When we say that, this is like saying we are going to reinforce the 
front door, but we are going to leave the back door wide open. We don't 
know how many drugs or the amount of drugs that are coming across the 
border, particularly in rural areas, because we just simply can't 
patrol it.
  As the gentleman from Illinois pointed out, you can't deploy Border 
Patrol quick enough to catch much of this. So we don't know how many 
drugs are coming through in other areas. We have a pretty good idea at 
ports of entry because we catch them there.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",G000546,2019-02-26

may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, it is harder for me to imagine how a big, beautiful wall 
will somehow bestow upon us knowledge that people are jumping over it 
or going under it.
  Those kinds of things do not work across the entire border. That may 
have its place at some points, and I am sure we have border wall and 
border fencing in the locations where it is necessary, but in the other 
locations, we need--in addition to more Border Patrol officers who are 
paid a living wage--we need the technology and the other assets that 
can surveil and help with the apprehension of people who are coming 
across the border at points that are not legal points of entry.

  But the point is, today's crisis that faces the people of Central 
America and drives them to our southern border is driving them to 
lawful points of entry to seek asylum protection under this Nation's 
laws, and that is something that they are entitled to.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. Jackson Lee).",J000288,2019-02-26
290,"TERMINATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2130-4,69,Ms. JACKSON LEE,"  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  The only crisis is the constitutional crisis that has been created by 
the President of the United States by his direct and ill-conceived 
abuse of power which is noted in the Constitution as a violation of the 
Constitution.
  It is sad that the President has declared a national emergency for 
the purpose of misappropriating funds from previously designated and 
important uses to build a wall, uses that would be dealt with in a 
national emergency in case of war that would then call for the building 
of direct materials and buildings necessary for troops engaging in war.
  The only response to my good friend who has come back from the border 
and saw people going over the border is to engage more Border Patrol 
agents and train them to do the job that they are designated to do. We, 
as Democrats, support that.
  Illegal border crossings are at a near 40-year low. Sixty national 
security personnel, ambassadors, CIA, DNI, and others have indicated 
that this is wrongheaded. It is wrong.
  The President's declaration clearly violates Congress' exclusive 
power of the purse, and if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the 
balance of powers, violating our Founder's vision for America. That is 
unconstitutional.
  To quote Thomas Paine in ``Common Sense,'' it says, `` . . . in 
absolute governments the king is law, so in free countries the law 
ought to be king.'' This is the abuse, the declaration, and we should 
vote for the underlying resolution to restore constitutional order.",J000032,2019-02-26

Homeland Security Committee, the numbers of Mexicans from Mexico has 
decreased.
  The numbers coming now are what we call OTMs, other than Mexican. 
They are coming and fleeing bloodshed in countries where they are being 
threatened with a decapitation of their head.
  Mothers are being told that if you stay, we know you are pregnant, 
you can have the baby, and we will kill you after the birth. These are 
the stories that those of us who visited the border are hearing over 
and over again.
  If there is a crisis, it is a humanitarian crisis. We, as Democrats, 
have no problem with funding the resources necessary for the border, 
including, as indicated, the increase in personnel, technology, and 
transportation equipment.
  I have been to the border when the need for night goggles and other 
types of equipment were rendered important. Let us do the right thing. 
Vote on this resolution, and do the constitutional point of restoring 
order to this government.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in 
defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency 
issued by the President on February 15, 2019.
  The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the 
petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the 
United States.
  As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the 
Committee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on 
numerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently 
that there is no national emergency or national security crisis that 
justifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or 
compels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I 
to check and balance the Executive Branch.
  The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national 
emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely 
correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in 
Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that 
``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''
  In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling 
data available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's 
national emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.
  The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every 
region of the country, by every income group and education category.
  National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous 
in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not 
constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former 
Republican senators and Members of Congress.
  They understand that after failing to convince the American people or 
Congress to pay


for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion dollar concrete 
wall, the President has now embarked on a course of conduct that is 
deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks and balances 
wisely established by the Framers and which has served this nation and 
the world so well for nearly 250 years.
  Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the 
constitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate 
11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency 
declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and 
negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the 
Congress of the United States.
  The Congress will not tolerate this.
  Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming 
evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false 
information regarding the state of our southern border.
  Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.
  Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people 
leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging 
population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic 
decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.
  Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a 
slight increase from 2017.
  The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs 
agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the 
553,378 apprehensions in 2016.
  To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border 
Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in 
2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.
  In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are 
parents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme 
poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
  But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border 
seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest 
since the 1970s.
  The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve 
the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts 
agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are 
smuggled through legal ports of entry.
  The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living 
in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
  These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas, 
Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.
  Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration 
enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other 
enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US 
Marshals, and Secret Service.
  The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than 
59,000 personnel.
  CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more 
than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of 
19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.
  Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active-
duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the 
estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of 
National Guard to the border.
  Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress, 
a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border 
wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has 
appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.
  The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress 
to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes 
Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military 
construction.
  Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of 
these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly 
and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.
  In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,'' 
but has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''
  Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national 
security officials including former secretaries of state, defense 
secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a 
statement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the 
President's emergency declaration.
  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's 
declaration makes America less safe.
  The President is stealing billions from high-priority military 
construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential 
training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American 
people safe, directly undermining America's national security.
  The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive 
power of the purse, and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the 
balance of powers, violating our Founders' vision for America.
  Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision 
transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism, 
constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.
  That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members 
of Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46 
and uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist 
efforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching 
president.
  To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the 
King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold the rule of law and the 
Constitution, and reject the President's power grab; I urge a 
resounding Yes vote on H.J. Res. 46.",J000032,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I believe that most learned colleagues in this Chamber 
understand that under U.S. law, we have granted persons approaching our 
border the right to apply for asylum. That doesn't mean that asylum 
will be granted, but they certainly have the right to apply for it.
  It is the humane thing to do in a civilized society. This is the law 
that America has proceeded under for centuries, and now we have a naked 
power grab by the chief executive of this great Nation, the President 
of the United States, seeking to do the job of the legislative branch, 
and his own job. But there is a problem. It is only the legislative 
branch that appropriates funding for various occurrences.
  The legislative branch has not given this President what he has 
sought; that is, a down payment on a border wall, which is a monument 
to a campaign promise that he made. This legislature has not given him 
that authority, and so in a naked power grab, he is seeking to do it by 
declaring an emergency when, in fact, no emergency exists.

thank him for the eloquent way that he has presented this legislation 
to the floor of the House.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to quote from the Constitution of the United 
States. It begins with our statement of purpose of the Nation, with the 
preamble.


  ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect 
Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the 
common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this 
Constitution for the United States of America.''


  Immediately following that sacred purpose, it says: Article I, the 
legislative branch.
  Perhaps it is time for our country to have a values-based civics 
lesson. I applaud our colleague, Congressman Castro, for his leadership 
in ensuring that this House was ready to reassert our responsibility 
under the Constitution and its systems of checks and balance.
  In their wisdom, our Founders rejected the idea of a monarch. They 
didn't want to live under that. They made that clear. They fought a War 
of Independence to free themselves from that. Therefore, in their 
wisdom, they put forth in this Constitution a heart, soul, and core of 
it: the separation of powers, coequal branches of government to be a 
check and balance on each other.
  They saw the wisdom of that and then, of course, added the Bill of 
Rights with further freedoms enumerated. But the core of the 
Constitution is the separation of power.
  Today, we are on this floor of the House, and our colleagues have 
spoken eloquently about the reality or mythology of the crisis at the 
border that the President contends. They have spoken eloquently about 
the opportunity cost of the money that the President wants to use for 
this ill-conceived wall and what it means to our national security.
  But we in this House of Representatives, each one of us, and everyone 
in public service in our country, takes an oath of office to support 
and defend the Constitution of the United States. It is our oath. We 
promise.
  That Constitution is about the separation of powers that is being 
usurped by the executive branch. We in the legislative branch cannot 
let that happen.
  In fact, I appeal to our Republican colleagues because I do believe 
and trust that they are people of their word, and if they take an oath 
to uphold the Constitution, they will honor it with their vote on the 
floor today, in keeping, by the way, with, under the previous House 
Speaker, our colleagues across the aisle placed a high priority on the 
separation of powers and Congress' constitutional prerogatives.
  The Republican A Better Way agenda, which they put forth in 2014, 
read as follows: ``The people granted Congress the power to write laws, 
raise revenues, and spend and borrow money on behalf of the United 
States. There is no power more consequential. . . . Yet for decades, 
Congress has let this power atrophy, thereby depriving the people of 
their voice.''
  Their Better Way goes on to say: ``The Founders insisted on a 
separation of powers to protect our constitutional liberties.''
  Their proposal goes on to say that James Madison ``warned that the 
Constitution is a `mere parchment barrier' unless each branch asserted 
its powers to keep the others in check.''
  That is all in the Republican agenda for A Better Way of 2014, so you 
would think it would be in keeping with their vote today.
  In that spirit, then-Speaker Ryan often lamented that Congress 
``keeps forfeiting the game, yielding to the executive branch, giving 
the President a blank check, not even bothering to read the fine print 
in some cases.''
  We are not going to give any President, Democratic or Republican, a 
blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States. We would be 
delinquent in our duties as Members of Congress if we did not overturn 
what the President is proposing. He is asking each and every one of us 
to turn our backs on the oath of office that we took to the 
Constitution of the United States.
  I do not believe that the Republicans want to do that. I don't think 
it is consistent with what they had advocated in the near term and 
historically.
  Is your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to 
the Constitution of the United States? You cannot let him undermine the 
strength of your pledge to protect and defend the Constitution.
  Again, our colleagues have talked about the opportunity cost of 
taking money from our national security and spending it in this way.
  I was at the border this weekend. We all have our stories and the 
rest, but whatever you think about the wall, let's just put that aside 
for the moment. Whatever you think about where you take the money from 
and where you put it, which is substantial, put that aside for the 
moment. The question is: What do you think about yourself, your 
Congress, your conscience, and your oath of office? I trust that our 
colleagues will be consistent in their beliefs and join us in honoring 
the oath we all take to support.
  The resolution is not about politics. It is not about partisanship. 
It is about patriotism. It is about the Constitution of the United 
States, which I hold in my hand here. George Washington on the cover of 
this says: ``Its only keepers, the people.''
  We in the people's House are the keepers of this Constitution. We in 
the Congress are the keepers of this Constitution. We in this Congress 
are in Article I, the Congress of the United States, spelled out very 
clearly in the Constitution that the powers given to the legislative 
branch are the power of the purse, the power to declare war, powers 
enumerated very carefully by our Founders.
  How can you ignore that? I urge strong bipartisan support of this 
vital resolution to honor our oath to bear true faith and allegiance to 
the Constitution.

time.
  I find it ironic, I guess, and actually it is kind of ludicrous, that 
we talk so much about how much this wall is going to cost and how 
inhumane it is and how immoral it is, yet we build thousands and 
thousands of miles and spend millions and millions of dollars on noise 
abatement wall, 30 feet high and 20 feet high, in our suburbs and our 
urban areas all over the country. Yet we can't do something to protect 
our border.

  That is not a crisis, Mr. Speaker. This is a crisis. What we are 
talking about today is a crisis.
  President Obama agreed when he requested emergency funding in 2014 to 
deal with the crisis on the border, when he declared a national 
emergency because of transnational drug traffickers.
  Since fiscal year 2012, Customs and Border Patrol has seized 4 
million pounds of drugs at ports of entry and more than 11 million 
pounds of drugs between ports of entry. And nearly three times as many 
drugs are seized between ports, Mr. Speaker.
  Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize the 
need for a border wall, voting to authorize a wall in 2016 and again 
under President Obama in 2013. Last year, we passed bipartisan 
legislation to address the growing impacts of opioids in our 
communities, drugs that continue to flow into our country through our 
southern border. We all agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that there was a 
crisis, but now, suddenly, they are calling this a manufactured crisis.
  The National Emergencies Act is clear, Mr. Speaker. The President's 
authority is clear. The President is acting within the authority that 
Congress has given him.

  Mr. Speaker, in approving the joint resolution terminating President

Congress to pay for an ineffective border wall.

resolution to terminate President Trump's phony declaration of an 
emergency at the southern border.
  Unable to convince Congress to pay for his wasteful border wall, the 
president has decided to make an end run around the legislative branch, 
upending democratic norms and creating a dangerous precedent.
  To pay for the wall, the Administration intends to rob money from 
critical military construction projects and from other parts of the 
Defense Department and the Treasury.
  This would threaten national security, undermine the readiness of our 
military, and could disrupt critical infrastructure improvements that 
benefit service members and their families--all to prop up a political 
vanity project.
  As a country, we should be focused on real law enforcement needs, not 
a border wall that will do virtually nothing to keep Americans safe.
  Today's vote to block the president's emergency declaration is a 
critical first step, and I am proud to cosponsor this resolution.
  I hope my Republican colleagues recognize that this isn't about 
politics--it's about defending our democratic institutions and the rule 
of law from presidential overreach.
  It's about protecting our institution and our Constitution in the 
face of an unprecedented power grab from a president who rejects 
Congress' authority as a co-equal branch of government.
  Mr. Speaker, the greatest power we have as members of Congress is the 
power of the purse. As we exercise that power, we should invest 
responsibly in priorities that strengthen and protect American families 
and communities.
  We do not exist to rubber stamp the President. I urge my Republican 
colleagues to join us in defending our constitutional prerogatives and 
upholding the rule of law.",L000480,2019-02-26
309,"TERMINATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2130-4,88,Mr. DeFAZIO,"  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today had I been present, I would have 
voted in strong support of the bipartisan, privileged resolution to 
terminate President Trump's proclamation ``Declaring a National 
Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States.'' I was 
detained due to severe weather and cancelled flights in Oregon.
  While there is no doubt that our immigration system is broken, the 
president's wall and his proposed funding level is an irresponsible 
waste of taxpayer funds for a structure that would be ineffective and 
do very little for our national security. The emergency declaration is 
nothing more than a power grab by the president to fulfill a campaign 
promise, violating existing law and our constitutional system of 
separation of powers.
  Congress has already rejected the president's proposed border wall, 
and alternatively, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, made robust 
investments in our border security. These investments include $1.375 
billion for approximately 55 miles of physical barrier along the 
southern border, $564 million for imaging equipment at our ports of 
entry, $100 million for new, additional border security technology, 
serious investments in the Alternative to Detention program to provide 
relief to over-crowded detention facilities, and additional funding for 
attorneys and courtroom expansion to assist with our country's growing 
immigration court system backlog.
  Despite these important investments, the president has proposed 
taking more than $6.7 billion to build his wall, including $3.6 billion 
from the Department of Defense's (DoD) high-priority military 
construction projects. These funds are meant to support much-needed 
improvements on military bases around the world, and misallocating 
these funds could undermine the training, readiness, and quality of 
life for our men and women in the Armed Forces. He has also proposed 
stripping $2.5 billion from the DoD's drug interdiction program, which 
could have serious impacts on our ability to combat the flow of illegal 
narcotics.
  Furthermore, the Military Construction Codification Act only 
authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reallocate funds for 
construction projects during a national emergency if the project is 
``necessary to support'' a ``use of the armed forces.'' Our Armed 
Forces are not responsible for enforcing our immigration laws and using 
these funds in this way is in direct violation of existing law.
  Of serious additional legal concern is the fact that the 
administration would need to seize significant amounts of property not 
owned by the federal government in order to build a wall. Currently, 
more than two thirds of border property is owned by private parties or 
the relevant states. In 1952, the Supreme Court held in Youngstown 
Sheet and Tube that President Truman's declaration of national 
emergency, even in the midst of an international armed conflict, did 
not permit him to unilaterally seize private property.
  In recent days, more than two dozen former Republican lawmakers and 
almost 60 former senior national security officials have come out in 
opposition to President Trump's national emergency declaration. These 
individuals are united behind the idea that allowing the president to 
``ignore Congress'' will deprive the American people ``of the 
protections of true representative government.''
  The bottom line is that the president's national emergency 
declaration is an abuse of his constitutional authority and an affront 
to the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the 
purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the president from 
spending money that has not been appropriated. Congress entrusted the 
president with authority to reallocate funds during unforeseen and 
urgent situations, such as wars and natural disasters. By declaring an 
emergency when Congress has overwhelmingly rejected his border wall in 
favor of compromise legislation, President Trump is creating a 
dangerous precedent for future political disputes. Congress must reject 
this presidential overreach and assert its constitutional authority.",D000191,2019-02-26

this resolution to terminate the President's declaration of a national 
emergency on February 15, 2019. No such emergency exists on the U.S.-
Mexico border. The President is using this declaration as a false 
pretense to divert taxpayer money, primarily away from the Department 
of Defense, toward the construction of a wasteful, ineffective wall 
along the southern border. This declaration is an unacceptable abuse of 
power that circumvents the constitutional authority of Congress. For 
these reasons, I am a cosponsor of this resolution to terminate the 
declaration pursuant to the provisions of the National Emergencies Act.
  I support taking action to make sure we have the appropriate 
personnel, equipment, facilities, and resources to protect our borders 
from criminal activity like trafficking in drugs or people. Building 
this wall is not a good investment and it will not stop crime or 
illegal immigration along our southern border. Instead of building 
walls, we should instead build bridges to those who are fleeing 
violence and legally seeking asylum in our country. I urge my

  Today I commend corrections officers at FCI McKean and Loretto and 
all across our country who help protect our communities and uphold the 
values of our justice system. Officers face dangerous situations in the 
workplace every day, but that does not deter them.
  Just like our first responders, corrections officers are regularly 
risking their lives to keep their community members safe. They enforce 
the rule of law, and they carry out their duties without complaint.

318,STATEHOOD FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2109,1,Ms. NORTON,"  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, tomorrow, our residents who are fortunate 
to live in our Nation's Capital will come to the Capitol as part of 
their Lobby Day to ask the Congress to pass the D.C. statehood bill.
  Most Americans are unaware that the Americans who live in their 
Nation's Capital have the fewest rights of any Americans. That is at 
the same time that those 700,000 residents who live in the Nation's 
Capital pay the highest taxes per capita, higher than the taxes of the 
residents of any State.
  As you might imagine, the residents of the District of Columbia are 
seeking to become the 51st State of the Union. I am pleased that 
already almost 90 percent of Democrats are on our D.C. statehood bill. 
I am grateful to Senator Carper, who will soon introduce this same bill 
on the Senate side.
  There are many reasons that no Americans should fail to have equal 
rights if they pay equal taxes. But surely, service in every war the 
Nation has fought, even beyond being first per capita in Federal income 
taxes, should qualify the 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia 
for equal treatment as the 51st State.
  On this poster, we see why any State would stand for its rights: 
World War I, more casualties of people who live in the District of 
Columbia than three States; the Korean war, more casualties than those 
of eight States; World War II, casualties are more than four States; 
and the Vietnam war, casualties that outnumber those in 10 States.
  The residents of the District of Columbia will be here to say to my 
colleagues that 200-plus years--it is about 218 years now--without 
equal rights is 218 years too many.
  Nobody who lives in our country and pays taxes should be 
unrepresented on this floor when votes are taken. I appreciate that I 
can now vote for the District of Columbia in the Committee of the 
Whole, where some votes are taken. But District resident have no 
representation on this floor and none in the Senate at all.
  It is past time to right this wrong. We cannot do it for those who 
have died in war for our country. We can certainly do it in their 
memory.

the final round, Meghan was in second place with $14,000. She was able 
to clinch her victory, however, when she successfully answered that 
Mariah Carey was the New York native who, in the 1990s, had eight of 
her first 10 Billboard Top 40 hits reach number one.
  Her closest competitor, whom she trailed by $400 going into Final 
Jeopardy, incorrectly guessed Whitney Houston, putting Meghan over the 
top.
  Madam Speaker, I congratulate Meghan on this major accomplishment. It 
is a major feat to be selected to participate on this famous show to 
begin with, but to win against other highly intelligent competitors is 
something truly noteworthy.
  I wish Meghan and her family all the best, and we congratulate her on 
this achievement.

330,DAVID ELDER,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE212-4,0,Mr. BALDERSON,"  Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of 
David Elder, a committed public servant, loving husband, and devoted 
father and grandfather. David passed away on February 23, 2019 at the 
age of 70. He was a dedicated public servant to Worthington, Ohio, for 
36 years.
  David's admirable career of service to Worthington began when he 
interned while completing his master's degree at The Ohio State 
University. Skillfully demonstrating his capabilities as an intern, he 
was hired in 1971 to serve as an administrative assistant. Over the 
course of the following decade, David proved he possessed a dedicated 
work ethic, which helped him advance in his career. He was appointed as 
Worthington City Manager in 1981, a title he held for 26 years. Though 
he left office in 2007, his legacy is not forgotten. His strong ethical 
character, enthusiastic compassion, and devoted service to his home 
town made him the consummate example of a public servant.
  Though he will be missed dearly, I am confident that his memory will 
live on through his exemplary life's work and will continue to serve as 
an inspiration for individuals considering a path in public service. 
Please keep his beloved wife, Ann, daughters Stephanie and Lauren, and 
numerous grandchildren in your prayers as they celebrate David's life 
in the coming days.

332,SENATE RESOLUTION 79--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1494-3,0,Mr. KAINE,"  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, our Nation's continued economic progress 
and the social mobility of our citizens are contingent on the education 
and skills of the American workforce and its ability to adjust and 
fulfill the needs of the 21st century economy. Career and technical 
education (CTE) programs are an essential piece of every student's 
education, providing them access to the important knowledge, skills, 
and credentials needed to obtain careers in rapidly growing, high-
demand fields. Today, approximately 12.2 million students across the 
Nation are enrolled in CTE programs offered by thousands of career 
academies, comprehensive high schools, CTE high schools, community 
colleges, and CTE centers. Through intentionally designed applied 
learning, these students gain workplace skills and technical training 
that mirror in-demand positions in the workforce.
  In the coming decade, a projected 3 million skilled workers will be 
needed to fill infrastructure positions in the United States, including 
jobs related to designing, building, and operating transportation, 
housing, telecommunication, and utilities facilities. CTE programs 
intentionally match employability skills with workforce demands, 
lowering the probability of students dropping out of high school and 
increasing their likelihood of graduating on time. These skills-based 
training programs will help fill the estimated 30 million U.S. jobs 
available with an average income annual income of $55,000 that do not 
require a bachelor's degree yet necessitate some level of postsecondary 
education.
  Across Virginia, I hear from manufacturers frustrated by the shortage 
of qualified skilled production employees--roles that require the 
training and instruction provided in CTE classrooms. It is essential 
that we elevate the important role of CTE in the country's ability to 
meet the interconnected challenges of economic development, student 
achievement, and global competitiveness. Last year, Congress affirmed 
the importance of CTE by passing the Strengthening Career and Technical 
Education for the 21st Century Act which supports CTE programs in 
secondary and postsecondary education.
  Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus co-chairs Senator Portman, Senator 
Baldwin, and Senator Young and 47 colleagues in the Senate, I am 
pleased to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate February as 
Career and Technical Education (CTE) month. CTE Month encourages 
students, parents, counselors, educators, and school leaders to learn 
more about the diverse educational opportunities offered in their 
communities, and recognize the valuable role of CTE in developing a 
well-educated and highly skilled workforce in the United States.
  By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, it is our 
aim to raise greater awareness of the importance of improving access to 
high-quality CTE for millions of America's students and our nation's 
ongoing economic competitiveness.

instead of fully funding border security, a few minutes ago actually 
passed H.J. Res. 46, which would reverse the President's emergency 
declaration that he signed 2 weeks ago that secures our border.
  Now, in Maryland, we have a real problem. We are the second most 
active State for MS-13, which just walks across our border now because 
we don't have barriers. We have a huge problem, like every State in the 
Union, with drugs, with opioids that are just walked across our border, 
which isn't secured. And, Madam Speaker, we have a huge problem with 
human trafficking.
  If this resolution is passed by the Senate, I hope that the President 
vetoes the resolution, we sustain that veto, and we finally secure our 
border.

Sheriff Jack Welsh as he retires after 43\1/2\ years of service to 
Lenawee County, Michigan.
  Sheriff Welsh has served in many roles during his law enforcement 
career, beginning as a volunteer reserve deputy and eventually working 
his way up to captain.
  After his initial retirement from the sheriff's department in 2007, 
he went on to become an emergency management regional planner.
  Then, in 2008, he accepted the call to run for sheriff, where he has 
served ever since.
  Law enforcement officers like Sheriff Welsh are the fabric of our 
community. Day in and day out, they answer the call to serve and 
protect.
  Over the years, Sheriff Welsh has been one of the very best. He is a 
man of integrity, a dedicated public servant, and a trusted friend to 
many. He has been instrumental in making Lenawee County a better and 
safer place to call home.
  I thank Sheriff Welsh for his decades of distinguished service, and I 
wish him nothing but the best as he begins his retirement.

January 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Yoho) for 30 minutes.",,2019-02-26
346,AMERICAN VOTING SYSTEM,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2226,1,Mr. YOHO,"  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I rise today in opposition 
of H.R. 1. This bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attack on the 
American voting system designed to allow Democrats to keep the majority 
in the House of Representatives, and I will explain and illustrate.
  As a Member of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure that 
every American vote is counted and protected, especially because our 
democratic society relies on participation in the democratic process 
through free and fair elections. While I support efforts to involve all 
Americans in our electoral process, I cannot support this 
unconstitutional legislation.
  Madam Speaker, let me lay out for you some of the most absurd 
provisions in this legislation.
  H.R. 1 creates Federal Government subsidized elections. For the 
people watching on C-SPAN, if they don't have insomnia, I want them to 
hear that again. H.R. 1 creates Federal Government subsidized elections 
through a 6-1 ratio for government matches to small donor contributions 
for congressional or Presidential campaigns.
  For the government to give matches--subsidized elections--that means 
they are taking money from you to go to candidates, hopefully of your 
choice, but not necessarily. So the donor contributions for 
congressional or Presidential campaigns, which means for every $200 an 
individual donates, the Federal Government will take $1,200 of the 
American taxpayers' money and distribute it.
  Additionally, H.R. 1 removes the checks our current voting system has 
in place to ensure eligible voters are casting ballots by forcing 
States to accept online and same-day voter registration. I don't think 
that has ever happened before, where H.R. 1 removes the checks our 
current voting system has in place to ensure only eligible voters are 
casting vote ballots by forcing States to accept online and same-day 
voter registration with no penalties for ineligible voters.
  That means somebody could show up, an individual, and cast multiple 
ballots or votes, or vote without meeting the current requirements, and 
they will not be reprimanded. There is no recourse. Who is going to go 
after somebody after they have already cast their vote and they weren't 
an eligible


voter? Nobody will go after these people, so it can sway elections. 
That is what H.R. 1 does.
  By removing the consequences of illegal voting, this bill is, in 
turn, encouraging it. It should be doing the opposite. The right and 
privilege of us as American citizens to vote is something we should all 
garner and protect as American citizens. And, again, this is not a 
partisan issue, it is not Democrats or Republicans, this is an American 
issue, and I think people would be incensed on all parties.
  Additionally, this bill allows Federal employees to take 6 days of 
paid leave to be poll workers. So the American taxpayers are going to 
pay Federal workers to be poll watchers. This is something that has 
always been done voluntarily by our precinct captains, both Republican 
and Democrat, in our districts, where politics is always best locally.
  But the Federal Government wants to intervene here and say: No, we 
are going to give you guys 6 days off. How many people do you think, 
that are Federal employees, will take 6 days off of paid leave? 
Probably a lot, wouldn't you expect?
  Madam Speaker, we pay our Federal employees to do the job they were 
hired to do, not to be poll workers for our districts. That is 
something that the American voting process has done for over 200 years 
by volunteers that are passionate and care about this country.
  In fact, Federal employees already receive paid leave that they can 
take for any purpose they choose, including being poll workers. Why 
should the Federal Government pay? And I want to reword that, because 
it is not the Federal Government paying them. It is the American 
taxpayers paying money out of their paycheck that goes to the Federal 
Government that the Federal Government thinks they know better how to 
spend that money than they do. So why should the Federal Government pay 
to give them additional leave that can only be used for this purpose?
  Madam Speaker, there are just three provisions outlined in this 
almost 600-page bill, and I would venture most people will not read 
this when it comes up for a vote. And while I can further elaborate, I 
will let my colleagues share their thoughts with you.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).",Y000065,2019-02-26
347,AMERICAN VOTING SYSTEM,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2226,2,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for leading this 
Special Order.
  Madam Speaker, I want to speak to two specific aspects of this.
  First of all, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the sweeping 
unconstitutional attack on the electoral system that it represents. It 
would federalize our electoral system and usurp the authority of States 
and their citizens to manage their own elections by imposing 
unnecessary and unconstitutional restrictions that interfere with their 
fundamental democratic rights.
  H.R. 1 would restrict freedom of speech and undermine Americans' 
constitutional rights under the First Amendment by increasing the power 
of the Federal Government to regulate and control political speech.
  It would criminalize a vast range of legal activities, increase 
government censorship, and impose an enormous administrative compliance 
burden on candidates that would make it harder for everyday Americans 
to participate in our political system and even run for office.
  It would also weaken important safeguards to ensure the integrity of 
our electoral system and guarantee that every American vote is counted 
and protected. This could expose future elections to greater risk of 
cyber manipulation and mass voter fraud.
  It could limit the ability of election officials to ensure that only 
eligible voter votes are counted and cripple the effectiveness of State 
voter ID laws.
  Now, I have to speak to an issue that particularly impacts those of 
us who live in States that have independent redistricting commissions. 
I live in Arizona. Many years ago, our voters said: We don't want the 
legislature designing the congressional districts and the State 
legislative districts anymore; we want an independent redistricting 
commission, so they voted for it. So we have a five-member commission: 
two Republicans, two Democrats, and an Independent. They design the 
congressional districts.
  This bill would take that away from them. It would bring it back to 
Washington, D.C., after creating an unelected board that would then 
design these districts for States. Now, I ask you, why would that be 
better than the independent redistricting commission in Arizona that 
was approved by the Arizona voters? It doesn't make sense to me, and it 
doesn't make sense to my constituents, I can tell you that.
  We struggle enough. We struggle enough with the independent 
redistricting commission with Arizona appointees. Imagine if we have no 
connection to the appointees.
  I am also always amazed at people who don't get to Arizona and don't 
realize the vastness of that State. It is a unique State: 7 million 
people--5 million of them in one county, one metropolitan area; 1 
million in another county; and then another 1 million sprinkled 
throughout this vast State. That takes local knowledge and it takes 
local experience to create those districts, there is no doubt about it. 
The Arizona Constitution is filled with the criterion on how to 
redistrict in Arizona. This would usurp the Arizona Constitution.
  H.R. 1 is fraught with many, many problems. I have just gone through 
a couple of them for you tonight.
  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for his leadership on 
this, his fight, and I appreciate him sharing time with me tonight.",B001302,2019-02-26
348,AMERICAN VOTING SYSTEM,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2226,3,Mr. YOHO,"  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs. I appreciate his help.
  I have got a top 10 list here--actually, it has turned into a top 11 
list--of the 10 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1.
  Again, I want to remind you that the Democrats took over at the 
beginning of the year. We are $22 trillion in debt. And they will say: 
Well, it is President Trump's fault. Well, we can say: It is President 
Obama's fault. And they will say: Well, it is President Bush's fault. 
And it can go all the way back to George Washington, I expect.
  But the fact is it is a bipartisan issue that needs to be dealt with. 
So the top 11 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1: It creates, again, a 
6-1 government match to any small donor contribution of $200 or less in 
a congressional or Presidential campaign, meaning for every $200 the 
government will match $1,200.
  So let's look at the facts. Where does that $1,200 come from? You go 
to work, you get a paycheck at the end of the week, at the end of the 
week you notice that you don't get paid your gross pay, you get paid 
your net pay. The rest of the money comes to the government and the 
government is going to use that money, when we are $22 trillion in 
debt, and give out subsidies to support, hopefully, your candidate. 
This has never happened before in our government, and we are at $22 
trillion in debt. It does nothing to solve our national debt.


  Number two on the list: Creates a new voucher pilot program--a pilot 
program.
  And I have to hand it to the Dems. They love programs that give out 
moneys and grants, this voucher pilot program that grants eligible 
voters a $25 voucher of hard-earned taxpayer dollars to donate to any 
campaign of their choosing.
  The Federal Government has no need to do this. Again, they are taking 
money from people and using it for that which the government is not 
mandated by our Constitution to do.
  Number three: Authorizes an inappropriate use of Federal workers and 
taxpayer dollars by granting Federal employees 6 days of paid vacation 
to serve as poll watchers.
  I would venture that come election day, the largest majority of 
Federal employees for 6 days will be poll watchers and not running the 
government. This is just bad policy.
  Number four: Weakens the voting system of the American people by 
increasing the election system's vulnerability and failing to implement 
the necessary checks and balances regarding who is registering to vote. 
H.R. 1 will force States to allow online voter registration, automatic 
voter registration, and, I think the most dangerous and egregious, 
same-day voter registration.
  So that means I can show up in Florida, my home State, and I can 
register to vote that day. I can drive to Georgia


and register to vote that day. I can go to Alabama, Louisiana, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and I can possibly vote in every one of those 
States, because the driving distance, I could make that.
  So I could vote in possibly seven or eight States as a single person 
on the day of voting. Nobody could validate that. Yet the election gets 
calculated and determined on those kinds of voting, and I don't think 
that is what anybody wants.
  I would hope, regardless of your political affiliation, you would 
stand up to say this is wrong. We need to make sure these safeguards 
are in place to protect that one very, I think, sacred, precious right 
of all voters, of all American citizens, the right to vote.
  Number five: Diminishes the process of election day voting by 
expanding ``no excuse'' absentee voting and allowing for eligible 
voters to be able to cast their ballot by mail with no additional 
safeguards to this process.
  That means provisional ballots that get sent in, their signature 
can't be questioned. It doesn't need to be questioned. It doesn't have 
to be the correct signature, but it will be counted as a vote.
  I would think a party that put that in place would be afraid of that, 
because it really weakens the democratic process we go through as a 
constitutional republic.
  Number six: Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing 
sworn statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for 
signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the 
voter registers online.
  Let me read that again.
  Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing sworn 
statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for 
signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the 
voter registers online.
  Now, think about that. I can't get on an airplane without a picture 
ID. I can't purchase medication, over-the-counter cold medication with 
phenylephrine in it, without a picture ID, but we are going to allow 
people to vote without a picture ID just by signing an affidavit saying 
I am who I say I am. And, again, that won't be verified until after the 
election.
  It has fraud written all over it, and I think it is unconscionable 
that the Democrats would even consider such a thing on something that 
we hold so sacred in this Nation, that we brag about and we boast about 
in the world as being the longest serving democracy in the world using 
a democratic process in a constitutional republic, that we are going to 
allow such shoddy type of verification.
  Again, it is unconscionable that they would even consider bringing 
this up.
  Number seven: Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations.
  Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations. We have people going 
to jail because they have lied to the FBI. We have George Papadopoulos 
who lied to the FBI, and he went to prison for 14 days. But I can lie 
and not be who I say I am, and I can vote on this Democratic bill, H.R. 
1, and I have no recourse against me. There is no consequence for me 
being a liar.
  And I just think a party that wants to have those kinds of policies 
in place as a whole needs to look in the mirror and say: What are we 
trying to do?
  Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration 
and voting practices as protected under Article I, Section 4 of the 
Constitution and violates separation of powers by Congress mandating 
ethics standards for the Supreme Court. H.R. 1 is a constitutional 
overreach.
  Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration 
voting practices as protected, as I said, under Article I, Section 4.
  Number nine: Violates constitutional rights under the First Amendment 
by prohibiting any false statements relating to Federal elections, 
including time, manner, place, qualifications of candidates, or 
endorsements of candidates enforced by a partisan FEC, which is the 
Federal Elections Committee.
  Number 10: Empowers trial attorneys by establishing private rights of 
action by allowing candidates to litigate their way to victory.
  We saw this in the last Presidential election. We saw this in the 
last gubernatorial election in my State of Florida. We saw this in the 
senatorial race in Florida, where people were going to sue, and they 
didn't have the legality of doing that, but this bill would allow that.

  And I think one of the largest grievances for H.R. 1 that all people 
ought to be upset with is that it mandates voter registration--mandates 
voter registration. What that means is the Federal Government says you 
must register to vote.
  I agree, we should all register to vote, but can the government 
mandate you?
  We tried this with the Affordable Care Act that the Democrats ran 
through in a partisan manner in this Chamber, no Republican support, 
mandated that people had to buy a product even if they didn't want 
that.
  Madam Speaker, that is wrong, and that is why that part got struck 
down, the individual mandate got struck down, as it should have, 
because the Federal Government was saying: If you don't do what we say, 
we are going to fine you.
  You know, that sounds like China. China does that. They have their 
good citizen score, the Orwellian good citizen score that they monitor 
what you do, and if you don't do it, you don't get the prizes of the 
Chinese Government. Are we turning into that, mandating voters to 
register?
  Last Congress, I chaired the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation 
Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs. And it was amazing because I got to 
travel to countries around the world that have just started free and 
open elections in a Western, democratic style. It pains me to see these 
countries with a new democracy where 95 percent to 98 percent of the 
people show up.
  If you look at Iraq or Afghanistan, they are walking around with the 
purple finger at risk of their lives, because for once in their life 
they had an opportunity to vote, to vote for somebody that they wanted 
in power--a foreign concept to them. Yet in this country, we want to 
take that away from people.
  As we continue on, there are some myths on H.R. 1.
  It has been designed to fund, elect, and maintain Democratic 
majority, and I want the American people to know that. The Democrats 
introduced this 571-page package of Democratic priorities without 
allowing for input from Republican Members or going through the 
standard House Committee.
  This is something that they railed against us. All the 6 years I have 
been in Congress, they have railed against us about no open process, 
yet they come out with a 571-page package of Democratic priorities 
without allowing for input from one Republican Member.
  H.R. 1 will waste taxpayers' money, federalize the election system, 
weaken safeguards surrounding voter registration, and violate 
Americans' constitutional right to free speech under the First 
Amendment.
  The estimated cost of this that we got for H.R. 1, because of all the 
subsidies and the other garbage that is in this, is over $10 billion to 
the American taxpayers--$10 billion--when we are already at $22 
trillion in debt.
  I would like to go through a few myths.
  Democrats are empowering citizens. That is the myth. The facts are 
Democrats are using citizens' hard-earned taxpayer dollars to fund 
their candidates:
  Voucher from the government to the campaign: Through this bill, 
eligible voters would receive a $25 voucher from the Federal Government 
that they can use to donate to the campaign of their choice, meaning 
hard-earned taxpayer dollars are going to be going to the government, 
to their campaign of choice;
  Government matching campaign donations in congressional races: Under 
H.R. 1, the Federal Government will be required to match small 
contributions under $200 at 6 to 1. Taxpayer dollars will be going to 
the government to fund candidates;
  Government matching campaign donations in Presidential races: Also, 
under H.R. 1, there is a 6-to-1 government match of small contributions 
in a Presidential campaign, up to $250 million. A quarter of $1 billion 
would be going towards the Presidential campaign, and there is no limit 
to contributions.


  Another Democrat myth: Democrats are promoting integrity. The facts 
are Democrats are promoting the interests of Washington, D.C., swamp, 
not yours:
  Federal paid vacations: Federal workers would get a 6-day paid 
vacation to serve as poll watchers;
  16-year-old voters: H.R. 1 will open the door to 16-year-old voters 
by requiring States to allow them to register and vote;
  Free speech violation: Prohibits any false statements related to 
Federal elections, including time, manner, place, qualifications, 
candidates, or endorsement.
  And I want to go back over this one other myth. Democrats are 
creating vulnerabilities in the voting system:
  Automatic voter registration--automatic voter registration, mandates 
from the Federal Government, boy, how the Dems like that--requires all 
States to adopt an automatic voter registration system that would be 
relying on the Federal Government for records. There would be no 
criminal punishment for an ineligible voter who is registered in error.

  Madam Speaker, as you have heard, my colleagues and I have severe 
concerns about H.R. 1. While my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are marketing it as a fix to the American voting system, what it 
really does is degrade the standards we have had in place for over 200 
years to protect American voters and the voting process.
  As Members in Congress, we have the responsibility to ensure that 
every American has the right to vote and the access to vote and that 
that vote is guaranteed and protected. H.R. 1 does not do this, and I 
encourage my colleagues to consider this implication and not support 
this bill.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

349,GRAND CANYON CENTENNIAL,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1487,0,Ms. McSALLY,"  Ms. McSALLY. Madam President, in January 1908, President Theodore 
Roosevelt famously declared, ``Let this great wonder of nature remain 
as it is now. You cannot improve on it.'' He said these words while 
designating the Grand Canyon as a national monument. Eleven years 
later, it became a National Park, and today marks the centennial of 
that designation.
  Known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Grand 
Canyon is more than history to Arizona, it is a part of who we are. 
Millions of visitors come to see this magnificent national park, from 
its archeological sites to its one-of-a-kind trails; and for centuries, 
this vast array of canyons and mountains has served as a home to many 
different peoples, including many Native American tribes.
  It was in 1869 that geologist John Wesley Powell first led an 
expedition down the hazardous Colorado River, during which he noted the 
ancient clues he found hidden in the layers of rock that told the story 
of its creation. His expedition led to future explorations further 
chartering and mapping the great canyon. By the time it officially 
became a National Park in 1919, the Grand Canyon attracted some 44,000 
visitors. Today, Arizona hosts more than 6 million visitors each year, 
and with a total economic impact of almost $1 billion a year, it is the 
greatest attraction in our State.
  All Americans, but especially Arizonans, are truly blessed to have 
such a natural wonder to visit like the Grand Canyon. I share in Teddy 
Roosevelt's amazement, passion, and wonderment of the Grand Canyon, and 
I will continue to advocate for this park so that it may last for many 
more generations to come.

352,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1468,2,Mr. CARPER,"  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise this evening to speak on a 
subject that, with the groundswell of activism, has once again captured 
national attention--and rightfully so.
  Many years ago, I was a young naval flight officer stationed at a 
mock field naval air station in the Bay area out in California, 
preparing for the first of what would be three tours of duty in 
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. I joined there with tens of 
thousands of people one day to celebrate our country's first-ever Earth 
Day. I will never forget it.
  This was back when polluters dumped waste into our waterways with 
impunity. Garbage littered our shores, and too many rivers oozed 
instead of flowed. One of them was in Cleveland, OH. The Cuyahoga 
River, north of where I went to school at Ohio State, actually caught 
on fire. Factories spewed toxic fumes, and acid rain fell from the sky. 
The urgency was clear then, and it is even clearer today.
  That very first Earth Day was a transformative experience for me, and 
it will serve as an inspiration for me for the rest of my life.
  As I look at what is happening across our country today, I see the 
movement for bold and transformative action to save our planet. I see 
the faces of those who were there with me that day in Golden Gate State 
Park.
  I have had a lot of different jobs since then, but it is not lost on 
me that I stand here today on the brink of yet another watershed moment 
as the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public 
Works--the committee that oversees our Nation's environmental laws--to 
talk about climate change.
  In the days and weeks ahead, Senator McConnell intends to engage in a 
ploy to try and undermine the Green New Deal by calling a vote for a 
resolution he does not even support. I believe he hopes that, in turn, 
there may be some disruption and damage inflicted on the Democratic 
Party and the climate change movement.
  To the American people, hear this; it is a simple message: We 
cannot--we will not--allow cynicism to win, not now and not with so 
much at stake.
  When it comes to climate action, there could not be a starker 
difference in this Chamber between the Democratic Party and the 
Republican Party in this debate.
  We, as Democrats, may not agree on exactly how we should address 
climate change, but we all agree it is happening. We agree that human 
activity is the main cause, and we agree that we must act now.
  Democrats know that climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. It 
is not an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning 
organization. It doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from 
our Nation's leading scientists and leading scientists from all around 
the world.
  Just 3 months ago, 13 Federal Agencies released a comprehensive 
climate report that described the dire economic and health consequences 
we face if we fail to take meaningful action to address climate change 
now. I may be mistaken, but I believe those 13 Federal Agencies were 
acting under law signed by a Republican President. I believe it was 
George Herbert Walker Bush.
  This report is the Fourth National Climate Assessment. It was 
developed over a 3-year period by more than 300 Federal experts and 
non-Federal experts who volunteered their time--who volunteered their 
time.
  Here is a brief summary of their report: The science behind climate 
change is settled. Let me say that again. The science behind climate 
change is settled.
  From our warming oceans to our atmosphere, climate change is 
happening, and human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, is greatly 
contributing to this crisis.
  Our Nation's scientists have found a direct link between climate 
change and the extreme weather we experienced in 2017, which altogether 
cost the American economy more than $300 billion--that is $300 billion 
in economic damages, more than any year before.
  Scientists are no longer asking if climate change is happening but 
rather how bad is it going to be. How bad is it going to be? Numbers 
and the facts don't lie. It will only get worse if we do nothing.
  If we don't act on climate change by 2050, wildfire seasons could 
burn up to six times--six times--more forest area every year. If we 
don't act on climate change, we will see more extreme flooding that 
devastates small communities like Ellicott City, MD, not far from here, 
which has been hit by not one 1,000-year flood in the past year but 
two. These are floods that are supposed to occur maybe once every 1,000 
years. They had two of them in the last 2 years.
  If we don't act on climate change, rising temperatures, combined with 
increasingly frequent and severe rain, mean farmers are likely to 
experience a reduction in corn and soybean yields by up to 25 percent. 
If we don't act on climate change, we will see more deadly category 5 
hurricanes and storm surges like the ones we saw with Hurricanes Irma 
and Maria just 2 years ago.
  If we do not act on climate change, we will see economic pain across 
every major sector of our economy in this country. The 2018 National 
Climate Assessment concludes that at the end of this century, climate 
change could slash our gross domestic product by 10 percent.
  How much is that compared to what? Well, compared to the losses we 
sustained in the great recession just a decade ago, 10 percent is more 
than double those losses--more than double.
  It doesn't matter if you are from a coastal State or from a 
landlocked State. I have lived in both. It doesn't matter if you care 
about public health or the environment or if you care about our economy 
or national security. The fact is, every person living in


this country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate 
change if they haven't already done so today.
  We have two options. We confront this challenge head on--reduce 
carbon emissions, enhance resiliency, and support millions of new clean 
energy jobs--or we could choose to ignore the problem and pass the 
buck. To whom? To our children, to their children, and to their 
children.
  Senator McConnell, President Trump, and Andrew Wheeler at EPA want to 
pass the buck. They prefer to walk away from the growing threat we 
face. Instead of pursuing any ideas to address climate change and 
protect Americans from its effect, sadly, the Trump administration has 
promoted policies that increase our dependency on dirty energy.
  President Trump has even said he doesn't believe in climate change. 
He doubts the credibility of his own scientists at NASA and at NOAA, as 
well as 97 percent of the global scientific community. Continuing to 
misinform the American people and delay real climate action puts 
American lives and our economy at risk.
  It doesn't have to be this way. As Democrats, we choose to confront 
climate change. We choose to do so now. We know our communities are 
feeling the pain now from the climate crisis because we see the effects 
of climate change every day across this country.
  We may not yet agree on exactly how we must address climate change, 
but we all agree on three things. Here they are. One, we agree climate 
change is real; two, human activity during the last 100 years is a 
dominant cause of the climate crisis we face today; and three, the 
United States, and especially the Congress, that is us, the House and 
the Senate, and the administration should take immediate action to 
address the challenge of climate change.
  That is why I will be introducing a resolution that says just that. 
Democrats know we can have a healthy climate and a strong economy. They 
are not mutually exclusive. Anyone who says otherwise is preaching a 
false choice.
  Democrats know this because of the work we started with President 
Obama in the White House, where we accomplished real actions to put 
this Nation on a path of net zero emissions. Our Republicans friends 
across the aisle should know this because of the work done by the 
former President, the late George Herbert Walker Bush, years earlier 
that I just alluded to a minute ago.
  During the Obama administration, starting with the Recovery Act, the 
Federal Government provided economic incentives, environmental targets, 
and supported market developments to encourage investments in the clean 
energy of the future.
  Thanks to the investments during the previous administration, 
consumers are paying less for energy, and more than 3 million people in 
this country went to work today in the clean energy sector--3 million 
and growing.
  Democrats know we must build on this progress, and that is why we 
continue to support policies that reduce our Nation's carbon footprint, 
help create a fair economy, and support those most vulnerable to 
climate effects, but in the U.S. Senate, as in most places, it takes 
two to tango, and for over two decades Democrats have put forth 
different policies that use market forces, make big investments in 
technology, or set strict standards. We have done them all, and we 
don't seem to get very far with our friends on the other side of this 
aisle. I know because I have cosponsored many of these efforts.
  Let me just say this. We are not going to give up. We are going to 
keep on trying. We will not back down. We are going to stand our 
ground.
  Let me leave our colleagues with this message today. This should not 
be an issue. Climate action should not be an issue that divides us as a 
body. It shouldn't divide us as a country or as a world. It should 
unify us.
  I thank Senator McConnell in advance for allowing the Senate to 
devote a fulsome period of time to this important discussion. How we 
choose to act today will not decide our fates. How we choose to act 
today will decide the fates of generations of Americans--not just our 
fates but generations of Americans that will be on this Earth long 
after the rest of us are gone. So let's get to work. Time is wasting. 
Let's get to work.
  I yield the floor to the Senator from Massachusetts, who has done 
great work on this for as long as I have been alive--almost as long as 
I have been alive, my friend and my colleague who has been a giant on 
these issues for a long time and continues to be.
  I yield the floor.",C000174,2019-02-26
353,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1468,3,Mr. MARKEY,"  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I thank our great leader on the 
Environment Committee for his visionary work on this issue. I am here 
for the same purpose today. I am here to talk about climate change, 
about our climate crisis, and about the mistake it would be to put 
Andrew Wheeler in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.
  Climate change is an existential threat to our country and to the 
planet. We know this because the world's leading scientists, the United 
Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, just made that 
warning late last year. It is an existential threat to the planet.
  The U.N. report told us we have very limited time until we are past 
the point of no return, and the most catastrophic impacts of climate 
change are irreversible.
  Our own Federal scientists across 13 Agencies also just warned in the 
National Climate Assessment that the impacts of climate change are not 
in the future, but they are happening in our communities right now.
  Here is what all 13 U.S. Federal Agencies said. They said our efforts 
do not yet approach the scale necessary to avoid substantial damages to 
the economy, environment, and human health. These are Earth-shattering 
reports about the state of our Earth. These are the doomsday reports 
about what happens if we do not take bold action.
  The dire consequences of climate change, in fact, are arriving. A 
tenfold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic, 99 percent loss of 
coral reefs, and a doubling of species lost around the world. In the 
Northeast, in worst-case scenarios, by the end of the century, both the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Logan Airport will be under 
water, and over 20 percent of Boston's population will face flood risk.
  The climate emissions are not slowing down. In 2018, emissions 
increased 2.8 percent. We have the ``Denier in Chief'' in the White 
House, and this week Republicans in the Senate are poised to confirm a 
coal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
  During his confirmation hearing, when I asked whether he agreed with 
the conclusions of the National Climate Assessment report, Mr. Wheeler 
said he still needed additional briefings before he could make a public 
comment on it. Let me repeat that. The nominee of Donald Trump to run 
the Agency charged with protecting the planet from climate change had 
not even sufficiently reviewed the climate report from our own Federal 
Agencies before his confirmation hearing. He also said he considered 
the report to be a representation of the worst-case scenario and that 
what we face is ``a climate issue.''
  Well, the worst-case scenario is one in which the Republican Senate 
will confirm a former coal lobbyist to head the Environmental 
Protection Agency. The worst-case scenario is the Trump 
administration's plans to roll back the Clean Power Plan and the fuel 
economy emission standards, the single largest steps we have ever taken 
to address climate change. We are in a worst-case scenario, and we need 
to dramatically change course.
  That should start by not confirming Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, 
to run the Agency charged with protecting our planet. Andrew Wheeler's 
answers on the climate crisis should be disqualifying. His record as a 
coal lobbyist should be disqualifying. We should come together and 
reject Andrew Wheeler as the head of the EPA.
  The impact of climate change on ordinary families on their health, on 
our Nation, on our security, and on our future is too urgent. We must 
be bold. We must be ambitious.
  That is why I have introduced the Green New Deal resolution. It lays 
out a serious, bold, aspirational set of goals


that meet the scale of the threat we are facing. It is a set of 
principles, not prescriptions. The Green New Deal will allow us to 
engage in massive job creation to save all of creation. It calls for a 
massive 10-year mobilization to transform our climate, our economy, our 
democracy. It is about jobs and justice.
  An overwhelming number of Americans support climate action, and a 
majority of Americans support a Green New Deal. Never in our history 
have the interests of all Americans been so united in a single issue: 
climate change.
  From the air we breathe to the jobs that employ us, to the 
neighborhoods we live in, to the economy we operate within, climate 
change defines our existence. This is the time for serious solutions. 
Global temperatures are the highest in recorded history. Wealth 
inequality is at its highest point since the era of the Great 
Depression. The erosion of our coastlines, the erosion of earning power 
of workers, the pollution of our planet, the pollution of our democracy 
by Big Oil and Koch brothers financing, the relationship between these 
ills and injustices is undeniable, but the challenge is not 
insurmountable.
  It will only be through a historic intergenerational commitment to 
end climate change that we create the kind of democracy that works for 
all Americans. This Green New Deal mobilization will make the United 
States the global leader on clean energy and climate action.
  This mobilization will be the greatest blue-collar jobs program in a 
generation. This mobilization will be an opportunity to repair the 
historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities that have 
borne the worst burdens of pollution from our fossil fuel economy--
these communities that also will be the most affected and the least 
able to respond to the impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal 
represents an opportunity to lift up all workers and all communities.
  President Roosevelt was right when he said about the New Deal that 
``statesmanship and vision, my friends, require relief to all at the 
same time.''
  We are talking about a historic, 10-year mobilization that will 
mitigate climate emissions and build climate resiliency. We have acted 
on this scale before, and we must do it again.
  We have already laid the foundation for our climate future. In 2008, 
we had only 1,200 megawatts of total solar capacity in the United 
States. Today, we have 65,000 megawatts. In 2008, we had only 25,000 
megawatts of total wind capacity. Today, we have 98,000 megawatts of 
wind capacity. In 2008, there were only 2,500 all-electric vehicles in 
our country. Today, we have 1 million, with 500,000 new all-electric 
vehicles to be sold this year. Most of all, what we have seen over the 
past 10 years is a growing movement for climate action. In wind and 
solar, we now have 350,000 people who are employed. That didn't happen 
10 years ago; it is happening today.
  The Green New Deal is not just a resolution; it is a revolution. 
Republicans and climate deniers are taking mathematical liberties to 
say it would cost too much to act, but the cost of inaction on climate 
will be far higher. Over just the past 2 years, the cost of storms and 
the cost of fires in our country created over $400 billion in damages. 
By the end of this century, it will be tens of trillions of dollars 
that we will lose. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If 
we start today, we can avoid the worst, most catastrophic consequences. 
For those who say we can't afford to act to address this crisis, I say 
we can't afford not to.
  The question is, Will any Republican stand up to fight for these 
goals? The Republican Party is about to confirm a coal lobbyist to run 
the Environmental Protection Agency. That is where we are in 2019, with 
the worst scientific reports coming from the U.N. and our own 
scientists--a threat of an existential risk for the planet--and we are 
about to confirm a coal lobbyist.
  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be bold the way President Kennedy 
was in 1962 when he called for a mission to the Moon to be accomplished 
within 10 years. He said it would not be easy. He said we would have to 
invent metal that did not exist and propulsion systems that did not 
exist. He said we would have to bring that mission back safely through 
heat half the intensity of the Sun, and we would have to do so safely 
within 10 years so that we could control outer space. We did that, 
ladies and gentlemen, and we can do it again.
  We have to accept this challenge. We can do it. We can unleash an 
innovation revolution in our country, and again we will do it to save 
all creation by engaging in massive job creation, a blue-collar 
revolution hiring millions of workers to do this job.
  I thank you, Madam President. This is a very important week before 
us.
  I yield back to my colleague.",M000133,2019-02-26

Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island. He is up every day of his life on 
this issue, and when he speaks, he speaks with authority. I just want 
to say what an honor it is to be here today.",M000133,2019-02-26
359,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1468,9,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It goes the other way.
  Sometimes it seems that our friends on the other side of the aisle 
think that the only people who are watching this conversation are 
fossil fuel industry lobbyists and CEOs and electioneers.
  So we are going through, shortly, a truly preposterous exercise on 
the floor of the Senate, which is that a party that has brought up no 
significant legislation in the time that Leader McConnell has had the 
floor is now going to bring its first measure related to climate for a 
floor vote, and it is something they intend to vote against. It is 
something they intend to vote against. When you bring a measure to the 
floor that it is your intention to vote against, that is not 
legislating. Something else is going on.
  Now I think this was a very clever stunt. We don't know quite where 
it was cooked up, but we have observed that the Wall Street Journal 
editorial page is a relentless mouthpiece for the fossil fuel industry, 
having published climate denial articles literally within the last 
year. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called for this stunt 
vote, and it was less than 24 hours before the Republicans in the 
Senate jumped up, scampered out, and did exactly what they were told to 
do by the fossil fuel industry's mouthpiece, the Wall Street Journal 
editorial page.
  I am sure there were champagne corks banging into the ceilings of the 
boardrooms for ExxonMobil, Americans for Prosperity, and the Koch 
Industries as all of these fossil fuel executives and lobbyists cheered 
this stunt. But in the Senate, we actually have a larger audience than 
just fossil fuel donors; the country is watching and the world is 
watching, and what they are seeing right now is, frankly, an 
embarrassment.
  It is not just this stunt that reflects a broken Senate; it is a much 
larger problem of a Senate that cannot deal with the climate change 
issue in a bipartisan fashion.
  I would state that when I got here in 2007, the Senate could deal 
with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2008, the Senate could 
deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2009, the Senate 
could deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. The reason I 
know that is because I was here then, and I saw as many as five 
bipartisan efforts to deal with climate change during that period, with 
different Republican and Democratic Senators. Then along came the 
Citizens United decision in January 2010, and from that moment after, 
it was like watching a patient drop dead in the emergency room. The 
heartbeat of activity on climate change just flatlined on the 
Republican side of this Chamber.
  I think the fossil fuel industry--I know the fossil fuel industry 
asked for that decision from the Supreme Court and the five Republican 
Justices. I think they anticipated what the decision was going to be, 
and they immediately went to work to squelch and crush any dissent from 
their orthodoxy


on that side of the aisle. The result has been that there has been no 
significant piece of climate legislation to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions and to deal with this problem since Citizens United that any 
of our colleagues now will cosponsor or support. It has just been 
silent, and it is a dramatic failure in this greatest deliberative 
body.
  I will state, as others have stated, as Ranking Member Carper and 
Senator Markey have said, that the science on this is now beyond 
dispute. The science on this is irrefutable. If we fail to deal with 
this problem, the consequences will be catastrophic and irreversible.
  ``Irrefutable science.'' ``Catastrophic and irreversible 
consequences.'' I am actually quoting somebody when I say that. Do you 
know whom I am quoting? I am quoting from 2009 Donald Trump--Donald 
Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and the Trump 
Organization signed this full-page advertisement in the New York Times 
in 2009. ``If we fail to act now,'' they said, ``it is scientifically 
irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible 
consequences for humanity and our planet.'' So as much as the fossil 
fuel-funded mockery in which the Republican Party has engaged, 
challenges these facts, even the Trumps knew this a decade ago.
  In trying to describe the Green New Deal, one might describe it as 
something that, if you invested in it, would ``drive state-of-the-art 
technologies that will spur economic growth, create new energy jobs, 
and increase our energy security all while reducing the harmful 
emissions that are putting our planet at risk.'' That is a pretty good 
capsule of the Green New Deal.
  Guess what Donald Trump and his family said in the same 
advertisement.

       Investing in a Clean Energy Economy will drive state-of-
     the-art technologies that will spur economic growth, create 
     new energy jobs, and increase our energy security all while 
     reducing the harmful emissions that are putting our planet at 
     risk.

  All you have to do is listen to the 2009 Donald Trump to understand 
that the science of climate change was then irrefutable and it is even 
stronger now and that the consequences of our failure to act and our 
obedience, our adherence to fossil fuel-funded propaganda and orthodoxy 
will lead to consequences that are catastrophic and irreversible--said 
a decade ago. We have had 10 more years of unrestricted emissions since 
then.
  Just the basic tenets of the Green New Deal are ``a clean energy 
economy [that] will drive state-of-the-art technologies that will spur 
economic growth, create new energy jobs, and increase our energy 
security.''
  With the words of Donald Trump, I rest my case and yield the floor.",W000802,2019-02-26

361,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1468,11,Mr. BROWN,"  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, think about what we just heard, first 
from Senator Markey talking about a fossil fuel lobbyist in the year 
2019 being chosen to head the EPA--a fossil fuel lobbyist--when there 
has not been a bill on this floor or any motion coming from Senator 
McConnell to deal with climate change, to deal with one of the greatest 
if not the greatest moral issue of our times--nothing on this floor. 
You heard what Senator Markey said. This administration has done 
nothing to address this issue, and President Trump selects a fossil 
fuel lobbyist to be head of the EPA. It is the same thing over and over 
again.
  We have to take aggressive action to protect our planet and protect 
our future now. That means accelerating our transition to carbon-free 
power. It means investing in technologies that make our manufacturers 
the most energy efficient in the world. It means creating jobs in clean 
energy all around the country.
  I have always, as a House Member living in Lorain, OH, and as a 
Member of the Senate--for years, I have always refused to accept the 
idea that you have to choose between good environmental policy and 
good-paying jobs. We have proved that is simply not true. We have 
proved it in my State, where we have lots of wind turbines, made 
usually with American-made steel. We have proved it in Toledo, where we 
have one of the biggest solar energy manufacturers in the country. We 
proved it in the auto industry, where the auto industry has generally 
had a pretty good decade making more fuel-efficient cars. We put 
Americans to work, and we can change course on climate change before it 
is too late.
  Mitch McConnell and President Trump seem to think climate change--
that is notwithstanding what Senator Whitehouse said--is a joke. I have 
news for them. Climate change is not something to play political games 
with; it is a crisis we need to confront and set an example around the 
world. It is a crisis we need to confront and to set an example for our 
partners around the world.

  It would be shameful enough to have no ideas and no plan to confront 
our biggest threats. But not only do President Trump and Leader 
McConnell have no plan, not only are they denying the problem, and not 
only are they standing in the way of solutions, but they are actually 
working to make climate change worse. It is just despicable.
  They are spreading lies and stacking the administration with shills 
for the fossil fuel industry. They stacked the administration with Wall 
Street cronies to do bank regulation. They stacked the administration 
with fossil fuel cronies and shills to do energy and climate and 
environmental regulation.
  We got news this week that the White House is going to use your 
taxpayer dollars to set up a panel to promote junk science and spread 
the debunked conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.
  This week we will vote on the President's nominee to head the EPA, a 
lobbyist who would be overseeing the same special interests who have 
paid his salary. Andrew Wheeler is just the latest in a long line of 
cronies from the fossil fuel industry who President Trump has put in 
charge at the EPA and the Department of the Interior.
  Climate change is not a future problem. It does damage to this 
country right now. It is threatening thousands of Ohio workers who rely 
on Lake Erie for their livelihood, whether it is tourism or other 
industries that rely on clean water.
  Climate change makes algal blooms worse. Off the shores of Toledo, it 
contaminates our lake, threatens our drinking water, and hurts small 
business. Nobody on that side of the aisle seems to give a darn.
  I have talked to farmers who have been farming in the Western Lake 
Erie Basin for decades. They tell me they are experiencing heavier rain 
events more often and with greater intensity compared to even 15 years 
ago. Hotter summers and shorter winters will only make this problem 
worse.
  It is time for the President of the United States to stop sabotaging 
the country he is supposed to lead. It is past time to rejoin the Paris 
Agreement, to restart the Clean Power Plan, and to implement aggressive 
fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. It is time to create new 
jobs in clean energy and energy-efficient manufacturing. It is time for 
the United States to be the leader the world looks to. It is time to 
take this threat seriously to preserve our country for our children, 
and their children, and their children's children before it is too 
late.

at the request of the leader, I want to share my thanks, my 
appreciation--truly, my appreciation--for an action that the House just 
took up.
  It was just about an hour or so ago that the House took up the bill 
that we had passed out of the Senate here, our lands and water 
conservation bill, which was a very significant measure of about 120 
different conservation, lands, waters, and sportsmen's bills--all 
rolled into one package--that passed out of here by 92 to 8. It just 
passed out of the House by a significant, significant margin.
  It is, I think, a real testament not only to the work that has been 
done within this body on a very strong bipartisan basis but, really, to 
the work that we have done with the House, in our working with the 
other body in a bipartisan, bicameral way. I think it goes a long way 
to showing that we really can come together as a Congress on issues 
that are important to each of us individually.
  I give my thanks and my appreciation to Chairman Grijalva, to Mr. 
Bishop, who was the former chairman of that committee and who worked on 
this with us last year, and to all of their teams, as well as to the 
House leadership, which has helped to advance this to this moment in 
time.
  We look forward to the President's signing that very, very shortly, 
and I know that it will come as a real positive moment for so many. I 
thank all who helped us with this.

374,S. 311,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgS1447-5,0,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Senate had an opportunity 
yesterday to affirm our commitment to the dignity of human life. We had 
a chance to state plainly that newborn babies who happen to have 
survived abortions are entitled to the same legal protections and 
professional care as other newborns.
  In all honesty, the fact that this legislation even needed to be 
written is a sad reminder of the degree to which our society is at risk 
of losing some crucial moral bearings, and the fact that the U.S. 
Senate could not even vote to advance this bill is beyond dismaying.
  The legislation was silent on the abortion issue. All it would have 
done is to have affirmed the rights of these newborn babies, but 
apparently even that was a bridge too far, not just for the far-left 
fringe--not anymore--but for the vast majority of our Democratic 
colleagues right here in the Senate.
  We are no longer dealing with a normal, traditional Democratic Party; 
we are looking at a party that has been dragged so far to the left, it 
would have been unrecognizable to folks just a few years ago. In 1996, 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan condemned partial-birth abortion by 
comparing it to infanticide. He was a distinguished, mainstream 
Democratic Senator from New York about 20 years ago. And today? Ninety-
four percent of Senate Democrats could not even vote to protect babies 
after they are born. The only explanations they could offer were 
bizarre euphemisms and vague references to issues that have no bearing 
once a child has already been born alive.
  It was a sorry display, but I can say this: This fight isn't over. 
The Republicans will not let this stunning extremism from our 
Democratic colleagues be the last word on this subject.

  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 145, providing for consideration of H.R. 8, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act of 2019.
  The rule provides for consideration of each bill under a structured 
rule. The rule also provides 1 hour of general debate on each bill 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary.
  The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 and the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act of 2019 arrived at a time of emergency for 
America--a real emergency. Every year 120,000 Americans are shot in our 
country, and 35,000 of them are shot dead. Seventeen thousand of the 
people wounded or killed each year are children or teenagers, their 
families devastated, their lives forever changed.
  In 2017, gun deaths in America hit the highest level in 40 years, 
with 40,000 Americans killed.
  We have lost more Americans to gun violence in our own communities 
than to the Vietnam war, the Revolutionary


War, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean war, the Iraq 
war, and the Afghan war, combined. This war at home never stops. Each 
day--yesterday, today, and tomorrow--another 100 people in America are 
shot and killed by gun violence.
  Mr. Speaker, this is not a global problem; it is an American problem. 
While 35,000 Americans are killed by gunfire here each year, it is 146 
people in the United Kingdom, 142 in Portugal, and 30 in Japan.
  We lose more people to gun violence in a single weekend than England 
loses all year. We lost more people in the Las Vegas massacre alone, in 
one bloody night, than the nation of Japan lost to gun violence in 8 
years.
  No other developed, high-income country's lethal gun violence even 
comes close to the American carnage allowed by our loophole-ridden gun 
laws. The gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times 
higher than the average of other high-income countries and hundreds of 
times higher than some of them.
  Now, the good news is that we know what to do to begin to end this 
crisis. We must close the loopholes.
  In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act went into effect 
and required licensed firearm dealers to contact the FBI to run a 
background check through NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System.
  The Brady Act made it illegal to sell a firearm to felons, to 
fugitives, to people who had been committed to mental institutions, to 
drug addicts, to domestic abusers, to undocumented immigrants, and to 
other disqualified categories.
  The Brady Act worked as far as it went. It stopped more than 3 
million illegal purchases of firearms by convicted felons, violently 
abusive partners, fugitives, the mentally ill, and so on. But there are 
gaping loopholes in the law because unlicensed gun sellers, the people 
who sell guns online today or at gun shows or in other private 
transactions, can sell firearms without having to run any background 
check whatsoever.
  More than one-fifth of U.S. gun owners acquired their most recent 
firearm without any background check at all, which means that millions 
of people obtained millions of firearms without going through the Brady 
system, and people who commit gun crimes overwhelmingly obtain their 
firearms from the unlicensed sources. A 2013 study found that 80 
percent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes were obtained 
from sources that were not required to go through the background check.
  The criminals are not stupid. They follow the loopholes. They go to 
the internet. They go to the gun shows. They go to the convenience 
store parking lots to get their weapons of mass destruction without any 
background check at all.
  Our legislation will close these dangerous loopholes by guaranteeing 
that there is a thorough NICS background check on every gun sale or 
transfer, with only a few carefully defined exceptions for intrafamily 
gifts and a few other cases.
  Mr. Speaker, there are three primary things you need to know about 
this legislation:
  First, it is backed by more than 90 percent of the American people--
fully, 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun owners, 97 
percent of Republicans, and 99 percent of Democrats. It is the very 
essence of common sense, the sense we all have in common, to make the 
background check system comprehensive and universal, leakproof, 
foolproof, and not ridden by the loopholes.
  A background check doesn't work if criminals know that there are 
massive and lawful ways to cheat and get around it. So America, today, 
stands up to close the loopholes, and that is why this is a day of 
great triumph for the gun safety movement that has swept America in 
response to Parkland, Las Vegas, Newtown, and the other massacres that 
our people have endured.
  Second, this legislation is perfectly constitutional. As Justice 
Scalia found for the Supreme Court in the District of Columbia v. 
Heller decision, the Second Amendment permits reasonable regulation to 
exclude from gun ownership violent felons, the mentally unstable, and 
so on.
  Despite all of the solemn invocations of the Second Amendment that we 
continue to hear bouncing off of the walls of Congress, the opponents 
of this legislation could not muster a single witness to actually argue 
that this legislation is unconstitutional, and that includes the George 
Mason University Antonin Scalia School of Law professor of 
constitutional law and the Second Amendment who was brought in and just 
expressed her policy misgivings about the bill without articulating any 
constitutional analysis at all and rejected the opportunity to say that 
this legislation is unconstitutional.

  The reason 97 percent of Americans favor this legislation is because 
it is perfectly consistent with the letter and spirit of the Second 
Amendment, and it sweepingly advances public safety at the same time.
  Third, this bill will dramatically lower gun violence in America. 
More than 90 percent of Brady background checks take less than 90 
seconds to complete. But these checks have literally stopped more than 
3 million illegal gun purchases by felons, fugitives, domestic 
offenders, the violently mentally ill, undocumented aliens, and so on. 
Every day, background checks stop 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers 
from purchasing a gun. Imagine how much more effective this system will 
be when we close these gaping loopholes.
  Yet, even in the face of the shocking death toll which distinguishes 
our society from the other wealthy societies on Earth, despite the 
overwhelming public support for this legislation, and despite its clear 
constitutionality, our friends across the aisle oppose closing the 
internet, the gun show, and the private sale loopholes.
  Instead of getting on our side to close the loopholes, what do they 
give us? More loopholes. They brought us dozens of amendments to try to 
suggest more loopholes to the current law.
  That is obviously not the direction that America needs to go in, and 
you will hear some more about that today, Mr. Speaker. They have given 
us a veritable loophole factory. But now is the time to close 
loopholes, not reproduce them.
  Let's focus on the public safety, which is the cardinal purpose of 
law in the social contract in a democratic society. Let's pass this 
excellent bill, and let's pass H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background 
Checks Act of 2019, which closes the Charleston loophole, the loophole 
that made it possible for a guy to go out and get a gun because the 
dealer decided to give him a gun after 3 days because they were still 
doing a background check.
  This loophole says that if it has taken 3 days or more, you have a 
right to go ahead and get your gun. We are going to close that one, the 
so-called default proceed provision. We are going to close that one, 
too, so that we don't see any repeat massacres like the one that took 
place in June of 2015 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church 
in Charleston, South Carolina.
  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.",R000606,2019-02-26
381,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1112, ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2119,6,Mrs. LESKO,"  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, 
and I thank Mr. Raskin for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.
  Mr. Speaker, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, want to reduce gun 
violence. I think there is just a difference of opinion on how we get 
there.
  Unfortunately, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, although well-intentioned, will 
not reduce gun violence as Mr. Raskin said, and instead it will turn 
everyday, law-abiding individuals into criminals and could actually do 
more harm than good.
  I grew up in a family that didn't have guns. After my dad returned 
from World War II, he stopped hunting. So, because I wasn't around 
them, I have to admit I had an irrational fear of guns for awhile. It 
wasn't until I became an adult that I got educated.
  I remember I first went to a debate where the person who was talking 
for gun rights said: Do you know who follows the laws? Law-abiding 
people follow the laws. Who doesn't follow the laws? Criminals do not 
follow the laws.
  So although well-intentioned, often laws are unenforceable, and 
criminals just do not follow them.
  H.R. 8, again, I believe is well-intentioned. But it will not solve 
the problem. H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the mass shootings 
in the last 20 years, not one of them.


  I studied them because I am on the Judiciary Committee along with Mr. 
Raskin, and we heard this bill in that committee. In most cases, guns 
were obtained legally. Recent attackers have passed background checks 
to acquire their firearms, including the attackers at the Thousand 
Oaks, California, shooting; the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania shooting; the attacker in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School, Parkland, Florida, shooting; the shooting at the Pulse 
nightclub in Orlando, Florida; and the Las Vegas, Nevada, shooting. 
None of these attacks would have been prevented if H.R. 8 or H.R. 1112 
were law.
  Then, the attackers in the Columbine High School Colorado shooting 
used straw purchasers for their weapons, an act that is already illegal 
and has been illegal since at least the 1960s.
  Adam Lanza, the attacker in the Sandy Hook Elementary School, 
Newtown, Connecticut, shooting used his mother's firearms which were 
legally purchased by his mother. So as you can see--and I have each one 
of them listed how the attackers got their guns--H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 
would not have prevented any of these shootings.
  Not only would none of the mass shootings be prevented by H.R. 8 and 
H.R. 1112, but the Department of Justice under President Obama said 
that in order for universal background checks to actually work and be 
enforceable, a Federal gun registry is needed. Yet this legislation in 
H.R. 8 specifically prohibits a registry; thus, again, it is 
unenforceable.
  The fact is criminals don't get their guns legally and will not go 
through a background check to get their guns even if this bill were 
signed into law.


  A recent Department of Justice report of prison inmates that used 
guns in their crimes showed that 56 percent obtained their guns 
illegally and another 25 percent received them from family members--
which, by the way, family members are still allowed to get the guns 
under this law.
  It is obvious, then, that they did not get their guns from a gun show 
or private sales, as Mr. Raskin is concerned about.
  H.R. 8 will also turn everyday, law-abiding citizens into criminals 
if it becomes law.
  Let's look at the amendments that were rejected by the Democrats in 
the Rules Committee and in the Committee on the Judiciary that offered 
to protect law-abiding citizens from becoming criminals.
  First, there was an amendment--I thought commonsense--that someone 
thinking of committing suicide would be exempted from temporarily 
turning over their gun to a friend, and it is not allowed under this 
bill. They would become a criminal.
  So, somebody who wants to commit suicide could not transfer their gun 
to someone else.
  If a law-abiding citizen wanted to let someone temporarily use their 
gun on their own property, they would become a criminal under this 
bill.
  If a farmer or rancher wanted to temporarily lend a gun to a ranch 
hand for the purposes of ranch activities, the farmer would become a 
criminal under this law.
  If a domestic violence victim was in fear for her life and wanted to 
temporarily borrow a gun from a friend to protect herself, she would 
become a criminal under this law.
  Let's also look at some commonsense amendments rejected by the 
Democrats that would have prevented undue burdens and duplication on 
law-abiding citizens who have already passed a background check but now 
have to go through another background check under this law.
  People who have security clearances. This is the application to get a 
government security clearance, page upon page, background check, 
extensive background check. Yet, someone who has this and has gone 
through this still has to get another background check.
  People who have a concealed carry weapon issued by a State, they have 
to go through another background check.
  People who have already gotten a gun permit from States which require 
them; they have to go through another background check.
  People who have global entry, who have gone through a background 
check, they have got to do it again under this bill.
  Even law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers have to go 
through another background check under this bill.
  This is placing undue burden on law-abiding citizens.
  Now I want to share testimony from a young woman from the Judiciary 
Committee. This woman was a victim of rape on her college campus. And 
the reason I am bringing it up is because well-meaning gun control laws 
actually prevented her from carrying a gun to school because the State 
she traveled through did not allow her to carry a gun in order to 
defend herself.
  This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens--not criminals, 
law-abiding citizens--who follow the law and how this young woman and 
others like her were actually harmed by well-intentioned gun control 
laws.
  As a survivor of domestic violence, I know all too well how hard it 
can be to protect oneself or find a lifeline out. My abuser often 
controlled all my finances. I wouldn't have been able to pay for a 
background check or a gun.
  Sometimes getting a gun from a friend could actually be your only 
option; yet, unfortunately, under this bill, I tried to offer an 
amendment, but it was rejected.
  Now let's turn to H.R. 1112, which changes the length of time that a 
background check has to be completed from the current 3 days to 10 
business days and then another 10 business days for an appeal. So it 
could be 20-plus days.
  The reason I am bringing this up is I want to tell you a story--a 
real story--about Carol Bowne. She was a New Jersey woman who was 
stabbed to death while waiting to be approved for her firearm 
application.
  She already had an order of protection through the courts, but that 
wasn't enough. She needed more than just that piece of paper.
  H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the 
country, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger. 
Women who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a 
month--20 days to a month--like Carol. How many women will potentially 
suffer like Carol?
  H.R. 8 also has other problems.
  Unfortunately, the debate in the Judiciary Committee was cut short. 
Many commonsense amendments were not even heard. Only 10 amendments out 
of 100 were heard before the chairman cut off debate.
  Because of the rush to get this bill through, there is another 
problem. There is vague language that is not defined and, thus, is open 
to interpretation.
  I know, in some of the amendments, the majority party has tried to 
give an alternative to my good, commonsense domestic violence 
amendments, but it doesn't do any good. And this is the reason; it is 
because the language is so vague.
  It says: Under H.R. 8, a person is allowed to temporarily transfer a 
firearm if it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily 
harm.
  The question is: There is no definition of this, so how long is a 
temporary transfer? Who determines that? Does the victim determine it?
  Who determines if there is imminent death? Does it qualify if a 
victim of domestic violence thinks they will be killed? Or does the 
person transferring the gun have to be in the same room and there be 
some kind of shootout and they throw a gun to them?
  What do ``imminent danger'' and ``imminent death'' mean?
  With something as important as the Second Amendment, I think we owe 
it to the American people to do our work and take as long as we have to 
in order to have a fair and open debate on major pieces of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.",L000589,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement by the National Task 
Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence, which is in favor of this 
legislation and against any weakening amendments.

         National Task Force To End Sexual & Domestic Violence

       The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic 
     Violence, a coalition comprising federal, state, local and 
     tribal organizations and individuals who have fought for


     federal protections for survivors of domestic violence, 
     dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, oppose any 
     amendments to H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 
     2019, that exempts any persons from the firearms background 
     check requirement. This includes amendments exempting victims 
     and survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault, 
     including those with protective orders.
       Firearms pose a significant danger to victims of domestic 
     violence, and this is true no matter who owns the firearm. 
     Research shows that a male abuser's access to a firearm 
     increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold and 
     does not support the contention that firearm possession is a 
     protective factor for the victim. The testimony of Christy 
     Salters Martin, a professional boxer and experienced gun 
     user, to the Senate Judiciary Committee illustrates this. 
     Despite her boxing prowess and familiarity with firearms, her 
     abuser was able to take her gun from her and shoot her with 
     it, narrowly missing her heart. Firearms do not make victims 
     of domestic violence safer; firearms put victims at greater 
     risk.
       Furthermore, domestic abusers are adept at using the 
     justice system against victims. Abusers often accuse the 
     victim of being the perpetrator of violence, making police 
     reports and seeking protective orders. Abusers are also adept 
     at finding loopholes. If persons with protective orders are 
     exempted from the background check requirement, many abusers 
     who are prohibited from possessing firearms would seek 
     protective orders in order to circumvent the background check 
     requirement to obtain firearms to terrorize their victims.
       Moreover, requiring a victim to undergo a firearms 
     background check is not a hurdle to obtaining a firearm. Most 
     firearm background checks are completed in under a minute. A 
     victim seeking to purchase a firearm would still be able to 
     do so quickly, unless the victim was legally prohibited from 
     possessing firearms.
       Rather than adding dangerous exemptions to a law that is 
     supposed to protect victims and survivors of domestic 
     violence, Congress should focus on ensuring that adjudicated 
     domestic abusers do not possess firearms. This includes 
     ensuring federal firearms prohibitors protect all victims of 
     intimate partner violence, including dating partners, and 
     ensuring that domestic abusers who are prohibited from 
     possessing firearms relinquish their firearms. The best way 
     to protect victims is to disarm abusers.

significant danger to victims of domestic violence, and this is true no 
matter who owns the firearm. Research shows that a male abuser's access 
to a firearm increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold 
and does not support the contention that firearm possession is a 
protective factor for the victim.''
  And there is more in here of interest.
  I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for her 
thoughts on the question of sexual and domestic violence.
  We, indeed, have a provision within the legislation which allows for 
an exemption from the background check requirement in cases of an 
imminent threat of great bodily harm.
  The question has been raised: Does that include sexual assault, 
dating partner violence, stalking, and so on? We thought it was self-
evident that it did, but, in any event, Representatives Horn from 
Oklahoma and Murphy from Florida are introducing a clarifying amendment 
to be very specific that it is included.
  At that point, perhaps we could welcome the support of the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona, because we are being very clear 
at that point that our exception for imminent bodily harm and violence 
includes sexual assault and so on.
  I am certain that the gentlewoman's intentions are good, just as are 
the intentions of the offerers of the amendment in the bill.
  Let me just address, in case the gentlewoman hasn't decided to come 
over to our side now, some of the general points that were made against 
the legislation.
  The gentlewoman articulated an argument we have been hearing a lot of 
from our counterparts, which is that criminals don't follow the law 
and, therefore, there is no reason to get rid of the loopholes and 
strengthen the law, because criminals won't follow the law.
  Now, the fallacy of that argument is plain to see. It is an argument 
against all law.
  It is an argument against the law against murder because murderers 
obviously don't follow the law against murder.
  It is an argument against the law opposed to theft because thieves 
don't follow the law against theft.
  But I think anyone who takes time to really study what law is 
understands that the purpose of the law is to deter people from 
negative, socially harmful action, the way that the Brady Act has 
deterred more than 3 million people--felons, fugitives, the mentally 
unstable, and other unauthorized categories--from accessing a weapon.
  Now, that argument sweeps so broadly that it is an argument against 
having the Brady Act that we have now, and perhaps that is the 
intention, simply to take down the law that we have got now.
  Another purpose of law, of course, is to punish people who violate it 
and then, again, to send a moral message about what the social norms 
are.
  And we have got social norms about driving, for example. Would we say 
we are not going to have driver's licenses in America because people 
who drive without a driver's license ignore the law requiring you to 
have a driver's license?
  It is a completely nonsensical argument.
  Let's come back to reality and talk about what the Brady Act actually 
requires the gun dealers to ask people.
  Here are the basic questions that are being asked:
  Are you under indictment for or have you ever been convicted of a 
felony?
  Are you a fugitive from justice?
  Are you an unlawful user of a controlled substance?
  Do you suffer from mental illness?
  Have you been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces?
  Are you subject to a court order restraining you from harassing, 
stalking, or threatening your child or an intimate partner?
  Have you ever been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic 
violence?
  Have you renounced your United States citizenship?
  Are you unlawfully present in the United States?
  Mr. Speaker, those questions have created a dragnet that has allowed 
us to stop more than 3 million people from getting weapons who 
shouldn't have them.
  But there are these big, gaping loopholes out there that they can go 
on the Internet and get one, or they can go to the parking lot of a 
convenience store in a private sale and get one, or they can go to a 
gun show and negotiate a private sale and get one without having to 
answer those questions.
  Well, the American people have spoken on this. That is really why 
this is the first legislation advocating gun safety to hit the floor of 
the House of Representatives in a quarter of a century.
  This is a great day for the gun safety movement that has overtaken 
America, rejecting the unconscionable toll of 100 people dead every 
single day in communities across the land.

held 54 moments of silence, but we have not held one moment of action.
  With Speaker Pelosi's leadership, we now have a chance to vote for 
two--two--bipartisan bills which will help save lives.

to H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.


  We all share the same goal: to end gun violence. But in the course of 
this debate, House Democrats say they want to do something to end gun 
violence and anyone who disagrees with their policies doesn't care.
  I believe in my heart that the gentleman from Maryland and the folks 
on the other side of this debate care about the victims of gun violence 
and the children in this country, and I know in my heart that my 
colleagues on this side of the aisle and I care, too.
  It is a shame that in their rush to do something, anything, Democrats 
have made this a partisan show. They won't even allow my bipartisan 
concealed carry reciprocity bill that passed this House last Congress 
to be debated on the House floor today.
  What about the single mother victim of assault, like Shaneen Allen? 
Does she not have the right to defend herself?
  Instead of working on commonsense solutions that can actually help 
prevent tragedies--like supporting local law enforcement, ensuring laws 
and protocols are followed, improving mental health, and implementing 
my concealed carry reciprocity--they are targeting law-abiding 
citizens, and they are disregarding existing Federal law.
  There is no gun show loophole. Federal law already requires a 
background check on every commercial gun purchase in America no matter 
where it takes place. Federal law already prohibits so-called straw 
purchases.
  Let's make one thing clear: H.R. 8 would not have stopped Newtown. 
H.R. 8 would not have stopped Parkland. It would not have stopped Las 
Vegas or Sutherland Springs or San Bernardino or the tragic attack on 
our former colleague, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.
  But the proponents of gun control don't want you to judge them based 
on outcomes; they want you to judge them based on intentions. And they 
say anyone who points out the facts, anyone who dares observe the 
obvious flaws in their legislation, does so because they don't care.
  In their rush to do something, House Democrats ignore that House 
Republicans have done many things, like strengthening the background 
check system, which would have prevented Sutherland Springs; improving 
mental healthcare, which would have prevented many of these shootings 
such as Newtown and Charleston and Parkland; and giving schools the 
tools they need to protect students. All these bills received 
bipartisan support in the last Congress, but we don't get credit for 
real action because they say our intentions weren't good enough.
  We owe it to the American people to look past the intention and the 
emotion and focus like a laser on outcomes. What can we do to actually 
end gun violence once and for all?
  So what is this bill actually going to do?
  It is going to turn a law-abiding American into a criminal when you 
loan your shotgun to your buddy to go dove hunting.
  It is going to make it illegal for a victim of stalking to borrow a 
gun from a neighbor for protection.
  It is going to make the cost of background checks so expensive that 
the average American can't afford to buy a gun. Meanwhile, criminals 
are going to continue to get their firearms, whether it is through 
theft or the black market or on the street.
  I applaud President Donald Trump for standing with us against this 
ineffective legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  The American people want us to work together to solve this problem 
and stop gun violence. Can't we come together in a bipartisan way and 
not just do something, but do something that will actually make a 
difference?
  I am calling on my colleagues to put partisanship aside. Work 
together on ideas that will actually make a difference. I stand ready 
to continue this work. I will work with anyone to end gun violence 
while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens, and I reject 
the false dilemma that we can't do both.",H001067,2019-02-26

  I suppose that we are in a rush to do anything, something, anything 
that works in order to curb the terrible toll of gun violence on our 
society.
  In the last Congress it is true there was other legislation that was 
brought to us. One was a proposal to legalize silencers in America, 
which sounds to me more like an agenda of organized crime than it is of 
the U.S. Congress trying to seek public safety.
  But there was this bipartisan Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which 
was a massive assault on federalism and States' rights. It would have 
destroyed every State's concealed carry law in the country to a level 
at the lowest common denominator. So if you could get a license to 
carry a concealed loaded weapon in one State--and in some States there 
are more than a million people who have been able to get them through 
completely permissive and lax laws--then you could go anywhere in the 
country. That is their proposal. That is what is coming out of the 
loophole factory.
  I just would like to assure my friend that we have a provision in our 
legislation, if you read it carefully, which says that you can 
temporarily transfer a gun at a shooting range, at a shooting gallery, 
or for purposes of hunting, so he doesn't have to worry about this.
  Our friends are either not reading carefully enough or they are 
overlooking very clear passages in our legislation which deal with 
commonsense concerns.
  This is bipartisan legislation. It is backed by more than 90 percent 
of the American people, and it is going to advance common safety. So 
rather than searching for mysterious reasons to oppose it, why 
shouldn't everybody get together to say this is something that will 
promote the public safety?

Castor).",R000606,2019-02-26

Committee for yielding the time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and H.R. 8, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. I am proud to be a cosponsor, 
and I thank Congressman Thompson for his leadership.
  Our bill is intended to ensure that individuals who are prohibited 
from owning a firearm are not able to possess one.
  Representative Raskin is right. America is in the midst of a gun 
violence emergency. Each year, 120,000 Americans are injured by a 
firearm; 35,000 Americans die; and of those, 17,000 who are injured and 
killed are children.
  No other country in the world suffers the ravages of gun violence, 
and I am afraid we have become numb to it. But we don't have to accept 
it, and we are not, because we are going to finally pass legislation 
here today.
  Mass shootings are on the rise. Military-style assault weapons are 
deadlier than ever. People are being gunned down in churches, schools, 
movie theaters, nightclubs, and synagogues.
  For so many years, the Republican-led Congress blocked action on 
commonsense gun safety laws. But, finally, to the American people: We 
heard you; to the students who marched for their lives: We are finally 
going to act.
  It is time now. I urge adoption of this bipartisan bill, the rule. It 
is a vote for the safety of our communities and our families.",C001066,2019-02-26
389,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1112, ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2119,14,Mrs. LESKO,"  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a couple of things that were 
said previously.
  I had sponsored an amendment, as a survivor of domestic violence, to 
allow victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse who have orders of 
protection to be able to get transferred a gun if they might be in fear 
for their life.
  As I have said, often victims of domestic violence don't have the 
financial means or they are so restricted by their perpetrator that it 
is difficult for them to go out and purchase a gun, let alone get a 
background check, and so they might have a friend whom they can borrow 
it from.
  Now, in response, I think, Mr. Raskin, if I am not mistaken, said 
that the Democrats did help domestic violence victims. I just don't 
think that their amendment cuts it, and I am going to read the 
amendment if this is the one that the gentleman is talking about.
  It says: A temporary transfer that is necessary to prevent imminent 
death or great bodily harm, if the possession by the transferee lasts 
only as long as immediately necessary to prevent the


imminent death or great bodily harm--and then here is the amendment--
including the harm of domestic violence, dating partner violence, 
sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.
  I would say just because you add the words ``domestic violence,'' 
``victims of domestic abuse'' doesn't mean this is going to help; and 
the reason is simply because of what I said before, that these terms in 
here are really unclear. I really would like somebody to explain, and 
they are not defined anywhere, who determines prevent imminent death or 
great bodily harm?
  So, let's say I am a victim of domestic violence and I think my 
perpetrator is going to kill me. Does imminent death and, in this word, 
say, last only as long as immediately necessary to prevent the imminent 
death? So does that mean the person who--my friend who can lend me a 
gun has to be right there in the same room and see that there is 
imminent death coming?
  I mean, there is no definition here. So it is unclear to me that this 
would help at all.
  Also, what is the definition of ``temporary transfer''? How long is 
that? How long is temporary transfer? Does that mean, you know, just 
enough time you can throw somebody a gun while they are imminently in 
death? I mean, do you have to be right there? What does this mean? 
There is no definition.
  So, if we are going to proceed with this, I think that we should at 
least define what these terms mean. Therefore, I really wish that my 
amendment that said that victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse 
that have an order of protection through the court--through the court--
would be allowed to at least borrow a gun to defend themselves from, 
maybe, a friend.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",L000589,2019-02-26
390,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1112, ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2119,15,Mr. RASKIN,"  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I want to thank my colleague for advancing our discussion here 
because I think now we are really starting to get somewhere.
  The gentlewoman suggested an amendment which allows for the transfer 
of a firearm to a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault who has 
an order of protection issued by a court. That is an extremely narrow 
exception.
  Most women who are enduring domestic violence don't have a civil 
protection order. Part of that is because of the incompetence of the 
laws in a lot of States, and part of it is because they haven't had the 
wherewithal to go and get one.
  But our legislation and our amendment sweeps much more broadly. It 
allows any woman who is a victim of domestic violence, who faces a 
threat from their attacker, to be loaned a gun by a family member or be 
loaned a gun by a friend until the threat is resolved.
  My friend suggests that there is something ambiguous about the words. 
I just don't see the ambiguity. Their original argument attacked the 
utility of all criminal law, saying we shouldn't have criminal laws, 
essentially, because criminals won't follow them.
  This seems like an attack on law itself. Law depends upon language. 
But the language is clear here that if there is a threat and if you are 
suffering from the threat of domestic violence, sexual assault and so 
on, then you can get the gun.
  Who interprets it? Well, you have got the right to go out and get it. 
If someone were to prosecute you for doing that, the prosecution would 
clearly lose.
  So I am afraid that our friends are looking for problems in this 
bipartisan legislation which simply don't exist.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Jackson Lee).",R000606,2019-02-26
391,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1112, ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2119,16,Ms. JACKSON LEE,"  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member on the Judiciary 
Committee and senior member on the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland 
Security Subcommittee, I, too, am glad of the underlying discussion 
regarding the protecting of women.
  I rise today to support H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act 
of 2019, to close the gun show loophole, supported by 80 percent of the 
American people, so unlicensed dealers cannot, undercover, out of the 
back of their trunk, sell to people who would create and perpetrate 
either mass murders or individual abuse and gun violence.
  I also support H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, 
that would, in fact, have stopped the deaths at the Mother Emanuel 
Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where worshippers were shot down, 
nine of them.
  To listen to the debate in the Judiciary Committee, 10 hours of 
rebuffing these simple legislative initiatives, I beg of my colleagues 
to stand with us. It is clear that we have an amendment, Horn and 
Murphy, that clarifies great bodily harm, includes domestic violence, 
dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse. 
We want women to be protected and others involved in domestic abuse 
circumstances.
  My amendment that will be brought up as well will provide the 
information as to how many times the FBI has had to deal with petitions 
that have been denied.
  Let us not have another 20 years before we have bills that deal with 
gun safety legislation. Let's do it now.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule governing debate on 
H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019'' and H.R. 1112, 
the ``Enhanced Background Check Act of 2019,'' as well as the 
underlying legislation.
  These legislative proposals address and strengthen the background 
check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.
  A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms 
acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not 
required to run a background check, and that 96 percent of inmates who 
were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they 
committed their crime obtained their gun this way.
  This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not 
conduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers 
sell a large number of guns.
  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make 
it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, 
manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who 
is not so licensed without a background check.
  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be 
required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary 
background check before the transfer could be finalized.
  H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy manner to ensure 
firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.
  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
demonstrated that NICS background checks are approximately 99.3 percent 
to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed 
within 90 seconds.
  H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would 
strengthen the background check procedures federal firearms licensees 
or dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.
  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a 
background check on prospective buyers using the NICS.
  Over 90% of checks are completed within 90 seconds so if the NICS 
system has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer 
within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition 
with the Attorney General for review.
  After another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms 
dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if 
it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer 
has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from 
obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.
  Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or 
transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days 
have passed, since the initial background check.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding effective action to 
reduce, if not prevent altogether, the countless mass shootings and gun 
violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.
  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and 
Prevention found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight 
year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.
  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that 
there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more 
than 2015.
  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 
11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.
  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and 
violence deterrence.
  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355 
mass shootings in 2018.
  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School 
in Newtown,


Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.
  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, 
with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.
  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large 
crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las 
Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.
  And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First 
Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-
old Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 and injured 20 others.
  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, 
resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.
  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--
as much as 114 percent higher than other States.
  A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
looking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent 
increase in a State's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent 
increase in its firearm homicide rate.
  Gun death rates are generally lower in States with restrictions such 
as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.
  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.
  Because more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings 
between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is 
needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.
  And that begins with passing H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act of 2019,'' and H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Check 
Act of 2019.''
  I urge all Members to support the rule and the underlying legislation 
when it comes to the floor.",J000032,2019-02-26
392,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1112, ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019",CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2119,17,Mrs. LESKO,"  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I would like to refute some of the things, or talk about some of the 
things said by my friends on the other side.
  One of the things that I do want to talk about is that Mr. Raskin 
said that my amendment is such a narrow exception for domestic violence 
victims. I had a broader one in Judiciary Committee, if the gentleman 
remembers, and Chairman Nadler told me that it was too broad, that it 
was too vague, so that is why I made it very specific.
  If the gentleman would like, I will make it broad again.


  Also in the Rules Committee, there was another amendment as well, and 
we are both on Rules, too, of course.
  There was a broader one from Mr. Scalise, who is a victim of gun 
violence. He had an amendment that was ruled out of order. That 
basically said any victim of domestic violence, which was broad, but 
then he had another subsection that said victim of domestic violence or 
sexual abuse that has an order of protection. So we covered both, yet 
it was ruled out of order. So we really tried.
  Now, the other thing that you brought up, that it is very clear what 
imminent danger means, and that would cover somebody, and surely a 
domestic violence victim would not become a criminal under this law. 
Well, I don't think it is very sure.
  So I ask Mr. Raskin, my colleague, if he would be open to removing 
the word ``imminent'' and just say ``danger,'' instead of ``imminent 
danger,'' because to me, ``imminent danger'' means you have to be right 
in the same room, you know, and throw somebody a gun or something. I 
mean, to me, the word ``imminent'' needs to be removed from the 
language.
  The other thing I would like to talk about is the number of times now 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: Oh, so many 
people support this universal background check.
  Well, I disagree. I disagree, because there is proof right in Maine. 
They had a ballot measure, and it was rejected by the majority of the 
people.
  I suppose it depends on how you ask the question, but I just don't 
think that when you get into the details of how it takes away our 
fundamental Second Amendment rights and actually burdens law-abiding 
citizens and actually may harm people, some of these laws--like was the 
case with the young woman who testified in Judiciary who said that 
good-intentioned gun laws actually prevented her from defending 
herself, and she was raped.
  So I would say I have some disagreements with some of your 
statements.
  I also want to point out that there are many things that we can do on 
a bipartisan basis, and this obviously is not bipartisan. I am a co-
chairwoman of the Women's Caucus in Congress, and I have talked to my 
counterpart, a very nice woman and Congresswoman. We really do want to 
work on bipartisan solutions to gun violence. I would say one of those 
is let's really concentrate on mental health issues.
  Now, we have done some things in the past. We did the Fix NICS Act, 
which we passed last year on a bipartisan basis, which really is an 
attempt to fix the national background system so that local 
jurisdictions actually report when there are problems, which I think is 
very valuable.
  We also did legislation in a bipartisan manner that would protect our 
schools more.
  Here is another thing we could do in a bipartisan manner. As you have 
noted, 3.5 million people have been stopped by NICS since 1994 from 
getting guns, and 112,000 were stopped just last year. But you know 
what? Only 12 of those 112,000 were actually prosecuted. Why? I mean, 
we have laws on the books now, and we are not even enforcing them. So I 
think that is another thing we can do on a bipartisan basis.
  Again, this bill, I believe, does more harm than good. I do think my 
colleagues are well intentioned. I do believe that all of us, whether 
we are Republican or Democrat, want to reduce gun violence.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",L000589,2019-02-26

consume.
  Mr. Speaker, first, to clarify one thing, this is bipartisan 
legislation. We have at least five Republicans who are cosponsoring and 
supporting this legislation. I assume my friend doesn't mean to read 
those five Republican Members of the House of Representatives out of 
her caucus.
  I am not quite sure what happened in Maine, but I know that there are 
around a dozen States and the District of Columbia that have already 
gotten rid of the loopholes that we are going to get rid of today in 
this Federal legislation.
  My friend also invokes Second Amendment rights. I thought that we had 
put that red herring to rest in 2008 in Heller v. District of Columbia. 
Justice Scalia said that reasonable regulation to screen out felons and 
fugitives and the mentally unstable is perfectly consistent with the 
Second Amendment.
  Everybody on both sides of the aisle favors the Second Amendment, 
along with the rest of the Bill of Rights. If you are going to oppose 
this legislation, you have to base it on some public safety rationale 
and not pretend like anybody has made a constitutional argument, 
because nobody has made a constitutional argument.
  Finally, on the question of the domestic violence amendment, I would 
invite my friend to come on over, and we would gladly have unanimous 
consent to have her added to the amendment, which is the broader 
amendment she is talking about. Of course, her amendment was the narrow 
one, which required you to have a civil protection order before there 
would be an exception from the provisions of the legislation.
  She said she was misdirected by the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee. All I can say is the legislative process is a treacherous 
place and a rocky road for people in the minority. I have been dealing 
with that for several years. In any event, we would love to have you 
join the amendment now. Mr. Speaker, I make that offer to my friend.

Raskin) for yielding me the time, and I thank him for his leadership on 
this important issue.
  Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are 
opposing this legislation that people are watching this debate, and I 
know many are scratching their heads wondering what is going on, 
because what we are trying to do here is close loopholes that allow 
violent criminals to get access to guns, not create more loopholes.


  Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, I spoke at a town hall sponsored by 
students at Bancroft High School in Worcester, Massachusetts. Those 
young people demanded action on gun violence, not unlike other young 
people all across my district and all across this country. They are 
terrified, and they are tired of seeing one massacre after another 
after another after another. They are sickened by the unacceptable high 
rate of gun violence in this country.
  We have an obligation to be on their side, not on the side of the gun 
lobby.
  In fact, most gun owners agree with what we are doing here today. 
Ninety-seven percent of gun-owning households support universal 
background checks. You don't see support like that on very many things, 
but on this issue, the public is speaking loud and clear. The question 
is whether Congress is going to listen.
  My office has been flooded with calls on this year after year after 
year, and I have heard from loved ones of victims killed and from those 
injured. I know many of my colleagues can say the same thing. It is 
heartbreaking.
  Each of us is in a unique position. We can do more than just listen. 
We can act. We can actually vote to help save lives.
  Sadly, past majorities have turned a deaf ear. In fact, it has been 
nearly a decade since the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on a major 
bill to combat gun violence. When they were in charge, my Republican 
friends on the other side instead held a hearing on a bill that would 
have actually brought more guns from out of State into local 
communities.
  Their indifference on this issue of gun violence, their silence, has 
been stunning. But this majority is not satisfied with inaction. We 
will not be cowed by the gun lobby.
  We are moving legislation, in the case of H.R. 8, that has been in 
the works for more than 20 years. The time for inaction is over.
  Listen to the young people in your districts. They are not content 
with a future where gun violence is the norm. They want and they 
deserve better.

pass exception after exception after exception.",M000312,2019-02-26

yielding and for his tireless leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and H.R. 8, 
Congressman Thompson's bipartisan bill that makes gun sale background 
checks universal.
  This bill is an important step to ensure that individuals who should 
not be allowed to purchase a gun are no longer able to purchase a gun.
  Since 2014, nearly 400 of my constituents have died by gun violence. 
Our community feels their loss every single day. Here are just a few of 
their names and tragic stories.
  Davon Ellis: Davon was a star football player and an excellent 
student at Oakland Tech High School. He was shot and killed while 
walking home from school. My nephew was walking with him when he was 
gunned down.
  Travon Godfrey: Travon was killed in 2016 while sitting in a car with 
his friends in front of his home. Every time I think about Travon, my 
heart breaks. Travon came to a town meeting that I held on gun violence 
in January of 2016.
  Sadly, these heartbreaking stories are all too familiar in 
communities across the country. More than 30,000 Americans lose their 
lives to gun violence each year. Shootings now kill as many Americans 
as car accidents, and that is why this bill is so important.",L000551,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good first step to ensure that our 
background checks are strengthened, that we keep guns out of the wrong 
hands, and that we close these loopholes.
  Mr. Speaker, we must end this epidemic of gun violence in our 
country. This is a national emergency. This bill will save lives, so I 
urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and ``yes'' on the bill.",L000551,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an 
amendment to the rule to make my amendment in order, which would allow 
domestic violence and sexual assault victims with orders of protection 
to be exempt from the gun transfer prohibitions. This amendment 
is crucial to saving lives.

  As a survivor of domestic violence, I know what it is like to be in 
fear for our lives.
  This commonsense amendment is clearcut. If you are a victim with an 
order of protection, you can borrow a firearm or transfer a firearm to 
you. It is important, because victims don't often have the means to 
purchase or go pay for a background check.
  The Democrats have presented a letter from the National Task Force to 
End Sexual and Domestic Violence as a reason for not needing my 
amendment. However, with all due respect, the National Task Force does 
not speak for every victim, and they certainly do not speak for me. In 
fact, they never even contacted me, and I have been an outspoken person 
saying I am a survivor of domestic violence since I ran for Congress. I 
am also the person who sponsored the amendment to extend the Violence 
Against Women Act, yet they have never talked to me or reached out to 
my office.
  The majority offered a political amendment on domestic violence, 
which I have already talked about, which really does not do any good, 
because the definitions of imminent danger are not defined, and it will 
not be carried out and will not be effective.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous question.",L000589,2019-02-26

violence in the United States, but H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 will not solve 
the problem.


  As co-chairwoman of the bipartisan Women's Caucus, I am committed to 
working across the aisle on solutions we can all agree on. However, 
this is not one of them. We can talk about mental health. We can talk 
about strengthening the NICS background check system even more. We can 
talk about enforcing the laws that are already on the books.
  H.R. 8 will turn law-abiding citizens into criminals by making 
everyday gun transfers a crime and putting those who seek to protect 
themselves in jail for wanting to do so.
  H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 will place an undue burden on citizens who 
already have a background check. For instance: security clearance, 
global entry, State-issued permits, et cetera.
  These pieces of legislation put law-abiding citizens in danger by 
disarming them and emboldening criminals. The bad guys never follow the 
law. In fact, I believe that this legislation violates the Second 
Amendment of the Constitution because it does not prohibit undue fees 
for background checks and, thus, some people cannot afford them


and, thus, not be able to get a gun to defend themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the 
underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.",L000589,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, far from trying to turn law-abiding citizens into 
criminals, our legislation will save law-abiding citizens from 
criminals, simply by expanding the successful Brady law, which has been 
in effect for decades now.
  The gentlewoman introduces a constitutional argument at the last 
minute here, saying that our legislation is unconstitutional because 
there may be undue fees imposed. Of course, those are the fees that are 
currently imposed under the Brady law, so I am afraid that my friend 
has just made an argument for the unconstitutionality of the current 
law, which has saved us from more than 3 million felons, fugitives, 
mentally unstable people, drug abusers, and undocumented aliens from 
acquiring firearms in the country.
  Mr. Speaker, our country is a social contract. I know we have got a 
lot of young people here today. We are a social contract. If you go 
back and read any of the social contracts--there is Thomas Hobbes, John 
Locke, or Thomas Jefferson--any of them say, we leave a state of 
nature, which is a state of war and a state of violence, in order to 
live in a civilized way.
  But how civilized is it when tens of thousands of Americans, every 
year, are being killed in firearm violence? Every day, another hundred 
Americans are killed with guns.
  In 2017, the highest level in 40 years, nearly 40,000 Americans died 
from gun violence. That is not a civilized state. That is a state of 
war. That is a state of violence.
  We know what the loopholes are, and we are going to close the 
loopholes with our bipartisan legislation, which has support from 
Republicans and it has support from Democrats. The public opinion polls 
show that more than 95 percent of the American people support what we 
are trying to do here--close the gun show loophole, close the private 
sale loophole, close the internet loophole--make sure that everybody 
who purchases a gun in America is purchasing it only with the universal 
comprehensive mental and criminal background check.
  We have amendments for the discrete exceptions that are necessary, 
including in cases of imminent violence, including rape and sexual 
assault via domestic violence. We think that this legislation is 
excellent legislation that every Member of Congress should feel proud 
voting for.
  Mr. Speaker, I submit both H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Check 
Act, as well as the bill to close the Charleston loophole, so that 
criminals are not given guns after 3 days. We are able to delay that 
process in the event that more investigation is needed.",R000606,2019-02-26

the rule providing for consideration of the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 8) and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 
2019 (H.R. 1112).
  These critical bills would ensure that there is a comprehensive 
background check on every firearm purchase, something that 97 percent 
of American voters, including 97 percent of gun-owning households, 
support.
  H.R. 8 requires background checks on all firearm sales, including 
those conducted by unlicensed gun sellers, closing what has become 
known as the ``gun show loophole.''
  H.R. 1112 closes another loophole in current statute that allows gun 
dealers to transfer a firearm after three business days if they have 
not received a definitive response from the background check system.
  Tragically, this gap became known as the ``Charleston loophole'' when 
it contributed to the brutal murder of nine people at the Emanuel 
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in 2015.
  Congress must act immediately on the ABCs of gun violence prevention.
  A is for Assault Weapons Ban.
  B is for Background Checks Reform.
  C is for Closing the Gun Show Loophole.

417,IN APPRECIATION OF ED CANNADY UPON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgE209-6,0,Mr. SIMPSON,"  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure and a little 
sadness that I rise today to recognize Ed Cannady and the great service 
he has given to our country, conservation and recreation as he retires 
from the United States Forest Service.
  One of the great aspects of serving in Congress is meeting people, 
and Ed will be one of the individuals I remember most. Over the years, 
Ed has been a guide, a teacher and a friend to me and my staff.
  I first met Ed in the early 2000s when I began working on my Boulder-
White Clouds Wilderness bill. I thought it would be important to get a 
first-hand look at the lands I would be proposing for wilderness 
designation so I asked the Sawtooth National Forest Supervisor to set 
up a backpacking trip for my staff and me.
  It was my good fortune that Ed was given the assignment to take a 
Congressman and his staff into the Boulder-White Clouds. I'm not


sure that Ed thought the same. He decided we would hike to the foot of 
Castle Peak in the Chamberlain basin. It was the middle of August--
summer mind you--and when we got our tents set up that afternoon it 
began to snow. It snowed more and blew some and snowed more. When we 
woke the next day to a winter scene and the chance of even more snow, 
prudence dictated that it was time to pack up and go home early.
  While it was a short trip, it made for a great story and was the 
first of many enlightening trips and learning experiences into what is 
now the Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness that Ed took us on.
  I also want to give special recognition to Ed for the help and 
expertise that he provided me and my staff as we developed the Boulder-
White Clouds and Jerry Peak wilderness package. As far as I know, there 
is only one person alive who has been through and over every acre of 
those mountains and it happens to be Ed.
  As we were determining wilderness boundaries, roads, trails, creeks, 
snowmobile areas and helicopter landing and ski areas, Ed was the one 
person who could always give me the answers I needed. More importantly, 
I could always count on Ed to give me both sides of the issue in an 
impartial manner that was fair to all parties.
  He also identified potential conflicts for me with boundaries and 
uses so that we could resolve problems before they were locked into 
legislation. I can say with confidence that it would have been very 
difficult to write the bill without his help and expertise and for that 
I want to say ``thank you Ed.''
  Ed Cannady is one of the good guys and my staff and I are going to 
miss him. Fortunately, we know he's not really going away and we will 
keep in touch in the many years to come.
  Good luck and enjoy your retirement Ed

419,EMERGENCY DECLARATION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2106-2,1,Mr. ARRINGTON,"  Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the 
resolution the House will vote on later today that would terminate the 
President's declaration of a national emergency.
  The need to secure our borders isn't just a matter of good public 
policy, it is our highest calling, and it is our constitutionally 
prescribed duty as guardians of our citizens' safety.
  When our Founding Fathers penned our Constitution and changed the 
course of history, they charged the Federal Government in the preamble 
with the preeminent responsibility to provide for the common defense. 
But they didn't just stop there. They went on and not only empowered, 
but they commanded that the Federal Government shall protect every 
State in the Union against invasion.
  Madam Speaker, unfortunately, as the American people and, especially, 
the citizens of the great State of Texas know far too well, the Federal 
Government has abdicated its most important responsibility and has been 
derelict in its constitutional duty to defend our borders and provide 
for our defense.
  For too long, politicians have pontificated and they have postured 
that they would stop illegal immigration and that they would secure the 
border, but the fact is they haven't. Anyone who has been to the border 
or worked along the border or lives along the border knows that this is 
a crisis. This is a national emergency.
  We know that, just last month, apprehensions at the southern border 
spiked 84 percent compared to the same time last year, with 120,000 
apprehensions in the last 2 months alone. Homeland Security personnel 
spent 28,000 man-hours to render basic medical services to folks who 
were coming across the border.
  New migrant caravans continue to form and march toward our cities


along the border where our Border Patrol agents are already overwhelmed 
with migrants from other caravans.


  And in the first caravan of 8,000 people that forced their way into 
Mexico--they forced their way into Mexico--where they should have 
stopped as the first safe country when they were applying for asylum, 
we know that 600 of that first caravan of 8,000 were known criminals.
  Additionally, because of our porous borders, drugs continue to flood 
into our country, poison our communities, and destroy our families.
  Just last year 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in this 
country. Ninety percent of those drugs are coming from across the 
southern border. If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is.
  No one is on the front lines of this fight more than the State of 
Texas. Since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with more 
than 290,000 crimes in Texas alone.
  When you combine the total cost of illegal immigration from 
healthcare services, education, and incarceration, it is over $12 
billion for the State of Texas. It is over $150 billion for the United 
States.
  We are $22 trillion in debt. We will have two of our biggest safety-
net programs insolvent in less than 20 years, and we are spending $150 
billion on illegal immigration.
  We know that constructing physical barriers, when combined with boots 
on the ground and technology, are effective at stemming the tide of 
illegal immigration.
  We know walls work because we have seen it when we have deployed them 
in El Paso, San Diego, and Tucson, and we have stopped illegal 
immigration or stemmed the tide 90-plus percent.
  So, instead of letting this crisis continue to worsen, this President 
took action, using authority not that he invented but that we in 
Congress explicitly gave him under the National Emergency Act.
  It is not like the President is setting new precedent or breaking new 
ground. Other presidents have declared national emergencies 50-plus 
times, and I know President Clinton declared it a national emergency to 
fight drug traffickers--rightfully so--and President Obama against 
transnational criminal organizations.
  This President loves this country. He wants to do his job. He doesn't 
want another one of our sons and daughters to die of drug addiction or 
overdose. He doesn't want crime to run rampant in the streets of the 
United States.
  The President understands his first job as Commander in Chief is to 
keep our citizens--our people--safe, and I stand with him.
  Madam Speaker, today I will be voting for our President, for his 
constitutional, legal authority to defend this country, to protect our 
borders and our citizens. I will be voting for the safety of the 
American people today and the safety of our communities, not just in 
west Texas but throughout this country.
  Again, President Trump is doing the right thing. He is doing the 
responsible thing. He is doing the constitutionally necessary thing. 
And I am behind him 100 percent.

427,WILDERNESS CONSERVATION,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2108-3,1,Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana,"  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss concerns 
with S. 47, legislation we will soon be voting on in the House of 
Representatives.
  Madam Speaker, S. 47 has some positive things in it. The legislation 
provides for expanded recreational opportunities, expanded 
opportunities to hunt and fish on our public lands, and a lot of things 
that I very much support.
  Madam Speaker, the bill has some pretty profound flaws, one of which 
being process. This is a 700-page bill--a 700-page bill--that has been 
held at the desk. It has not gone through the regular committee 
process.
  This isn't some small bill that folks have been exposed to. This is 
700 pages of text, and it has not gone through the regular legislative 
process and, in fact, is being put up under suspension of the rules, 
where we are not even being provided the opportunity to offer 
amendments or to represent our constituents, other than just voting 
``yes'' or ``no.''
  Madam Speaker, I want to throw out some statistics on what this bill 
does and the implications. It provides 1.3 million acres of land being 
designated as wilderness areas--1.3 million acres; 694 acres of 
recreation and conservation areas; 370,000 acres of mineral 
withdrawals; national monument designations of 2,500 acres; 621 miles 
of wild and scenic rivers; 2,600 miles added to the national trail 
system; and 42,000 acres added to our national parks.
  Now, Madam Speaker, I used to teach outdoor wilderness courses. I 
have spent hundreds, maybe even thousands of nights of my life in the 
outdoors, sleeping out in the wilderness areas, national parks, and 
national forests and others. I love these areas. I enjoy them.
  I am not saying that these things shouldn't happen. I am saying that 
we need to have the ability to go through regular order, just like the 
Senate did this week when they had the ability to offer amendments to 
this bill. We are not being afforded that same opportunity.
  Madam Speaker, my biggest problem or concern with this legislation is 
this: The bill permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, which, I will say it again: I support the acquisition of lands, 
the protection of lands, so we can enjoy the ecological productivity 
and enjoy time in the great outdoors. However, the bill does not 
address the fact that we have a $17 billion backlog in national park 
maintenance--$17 billion. So we are acquiring more land without a plan 
for addressing the existing backlog maintenance issues that actually 
prohibit or prevent people from enjoying some of these same lands that 
are being acquired.

  We are talking about the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and $9 
billion in funds over the next 10 years being deposited into a Treasury 
receipt account to acquire more land. Guess where this money is coming 
from, Madam Speaker. A hundred percent of these funds is coming from 
the State that I represent and the other five States that produce 
offshore energy. Every penny of it is coming from the State of 
Louisiana, which produces perhaps over 80 percent of all the offshore 
energy of this Nation in Federal waters. It is paying for this fund.
  At the same time, we have lost 2,000 square miles--2,000 square 
miles--of our coast. Guess how much of this bill addresses the problem 
there? With 2,000 square miles of our coast disappearing, the 
ecological productivity being lost, the increased vulnerability to the 
people that I represent, zero, nothing. This bill diverts money for 
conservation and for protection in other States in other areas and does 
nothing for my home State of Louisiana, yet it is coming from our 
revenues that we are producing in our offshore.
  This is a flawed process. This is a flawed bill. We need to go 
through regular order.
  I really can't even believe that this is happening. Here we have 
dozens of hearings on climate change and other things, and the very 
State that is the canary in the coal mine, the State that is 
experiencing the worst ecological challenges or losses as a result of 
sea rise and other challenges, is being completely ignored.
  Where are the climate change advocates right now? Where are you?
  I strongly urge opposition to this bill. We need to go back through 
regular order, consider the largest conservation and the largest 
natural resources bill that we have had since I have been in the 
Congress, and send it through regular order again.
  I urge opposition to this bill.

legacy of the late Monsignor Robert T. McDermott of the City of Camden, 
Camden County, located in the First Congressional District of the Great 
State of New Jersey, for his decades of public service.
  Monsignor McDermott was born July 19, 1942 in the City of Camden and 
attended Saint Joseph's Pro-Cathedral School and later attended Camden 
Catholic High School.
  In 1969, Monsignor McDermott was ordained into the priesthood. He 
then became the pastor at Saint Joseph Pro-Cathedral for thirty years 
and went on to serve as Vicar General for the Diocese of Camden.
  While ministering to the poor and diverse immigrant community, 
Monsignor McDermott recognized the needs of the community and assisted 
in the facilitation of opening several nonprofits including the Joseph 
Fund.
  The Joseph Fund assists other nonprofits with fundraising and 
obtaining resources, such as; Saint Joseph Carpenter Society, which 
improves affordable housing, Saint Joseph Child Development Center, 
LUCY Outreach, supporting youth through after-school tutoring, 
mentoring and trauma-informed care, Joseph's House of Camden, aids the 
homeless, offering emergency shelter, supportive housing and social 
services, as well as the Romero Center, committed to ending poverty and 
discrimination throughout the world.
  In the community he both loved and called home, Monsignor McDermott 
served with compassion and distinction. The Monsignor was a role model, 
extraordinary public servant, a tireless advocate for others and will 
be deeply missed.
  Madam Speaker, I ask you to join with me in mourning the loss and 
honoring the legacy of the late Monsignor Robert T. McDermott.

  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today on behalf of a 
significant bipartisan benefit for conservation in the United States.
  S. 47, the lands package, is the product of many months of 
negotiation and many years of committee process.
  The bill benefits all Americans.
  By protecting ecosystems, preserving our cultural heritage, and 
connecting the people to their lands, we demonstrate this Congress' 
commitment to public lands that serve all Americans.
  I am particularly proud that this package will permanently authorize 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that supports 
recreation access and conservation in all 50 States.
  LWCF works for the people at no direct cost to the taxpayer. It 
enhances Americans' enjoyment of public lands across this Nation. It is 
time to guarantee the future of this very important program.
  In addition to LWCF, the package would add over 1 million acres of 
wilderness, designate new national monuments, and expand three national 
parks, to name a few of the over 100 provisions.
  I am proud to support LWCF; I am proud to support S. 47; and I hope 
my colleagues will similarly support this bipartisan effort.
  I want to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow collaborators on the 
legislation: Congressman Bishop and Senators Murkowski, Manchin, and 
Cantwell. Their willingness to work and to compromise was crucial in 
turning this bill into a reality. I congratulate them on their efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",G000551,2019-02-26
437,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT ACT,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2141-2,6,Mr. BISHOP of Utah,"  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, when I became chairman of this committee, I vowed never 
to do this kind of a package. I thought that each bill deserved to be 
debated and to be moved as a standalone.
  Basically, we in the House did that. Unfortunately, the Senate did 
not, which is why there are at least 63 House-passed bills in this 
package, 62 of which were passed on suspension, that have been sitting 
in the Senate, languishing for up to a year and a half.
  If somebody says they don't have time to look at all the stuff that 
is in here, there have been months that they have been able to look at 
this stuff as it has been sitting over in the Senate.
  Much of it is of parochial significance, which means it solves local 
challenges.


  The very basis of all the bills that are in here is to put people 
above government. If indeed we are going to have public lands, there 
should be access to those lands.
  That is one of the reasons why, for the first time in years, we have 
had some sportsmen's activities that are put into this particular bill. 
So the sportsmen can assume if they are on public land, it is going to 
be open for recreational hunting and fishing and shooting and all kinds 
of outdoor recreation, unless it is specifically closed.
  And a land manager cannot be arbitrary with that. If they are going 
to close it, there has to be a public process they go through that 
mandates consultation with local officials.
  It is extremely important that bow hunters get some protection. Even 
duck hunters get some certainty in here. For the first time, we are 
going to have special days for duck hunting, for youth and veterans, as 
well as those who are on Active Duty.
  For the first time, there are real reforms of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. When that program was established a half century 
ago, 60 percent of all the land was supposed to go into the State and 
local funds.
  Those are the programs that your constituents are calling you and 
saying: These are the good things on why this program should be 
reauthorized.
  But when that cap was taken off, the amount of money going to State 
and local programs was reduced. In the time of the Obama 
administration, it was down to 12 percent. Everything else was for land 
acquisition.
  This bill reforms that permanently by saying no less than 40 percent 
has to go to those State and local funds that your constituents like.
  No less than 3 percent has to go to fulfilling facility recreation 
access. That means that we are, for the first time now, really 
empowering people and communities, State and local governments, as well 
as sportsmen.
  I have always said that I want to shrink the Federal estate. This 
bill finally does shrink the Federal estate, in my State as well as 
nationwide.
  We create four new monuments in this bill, but the right way; not 
expecting the President to make a declaration but, actually, for the 
Congress to pass a bill, to debate the bill, and then to pass the bill 
at the same time.
  This administration actually did use the Antiquities Act on one of 
these monuments--nice and cute--but we are going to do it the right way 
in this particular bill.
  We are going to do wilderness the right way. No longer should an 
agency simply create wilderness by dicta or fiat. Congress will make 
those decisions of what is wilderness and what is not going to be 
wilderness.
  Let me talk for just a second about wilderness, because it has some 
controversy in here.
  Over half the wilderness that is established in this section of bills 
is in my home State of Utah, but, as Mr. Curtis will tell you, the 
county commissioners, the local officials, endorse this action. They 
are happy with it because they gain access to other areas that can 
promote recreation and economic development, which they have been 
trying to get for several decades.

  A quarter of this is also in California, in one district. So we 
create wilderness in the national park, but, at the same time, we are 
taking wilderness study areas and releasing those at the same time. We 
are making exchanges so that some of the lands go into trust funds for 
education purposes, to fund the education of our kids--something that 
the East doesn't need, but those of us who live in the Federally 
controlled West, we desperately need to do that.
  For the first time we are taking EAJA, and we will actually have some 
transparency so we will really know what it costs for environmental 
litigation.
  These are all issues we have been talking about for years in the 
House. These are issues that we repeatedly passed in the House. But, 
for now, we have a chance of actually making it happen.
  Is this bill perfect? No. It is too big to be perfect.
  Is the process for creating this perfect? Hell, no. But I am 
perfectly satisfied and willing to vote for this, because without this 
there will be no progress. The status quo will be maintained, and that 
is bad.
  Senator Graham used to say: If I am going from Washington back to 
Houston and I get as far as Memphis, that is not bad. If I end up in 
Boston, it is bad, but for Memphis, that is not necessarily bad.
  We have been complaining for years about elements that are in this 
package of bills, and now we have a chance to actually be positive, to 
get to Memphis and beyond, and to actually get something done.
  And if someone says: ``It is not good enough; I am holding out for 
something better,'' we are holding out for something that never has 
been and never will be.
  And it puts to the lie the complaints that we have exaggerated in the 
past. Congress is finally ready to act.
  We should not refuse the solutions that are in front of us right now. 
This is a step forward, and this, obviously, is better than the 
alternatives.
  I urge adoption of this package of compromise bills that have been 
worked out in advance, and I appreciate my colleagues on the Democratic 
side who have worked so hard to try and come up with a package of bills 
that we can all support.

Chairman Grijalva for their work on this legislation.
  This is a proud moment. We listened to a lot of angst a while ago, 
and now we look at two people working together to solve a problem. This 
is how Congress should work.
  I am especially proud of this legislation because, as the chairman 
mentioned, there are 62 pieces of legislation that passed this House 
that are in this bill somewhere, including five which are mine.
  I think it is important to the State of Alaska. What this bill does, 
as mentioned by the chairman and the past chairman, is gives 
opportunity to everybody to be involved. As the chairman said, it may 
not be everything we want. I had a couple of things we didn't get in 
it, but this is the beginning of working together on public lands as 
they should be, with those that are directly involved in it.
  The legislation that was in this bill that was mine: There was the 
Alaska Native veterans and selection of lands--first time. Been trying 
15 years, and we finally got it done.
  It also has and expands the long overdue sand and gravel mineral 
rights to Alaskan Natives in Barrow. A lot of this land surrounds 
Native villages, so this legislation solves a lot of those conflicts. 
And everybody supports it.
  I am very excited about this legislation. I want to thank my senators 
for working on it and finally getting it done but, most of all, the 
committee, the Natural Resources Committee, where I was chairman for 6 
years. This is a good piece of legislation, and I urge passage of this

environmentalist, and a conservationist to support S. 47.
  I want to thank my home-State colleagues in the Senate; of course, my 
friends from the other side of the aisle; and, most importantly, our 
chairman, Chairman Grijalva, for his leadership with respect to this 
bill.
  In the great State of Colorado, we understand the value of our public 
lands. Our State's outdoor recreation economy brings in $28 billion and 
$10 billion in workers' wages alone.

  Investing in our public lands, conserving our wild places, is good 
for our economy, and it is good for our future generations.
  I am proud that this bill not only includes nine measures that would 
impact my State, but two provisions, in particular, that I introduced 
earlier this Congress that directly benefit Colorado's Second 
Congressional District.
  First, the Bolts Ditch Access and Use Act is an important provision 
that allows the town of Minturn, in Eagle County in my district, water 
access with use of the Bolts Ditch headgate.
  Secondly, the WEDGE Act incorporates 124 acres of land adjacent to 
Rocky Mountain National Park into Arapahoe National Forest.
  I am excited to take up both of these provisions on the House floor 
today, both of which will have a real local impact on the communities 
that I am so honored to represent in Colorado's Second.
  Not only this, but, of course, S. 47 provides permanent authorization 
of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is long overdue and a 
milestone for future generations.

forward to continuing to work to conserve our public lands.",N000191,2019-02-26

important package, S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act.
  This bill is comprised of dozens of smaller bills, including two that 
I have had the opportunity to sponsor: the Emery County Public Land 
Management Act and the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act.
  The Emery County bill has been a locally driven effort and will bring 
long-term certainty to the area through various designations and 
expanding Goblin Valley State Park for better management. It will also 
generate millions of dollars for Utah school kids through the School 
Trust Land Exchanges.
  Also in this package, the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension 
Act will ensure access to critical water sources and continue to 
promote the recovery of four endangered species.
  There are many, many who deserve praise for their years and decades 
of work on these bills. I would especially like to thank Republican 
leader Bishop, who has been invaluable in pushing these bills across 
the finish line and, on a personal note, has mentored me through very 
difficult public lands issues.
  Especially today, I would like to give appreciation and recognition 
to Emery County commissioners, who had the ability to see into the 
future to understand how important this was for their county and to 
work through all the difficult issues.
  Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Democratic side 
of the aisle for their willingness to work with me, to see this through 
our eyes and to explain this through their eyes. I am grateful for the 
friendships and relationships that I have developed through this 
process.

bipartisan public lands package. This broad, sweeping legislation is 
important because it includes provisions that will permanently 
reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but it will also 
designate over 1 million acres of wilderness on Federal lands in States 
across the West, including over 300,000 acres in California alone.
  The bill also includes the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver 
Act, or the WILD Act, a bill I am proud to colead in the House with my 
Alaska colleague, Representative   Don Young.
  The WILD Act reauthorizes the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, 
as well as the Multinational Species Conservation Funds, which will 
include dedicated funds for rhinos, for tigers, for great apes, for 
marine turtles, as well as for African and Asian elephants.
  The WILD Act will also expand the Marine Turtle Conservation Fund to 
include tortoises and freshwater turtles, establishing a new source of 
funding for these priority species.
  As we all know, over 60 percent of these 330 modern species are now 
either threatened, are endangered, or, unfortunately, are now extinct.
  The WILD Act will also protect ecosystems and wildlife from invasive 
species through the development of strategic plans for reducing 
invasive species populations on land or water managed by Federal 
agencies.
  Finally, the WILD Act also includes a newly created Theodore 
Roosevelt Genius Prize, a concept that will encourage innovation in 
wildlife conservation, combating wildlife trafficking and poaching, 
protecting endangered species, as well as other areas.
  The WILD Act, and S. 47 more broadly, will help wildlife and land

Springs Battlefield National Monument Act, which is included in this 
great package before us today. And he did it the right way, Mr. 
Speaker.
  The nonprofit Mill Springs Battlefield Association has worked 
tirelessly for nearly three decades to preserve and maintain more than 
900 acres to honor and commemorate the first major Union victory in the 
Civil War, even constructing a 10,000-square-foot visitor center and 
museum at the site where the national cemetery is located.
  I was proud to introduce legislation that would add this historic 
battlefield in Kentucky's Wayne and Pulaski Counties to the national 
park system. Enactment of S. 27 today will ensure that this national 
treasure is protected, preserved, and promoted well into the future.
  I, therefore, urge your support.
  And especially to Mr. Bishop, who, over the years, as chairman of the 
committee, worked with us in great detail on this project, I want to 
especially say my thanks to Ranking Member Bishop and the committee.",R000395,2019-02-26

today in support of S. 47. This bill represents a major victory for 
conservation, and I want to congratulate the chairman and his co-
drafters on its success.
  In my home State of New Mexico, new protections in the Organ 
Mountains, the Cerros del Norte, and San Juan County will add over 
250,000 acres of new wilderness, the highest conservation protection 
this Congress can bestow.
  These lands will preserve our ecosystems, protect access to clean, 
consistent water flows, and help our State to begin to adapt to the 
realities of climate change.
  By permanently authorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, S. 
47 will help my home State and every State in this Nation, and I 
strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''",H001080,2019-02-26

over to the dark side and is now former chairman somewhere else.",B001250,2019-02-26
453,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT ACT,CREC-2019-02-26-pt1-PgH2141-2,22,Mr. WALDEN,"  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, as the top Republican on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, I enjoy the relationship and camaraderie I have 
with the Natural Resources Committee, and I want to thank the gentleman 
from Utah and my friend Mr. Grijalva, the chairman of the committee for 
once again bringing this measure forward affecting Crooked River Ranch.
  The Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act is essential to saving 
lives in central Oregon. With another wildfire season just on the 
horizon, the people of Crooked River Ranch are really deeply concerned 
that they could become the next Paradise, California, and they are 
deeply concerned that their community could be turned into ash as 
wildfire feeds off the dense fuel loads that surround this community of 
5,000 people.
  They are there because of a lack of proper management to thin out the 
fuel loads because this area is in a wilderness study area. What we are 
doing is moving the boundary back about 800 acres. So at the BLM, it 
will all stay public. The BLM can come in and use mechanical treatment, 
literally, to reduce juniper and sagebrush so that the firefighters can 
come in and fight fire if they do get one.
  We know what happens in this kind of terrain, the tragedy, the loss 
of life, loss of homes, the loss of community. There are 5,000 people 
out on a rim, if you will, in a canyon with only one way in and one way 
out. The fire chief has told me that if fire breaks out and it is the 
wrong kind with enough wind, he might not put his firefighters in 
there. So today we are going to save lives, thanks to your work.

  Harry Ward, the fire chief, said this ``has created a dangerous 
environment and continues to threaten the people that live here.''
  This legislation will adjust that WSA. The important public safety 
legislation will give peace of mind to the residents of Crooked River 
Ranch.
  Last year, a fire only a few miles away burned 2,000 acres. It 
destroyed two homes in less than a day. The next fire season is not far 
away. We do not want to see images like this of homes turned to ash and 
lives destroyed in central Oregon, where we have a real opportunity to 
prevent that from happening thanks to this bipartisan legislation.
  So I want to thank my Senators who worked on this. I want to thank 
Mr. Grijalva and Mr. Bishop for their work on this, and I appreciate 
its being brought in as part of the package of bills that now will go 
to President Trump, who I am convinced will sign it into law.",W000791,2019-02-26

yielding and for his leadership on this issue.
  I rise in strong support of S. 47, the Natural Resources Management 
Act. And as my colleague from Utah so eloquently stated, this landmark 
public lands legislation is the product of years, decades of work at 
the committee level, and months of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. 
It includes support from key conservation, sportsmen, and environmental 
stakeholders.
  The outstanding provisions in this bill will enshrine and safeguard 
our Nation's conservation legacy for decades to come. This begins with 
permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It 
should never have expired. Permanent reauthorization of LWCF will mean 
this program and its important work can continue unimpeded for future 
generations.
  Almost 20 years ago, John Dingell led the first effort to permanently 
reauthorize it with his friends   Don Young, George Miller, Billy 
Tauzin, and Chris John, a geographically and diverse group of leaders 
who happened to like the outdoors and, yes, hunting and fishing.
  LWCF funding has protected some of our country's most treasured 
natural resources, while creating jobs, supporting local economies, and 
providing countless opportunities for recreation. Since 1965, LWCS has 
provided over $3.9 billion for over 40,000 projects in every county 
across this country, with every $1 invested returning $4 in economic 
value.
  This benefits every congressional district, every county, and every 
State in this country. Preserving our beautiful and iconic places 
matters to us all and was the reason for initially starting it.",D000624,2019-02-26

the Natural Resources Management Act.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill signifies a strong bipartisan consensus and 
commitment to protecting our Nation's public resources, including 
parks, wildlife, habitat, and access to the outdoors.
  Today's vote will help preserve thousands of acres of public land so 
that Americans can visit, explore, fish, hunt, and enjoy wildlife in 
the outdoors for generations to come.
  I am particularly proud of the measure which will provide long-term 
sustainability of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am also proud 
to see the important sportsmen's titles included in this bill that will 
expand access for recreation, fishing, and hunting on public lands.
  I would like to thank Ranking Member Bishop and Chairman Grijalva for 
their tireless work to help make this bill a reality.
  As a lifelong sportsman and supporter of our Nation's refuges, parks, 
and public lands, I urge every Member of this body to support this 
legislation so that we can provide permanent stability for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund to improve access for sportsmen and to conserve 
wildlife habitat for future generations.",W000804,2019-02-26

Congressional District, a district that is home to over 50,000 square 
miles of geographically diverse land, including several national 
monuments and parks, I am proud to voice my support for the Natural 
Resources Management Act.
  As we have heard, this bill permanently reauthorizes the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, an integral conservation program that has 
provided the State of Nevada with $40 million for investment in local 
parks and another $60 million to benefit our public lands.
  Moreover, this bill expands access to outdoor recreation 
opportunities for communities across America. Outdoor recreation is a 
vital aspect of Nevada's economy. In 2017, it supported nearly 90,000 
jobs, contributed $4 billion in wages, and spurred $12 billion of 
consumer spending in our State.
  I am proud to vote for this bill to expand outdoor recreation 
opportunities, particularly for our underserved communities, many of 
whom depend on Federal funding to develop parks and recreation.
  As the 116th Congress continues, I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to develop 
conservation programs that work for all of America.",H001066,2019-02-26

ranking member for bringing this package today, and the bipartisan work 
that we are advocating for here on the House floor.
  I rise in support of this important bill for two reasons, two reasons 
directly related to western North Carolina, where I am honored to 
represent.
  First, it has a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. This is a very important program that uses offshore 
energy


resources to fund protected lands that are of national importance: our 
rivers, our scenic byways, our lakes. Clean water in western North 
Carolina, access to the great outdoors has been a great driver of our 
economy, and LWCF has helped fund the preservation and protection of 
those areas.
  Second, I stand in support of this important bill because it 
reauthorizes the Blue Ridge National Heritage Area.
  These two pieces of legislation, the LWCF reauthorization, and the 
Blue Ridge National Heritage Area, are two items that I have sponsored 
independently of this package, and I am glad they are a part of this 
resolution before us.
  The Blue Ridge National Heritage Area ensures the preservation of the 
unique cultural history of western North Carolina and provides access 
to our land surrounding the Blue Ridge Parkway.
  So those two important areas are just a small part of this larger 
package that has been hammered out in a bipartisan way. I commit it to 
my colleagues, and I ask for a ``yea'' vote.

yielding to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 47. In addition to permanently 
reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is, of 
course, critically important, this bill also establishes a memorial for 
the St. Francis Dam disaster. This memorial is a project that has been 
a priority for my hometown, the city of Santa Clarita, for many years, 
and the site is just miles from where I grew up and where my sister now 
lives.
  The St. Francis Dam was an integral part of our city's water 
infrastructure back in the 1920s. On March 12, 1928, the dam failed, 
and the resulting flood killed over 450 people, cost millions of 
dollars, and destroyed many homes and other property. The collapse of 
the St. Francis Dam is considered one of the worst civil engineering 
failures of the 20th century and is the second deadliest disaster in 
California history.
  I am proud that, in the 116th Congress, we will finally be able to 
magnify the stories of this tragedy and provide a constant reminder of 
how critical infrastructure is to the safety and security of our 
communities.",H001087,2019-02-26

Grijalva.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise enthusiastically today to support this package 
that the House is considering. It includes one of my bills, the Yakima 
River Basin Water Enhancement Project Phase III Act. This legislation 
authorizes the next phase of the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan, which is 
a decades-long effort to address the vital water needs of the ag 
community, conservationists, and certainly my constituents throughout 
the Yakima Basin.
  Mr. Speaker, I have not only worked on this project for the last 
three Congresses, but I hate to say it, my efforts go back even 
further, almost 30 years, more than I would like to admit, as a farmer, 
former State legislator, and as director of the State department of 
agriculture. Today demonstrates the closest we have ever come to 
sending this crucial legislation to the President to sign into law.
  I firmly believe that the Yakima Workgroup and the Implementation 
Committee are a model for the rest of the Nation to follow to address 
divisive issues. I invite all of my colleagues to come see for 
themselves. This group represents a diverse array of local, Tribal, 
State, Federal, ag, environmental, and private interests. They have 
worked through decades of painstaking compromise, collaboration, and 
efforts to find solutions.
  So I rise to thank all of them for their hard work, all of the Tribal 
leaders, the State-Federal partners, the commissioners of the counties, 
conservation organizations, the cities, local irrigation 
representatives, and certainly the Natural Resources staff who have 
worked very hard on this all along, including Mr. Bill Ball. Without 
their hard work and deep commitment to addressing this comprehensive 
issue, we would not be as close as we are today to getting this crucial 
step done.

sides of the aisle for this package of legislation that we consider 
today.",N000189,2019-02-26

bill.
  I particularly appreciate its inclusion of a provision originally 
authored by my predecessor, Niki Tsongas, to add the Nashua River to 
the Wild and Scenic River System.
  Seeking this designation has been a labor of love for the communities 
in the watershed and local leaders like Marion Stoddart and Elizabeth 
Ainsley Campbell.
  I also value the bill's funding cap adjustment for Essex National 
Heritage Area.
  Finally, it is outstanding to see the bill's renewal of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, a program that has benefited nearly every 
corner of the Nation, including Minute Man and Lowell National Parks in

this lands package.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member 
for their bipartisan work on this important bill.
  Our public lands define our Montana way of life. Three principles 
guide my approach: conserve our public lands, increase public access, 
and trust our local communities.
  These principles guided me to protect the gateway to Yellowstone 
National Park. I met with the residents and community leaders, and the 
consensus is clear: They don't want mining in Paradise Valley. That is 
why I introduced the legislation to permanently ban mining on 30,000 
acres of public land just outside Yellowstone Park. That measure is 
included in this package today.
  This package also permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund.
  Susan and I raised our kids hunting, fishing, and backpacking on our 
public lands in Montana, and I know how critical LWCF is to Montana.
  Permanently protecting the gateway to Yellowstone and permanently 
reauthorizing LWCF will help preserve and expand public access to our

Resources Management Act, a bipartisan package that includes my bill, 
the Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
  This legislation would designate over 21 miles of the Molalla River 
as wild and scenic, a Federal designation that will permanently ensure 
its protection and preservation as one of Oregon's many national State 
treasures.
  The idea to designate the Molalla River as a wild and scenic 
recreational river was initiated over 12 years ago by Molalla residents 
who were looking to preserve and protect their river. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to acknowledge and thank these community partners, chief among 
them the Molalla River Alliance, American Rivers, Molalla River Watch, 
Northwest Steelheaders, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and 
the city of Molalla.
  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the efforts of a few key 
individuals: Mike Moody, John Atkins, Jack Hammond, Mike Clarke, Kay 
Patterson, Craig Roberts, Bill Taylor, David Moryc, Bob Rees, and, 
frankly, so


many others who have worked tirelessly on this project. It is because 
of their hard work that the cultural, historical, and recreational 
benefits of the Molalla River will be protected for generations to

  Mr. Speaker, as the former chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's 
Caucus and an avid outdoorsman, I rise today in support of S. 47, the 
Natural Resources Management Act.
  But let's be clear. Where does most of the funding come from to fund 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund? The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is overwhelmingly funded by royalties from offshore oil and gas 
leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is funded mostly from money 
energy companies that produce fossil fuels pay the Federal Government.
  Even though we are going to overwhelmingly, even with bipartisan 
support, permanently reauthorize a program that has enjoyed success 
since 1964, it will remain in jeopardy. Why? Because many of the 
Democrats supporting this have also supported this asinine, illogical, 
and scientifically unfounded proposal called the Green New Deal. A 
shift under the Green New Deal away from oil and gas to complete 
dependence on renewables, and you can kiss this fund good-bye.
  How will they propose to pay for the Land and Water Conversation 
Fund? I can assure you it won't be from royalties generated by 
renewable energy. It will be from higher taxes.
  I support energy exploration. I support conservation and this bill 
with as little cost to the American taxpayer. That is why I rise in 
support, but I implore everyone to think about how counterproductive 
the Green New Deal really is in actually conserving our precious 
environment.
  It is time we hold the Green New Deal's supporters accountable to the 
lack of logic and science behind their proposals that have been 
estimated to cost up to $93 trillion.",D000615,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I am excited to have the opportunity to speak on this 
bill, and I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this 
important lands package.
  Now, there is one section, the same as   Dan Newhouse's, that is 
particularly near and dear to my heart and critical for my district and 
for the State of Washington. It is the Yakima River Basin Integrated 
Plan that you just heard about.
  This forward-thinking legislation will ensure water security for our 
farmers, rivers, salmon, and communities for the foreseeable future. It 
allows Tribes to make important infrastructure improvements, protects 
local salmon habitat, and, therefore, is also instrumental in saving 
our dwindling Puget Sound orcas.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud my Republican colleague, Mr. Newhouse, and 
also our Senators, Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, and so many people 
who worked hard on this plan to make it come true, for the effort they 
have put in over so many years to see this legislation through.
  The Yakima River Basin Integrated Plan is a model for the rest of the 
country on how to address water scarcity in a changing climate. 
Partners with very divergent interests all came together with a common 
goal of protecting Washington's environment and wildlife and ensuring 
our communities are resilient in the face of a changing climate.

permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
  This vital piece of legislation will benefit millions of Americans in 
innumerable ways, from promoting recreational activity to contributing 
to our Nation's robust economy, along with furthering environmental 
protection and wildlife conservation.
  The Land and Water Conservation Fund benefits 98 percent of counties 
across the United States and contributes to an economy that encompasses 
1 out of 15 American jobs.
  Since its establishment over 50 years ago, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund has greatly benefited my home district in Bucks and 
Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania.
  Treasured public lands, such as Nockamixon State Park and Tyler State 
Park, and cherished community venues, such as Hatfield Community Park, 
are all just a few of the examples of the beneficiaries of this 
valuable fund.
  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support the

thank my good friends for working together to produce this magnificent 
lands package.
  Mr. Speaker, this lands package takes all our precious land 
seriously, including our urban parks. I particularly appreciate that 
this bill allows the District of Columbia to receive full State grant 
funding for our city parks.
  First off is Franklin Park in downtown D.C. to be rehabilitated with 
public-private partnership money using Federal, local, and private-
sector funding.
  This bill incentivizes the private sector to step up and do its part 
to see that our public parks are as good for business as they are for 
people. The Founders of the Capital city made sure that the Capital 
would be a city of parks. Watch us set an example for urban parks 
throughout the country by supporting this important legislation.",N000147,2019-02-26

me this time.
  Mr. Speaker, the Natural Resources Management Act is notable for its 
bipartisan support and for the conservation of our natural treasures.
  Tennessee's Second District, the district I represent, is home to a 
large portion of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Mr. Speaker, 
the most visited national park in our Nation. Last year, more than 10 
million visitors enjoyed the park, its wildlife, and its beautiful 
views and vistas.
  The Foothills Parkway traverses the park, and it includes a bridge 
currently called, creatively enough, Bridge 2. S. 47 would rename the 
bridge for the late Dean Stone, a longtime editor of The Daily Times in 
Maryville, Tennessee.
  During his tenure at The Daily Times, Dean advocated for the 
completion of the Foothills Parkway that enables so many to view the 
park. I hope to take my daughter, Isabel, and my wife, Kelly, up there 
shortly.
  Bridge 2 posed one of the greatest challenges to the parkway's 
completion. It has been described as an engineering marvel, Mr. 
Speaker, for the construction techniques that minimized its 
environmental impact.
  It is fitting that this bridge bears Dean's name, not only so we can 
continue our stewardship of these landscapes, but also so that we can 
honor the people who pushed us to preserve them and increase their 
accessibility.",B001309,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support S. 
47, the Natural Resources Management Act.
  This legislation includes important provisions for public lands 
across our Nation, but specifically for three national parks in the 
State of Georgia. One of those includes my own piece of legislation, a 
boundary expansion for the Fort Frederica National Monument in the 
First Congressional District of Georgia.
  Designed by General James Oglethorpe in 1733 on St. Simons Island, 
Fort Frederica was built to defend the young colony against attack from 
the Spanish in Florida. Nine years later, in 1742, General Oglethorpe's 
design was put to the test. The Spanish invaded the Georgia colony as 
part of the larger War of Jenkins' Ear headed directly for Fort 
Frederica.
  The Spaniards numbered around 5,000 troops, while General Oglethorpe 
had fewer than 1,000 regular soldiers, Native Americans, and local 
colonists garrisoned inside the tabby structure. The English detected 
the Spanish invasion, waded into the marsh, and ambushed the enemy 
troops in an engagement now called the Battle of Bloody Marsh. 
Consequently, this battle turned back the Spanish and was the last of 
their offensives into the colony of Georgia.
  This story, battle, and fort is an important moment in Georgia 
history, taught to elementary students throughout the State as a marker 
of our resolve and a turning point that helped to create the State of 
Georgia that we now know.
  In passing years, specifically with updates in technology, we 
increase our knowledge of history through new findings. That is exactly 
the opportunity we have here with Fort Frederica and why we need this 
legislation.
  Studies now show that land just outside the national park boundary 
was used as a campground and even a battery that protected the area 
from warships. This bill adjusts the existing Fort Frederica National 
Monument to include those locations inside the boundary, in an effort 
to better preserve those locations and continue to learn more about 
this area and the critical events that unfolded here in the First 
Congressional District of Georgia to create our home State of Georgia.
  This legislation has been in the works for the last 12 years, 
beginning when the Saint Simons Land Trust temporarily purchased the 
additional land in 2007.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee for their work on this. We need to 
preserve this history for generations to come.",C001103,2019-02-26

consume.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate those who have come down and 
spoken on this particular bill, especially when you can say the word 
``Oglethorpe'' all the time. It is one of the great names in American 
history.
  This is a good piece of legislation that will make some solutions and 
move this forward. It is not perfect, but it actually solves some 
problems. Many are parochial, but significant, local concerns.
  That is why this package is here. It passed the 63 bills that we have 
passed in the House but were sitting in the Senate. This has a chance 
of actually bringing some kind of cloture to all of that.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge favorable adoption of this piece of legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.",B001250,2019-02-26

  Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who voiced their support for S. 47.
  Before we close and turn to a vote, I again express my thanks to my 
colleagues who helped bring this bill before us today. It is a major 
win for conservation across the United States, and I strongly encourage 
all my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
  The American people need to know from this Congress that there are 
opportunities to produce bipartisan wins, whether it is for 
conservation or public lands or, more importantly, for the people of 
this country. I think this bill represents that.

  I extend my appreciation and my thanks to respective staffs on both 
sides of the aisle, for their hard work in bringing this together.
  As my friend from Utah said at the outset of this conversation today, 
it is not a perfect bill, but it is an effort on the part of many of us 
who came to this with disparate views, different opinions, and 
opposition to some of its content. It was an effort to try to do 
something that reflected common ground. I think this bill reflects 
common ground. I think it is a win for all of us.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of S. 
47, and I yield back the balance of my time.",G000551,2019-02-26

S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act.
  This public lands package represents a real investment in our natural 
heritage.
  By protecting over 1.3 million acres as wilderness, and making 
significant expansions of some of our most sacred national parks, this 
legislation will ensure that our public lands are pristine and 
accessible for our children and grandchildren.
  As a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman, I am especially proud that this 
package includes legislation from my ACCESS ACT that is crucial to 
sportsmen and sportswomen across the country.
  This includes my legislation to permanently reauthorize the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, our nation's most successful conservation 
program in all 50 states, for over 50 years.
  And, S. 47 includes my language to encourage innovative ways for 
citizens to work alongside natural resource agencies to conserve 
wildlife and its habitat.

negotiate this important public lands package and I urge my colleagues

498,HONORING KEVIN CORBETT,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE227-6,0,Mr. GRIFFITH,"  Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise In honor of Kevin Corbett of 
Bristol, Virginia, who passed away on February 15, 2019, at the age of 
63. Kevin was filled with devotion to the people of the City of 
Bristol.
  In Kevin's younger years, he served his country by enlisting in the 
United States Army. As an Armor Crewman, he eventually rose to


Staff Sergeant. He continued his service in Bristol by joining its 
Police Department in 1982. When he retired in 2006, he was a Detective 
Lieutenant in the Criminal Investigation Division.
  Outside of his career, he remained a beloved and active presence in 
the Bristol community. I knew him for his work on the Ninth District 
Republican Committee, where he was the Bristol Unit Chairman and 
represented the district on the State Central Committee. As a member of 
St. Anne Catholic Church, he was devoted to his God and his parish.
  Kevin will be long remembered by many for his kindnesses. Befitting a 
man who followed a career path of service, he was always willing to 
help others. His survivors include his two children, Allison and Shawn, 
five grandchildren, and his sister, Jackie Collins. I offer my 
condolences to them on the loss of this fine man.

499,"TERMINATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019",CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE230,0,Ms. KAPTUR,"  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to praise this House for its swift 
passage of H.J. Res 46, a bipartisan bill to terminate President 
Trump's declaration of a Fake National Emergency.
  The President's declaration is not only an unconstitutional attempt 
to circumvent Congress and the will of the people. It also shows an 
unprecedented disregard for precedent, as well as the values and 
institutions enshrined in our Constitution.
  To pay for his wall, President Trump will not get the funds from 
Mexico as he promised but from our troops, robbing $3.5 billion from 
the Department of Defense, funds which were passed to improve military 
family housing, training facilities, security of overseas bases, and 
much more.
  Just in Ohio, over $90 million in military construction investment is 
being placed at risk, including $61,000,000 for Wright-Patterson Air 
Force Base's Intelligence Production Complex and $7,400,000 for Camp 
Ravenna's Automated Multipurpose Machine Gun Range.
  Mr. Speaker, this declaration was not founded in the security of our 
nation, but in delivering on an ill-advised campaign promise. We cannot 
allow the President to ask those who have sacrificed already to 
sacrifice even more--especially for an expensive border wall few think 
will even work. Now, it's on the Senate to take up and pass this 
resolution without delay.

501,OBSERVING THE 27TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KHOJALY MASSACRE,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE232-4,0,Mr. CHABOT,"  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise in observance of the victims of the 
Khojaly Massacre, a barbarous atrocity committed against innocent 
Azerbaijani civilians. Tuesday, February 26, marked the 27th 
anniversary of this bloody episode.
  The story is all too tragic. Khojaly, in the region of Nagorno-
Karabakh, was surrounded by Armenian and Soviet troops in the fall of 
1991. After bombarding the city these troops attacked on the night of 
February 25 and 26, killing 600 innocent Azerbaijanis, including 
elderly people, women, and children. Hundreds more were left severely 
disabled from the attacks. Over fifty people were killed with wanton 
brutality, many children lost parents, and eight whole families were 
wiped out.
  Human Rights Watch described these attacks as a ``massacre'' and in a 
1992 report stated that the attacks by Armenian and Soviet forces, 
``deliberately disregarded [the] customary law restraint on attacks.'' 
This massacre remains the darkest chapter in the Azerbaijan-Armenian 
conflict.
  Unfortunately, the dispute over Nagorno Karabakh is still ongoing, 
despite the United States and the international community not 
recognizing the independent rule of the region and supporting a 
negotiated settlement. I call on all parties involved to find a 
peaceful resolution to this decades old conflict.
  I encourage my colleagues to join with me and the Azerbaijani people 
as they remember this tragedy.

518,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1568,4,Mr. ALEXANDER,"  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will be voting on 
the President's nomination of John Ryder, of Memphis, to be a member of 
the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
  To those of us in the seven State region that the TVA serves, it is a 
very important institution. Its job is to provide large amounts of 
reliable, low-cost electricity, which is the basis for how we live and 
how we work. It has a lot to do with our ability to attract jobs. Its 
job is to provide that energy in a clean way so we can see our 
mountains and so we meet the emissions standards in our metropolitan 
areas that allow us to attract and grow more jobs.
  The TVA is fulfilling its mission very well. It is heading toward a 
position in which it will be about 40-percent nuclear in its production 
of electricity, about 20 percent in natural gas, and about 20 percent 
in coal or a little less than that. It will have pollution control 
equipment on all of its coal plants. Most of the rest is hydroelectric 
power, and a little bit is renewable. In short, it has one of the 
cleanest portfolios in the country, and it is continuing to do that and 
is producing a lot of low-cost, reliable electricity.
  We are very fortunate to be in a region in which, as we look down the 
road 5, 10, or 15 years, we will be able to say to people who are 
thinking of moving themselves to Tennessee or moving their businesses 
to Tennessee or growing them there that they will be able to get a lot 
of reliable, low-cost electricity--all that they need. In addition to 
that, they will be able to see the Smoky Mountains because the air is a 
lot cleaner now that they have such a clean portfolio.
  So John Ryder's appointment is a very important appointment, and he 
is a well-qualified man for that position. He is one of Tennessee's 
best known lawyers and has been for a long time. Since the late 1980s, 
he has been listed as one of Tennessee's best lawyers. He is well 
respected by everyone who knows him.
  Senator Corker and I recommended him to President Trump, and we know 
him well. Senator Blackburn, who is Senator Corker's successor, has a 
high regard for John Ryder. All of us appreciate his willingness to 
serve, and we look forward to the voice vote we are going to have in a 
few minutes that will place him on TVA's Board. The Board has just 
selected a new chief executive officer. TVA is the largest public 
utility in the United States, perhaps in the world. It is an important 
assignment, and it is one I am delighted to recommend him for.
  There is one other thing, but I will not dwell on this because I 
spoke on this Monday night. Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder has been on the 
Senate's calendar for 9 months. He was nominated by President Trump a 
year ago. The problem has not been with Mr. Ryder because, as I said, 
President Trump nominated him after he was thoroughly vetted by the 
FBI. The Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee considered 
him, had a hearing, and reported him unanimously to the floor. Yet, for 
9 months, he waited there.
  One reason is, the Democrats have consistently obstructed the ability 
of Senator McConnell and the Republican majority to help President 
Trump form his government. The Democrats have required 128 times that 
Senator McConnell, the majority leader, file cloture motions to cut off 
debate to advance a nomination like Mr. Ryder's.
  Now, this is not a Cabinet position. This is not a lifetime judge. 
This is the part-time Board of an important institution. He is one of 
1,200 Presidential nominees that any President has who is subject to 
confirmation by advice and consent. It is the kind of nomination by 
which, if a committee unanimously reports it to the Senate, we will 
normally approve it by voice vote. Yet, on this vote, Senator McConnell 
was forced to file cloture a week ago. Then we had to wait an 
intervening day. Only then could we come to this vote.
  This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work, and this 
obstruction has to stop. Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford have 
introduced a resolution, which has been reported to the Senate by the 
rules committee, that would cause us to adopt a rule very much like the 
one we adopted in 2013, when I worked with a large number of Democrats 
and Republicans for the sole purpose of making it easier for President 
Obama--and his successors--to promptly confirm the men and women whom 
he chose to form a government.
  It received 78 votes. What we did at that time was simply say: You 
still keep the cloture motion, and you still wait an intervening day if 
you need it, but we reduce the postcloture time--not for Supreme Court 
Justices, not for circuit judges--simply for sub-Cabinet members and 
for district judges. We would reduce sub-Cabinet members to 8 hours and 
district judges to 2 hours.
  On Monday night, I invited my Democratic friends to work with me in 
2019 the way I worked with them in 2013. In a bipartisan way, let's 
make sure the Senate can do what it has historically done--to have 
promptly considered and voted up or down, with 51 votes, the nominees 
of any President of the United States for the 1,200 positions that form 
the government.
  There have been some conversations. I hope Senator Blunt and Senator 
Lankford will continue to have those conversations with the Democratic 
Members, but there are nine Democratic Senators, by my count, who are 
seeking to be the next President of the United States. I hope they can 
look 20 months down the road and realize that


just one Republican Senator could do to them, if one of them were to 
become President, what the Democrats have done to President Trump. It 
would be very difficult for the next Democratic President, if there 
were to be one, to form a government. We don't want that to happen. 
That diminishes the advice and consent role of the Senate. It fills up 
the government with appointees who are acting and whom we don't know, 
and they are not really accountable to us. That is not the way this 
place is supposed to work.
  So I renew my invitation to my Democratic friends to work with me the 
way a number of us worked with them in 2011, in 2012, and in 2013. 
Let's change the rules in the right way. Let's basically adopt 
virtually the same rule we adopted in 2013 and allow this President and 
any President to get prompt consideration and up-or-down votes of their 
nominees.
  I congratulate Mr. Ryder on his confirmation. I am grateful for his 
willingness to serve, and I am sorry he had to wait so long for the 
opportunity. The people of Tennessee and the seven State region will be 
much better off for his service within this important institution.

kid-glove treatment for the next Democratic President.

disarmament by agreeing to the Blunt-Lankford proposal based on the

",,2019-02-28
537,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,6,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would like to begin with a few 
words on President Trump's Hanoi summit with North Korea. The President 
should be commended for his personal commitment to persuading Kim Jong 
Un to pursue a different path.
  By January 2017, it was clear the prior administration's policy of 
strategic patience had not worked. In retrospect, it was not very 
strategic to sit patiently while North Korea dramatically expanded its 
nuclear and missile capabilities. The Trump administration, in taking a 
different path, moved quickly to adopt the policy of maximum pressure, 
rallying international partners to respond firmly to North Korea's 
provocations. The President also demonstrated a willingness to engage 
the North Korean leader directly, breathing new life into our diplomacy 
to solve this seemingly intractable problem.
  The President has gone the extra mile to demonstrate his sincerity in 
wanting to resolve this issue. It was smart to bring Kim Jong Un to 
Singapore and to Vietnam to expose the North Korean delegation to the 
kind of economic prosperity that could be possible if he were to choose 
a new path.
  High-level diplomacy can carry high-level risk, but the President 
should be commended for walking away when it became clear insufficient 
progress had been made on denuclearization. Kim Jong Un now has a long 
train ride home, and he will have time to reflect on the future that is 
still within North Korea's grasp, but the President has demonstrated 
that such a future must be accompanied by real denuclearization.
  Every country has a stake in North Korea's denuclearization. I hope 
China and other countries with influence over Kim Jong Un will do their 
part to urge him to return to the negotiating table and seize the 
opportunity to bring prosperity to the people of North Korea and peace 
and stability to the Korean Peninsula and to the region.


                              Nominations

  Madam President, on another matter, this week, the Senate has made 
progress in confirming President Trump's nominees. On Tuesday, Eric 
Miller became the 31st circuit court judge to be confirmed under this 
administration. Yesterday, we confirmed Michael Desmond to serve as 
Chief Counsel at the IRS.
  Of course, this progress is only remarkable given the Senate 
Democrats'


historic level of obstruction. As I noted yesterday, for example, Mr. 
Desmond's nomination earned near-unanimous approval from the Finance 
Committee in August of last year but only this week received a vote on 
the Senate floor. So many important roles are still vacant with well-
qualified nominees who are ready and willing to fill them.
  Later today, we will vote on Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator 
of the EPA. Mr. Wheeler has spent the last year as Deputy and now as 
Acting Administrator. He has wasted no time in proving he has what it 
takes to lead the Agency. In drawing on a wealth of experience that 
includes service as staff director of the Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee and a tenure at the EPA that first began back in 1991, 
Mr. Wheeler has proven his ability to advance pragmatic solutions to 
pressing environmental challenges. I hope each of my colleagues will 
join me in supporting yet another well-qualified nominee and vote to 
confirm him.
  Later today, we will also have an opportunity to take care of one 
other long-overdue item--the nomination of John Ryder to the Board of 
the Tennessee Valley Authority. Even after being reported out of 
committee twice on a voice vote, this well-qualified, uncontroversial 
nominee was nearly subjected to a needless cloture vote this week. I am 
glad that, instead, we will be voting to confirm Ryder and sending him 
on to work on behalf of the Tennessee Valley communities.


                           The Green New Deal

  Madam President, on another matter, I have been spotlighting all week 
our Democratic colleagues' hard left turn toward socialism--their 
fixation on gaining more government control over more of our lives. 
With the Democratic Politician Protection Act, Washington Democrats 
want to control more of what Americans can say about them and how they 
get elected.
  With the so-called Green New Deal, Washington Democrats want our 
government to spend more money than the entire gross domestic product 
of the entire world on new spending programs to forcibly remodel 
Americans' homes, take away our cars, dramatically increase energy 
costs, and disarm our economy while China roars straight ahead. You 
might think that right there is plenty of leftwing social engineering. 
You might think it is enough--oh, but they aren't stopping there, the 
Democrats. They are going after Americans' healthcare and their private 
health insurance plans.
  Earlier this week, House Democrats introduced a bill that would take 
away every private insurance option that American families rely on and 
force everyone into a single, government-run system. Employer-sponsored 
coverage wouldn't just be discouraged, it would be illegal. They call 
this legislation Medicare for All. It is really more like ``Medicare 
for None.'' It completely explodes the Medicare system as it currently 
exists. The program our seniors have paid into for decades and now rely 
on, the Democrats want gone--wiped out.
  Remember, by the time Americans turn 65, most have paid tens and tens 
of thousands of dollars into the current system through Medicare taxes. 
According to one estimate, Americans with average earnings who reached 
the retirement age back in 2015 will have paid a present value of more 
than $70,000 into Medicare over the years.
  American seniors have counted on Medicare. They have planned around 
it, and they have paid into it with every paycheck. Yet now House 
Democrats have decided it is time to change the rules on them in the 
middle of the game. They want to tear down Medicare until the only 
thing left is the name and slap that name on a completely different 
system that a few House Democrats invented and that the Democratic 
Socialists of America is proud to endorse. The Democratic Socialists of 
America is proud to endorse that. Then the Democrats propose to take 
that new government system and pile every single American into it as a 
one-size-fits-all--long waits for treatment, higher costs, and an end 
to Medicare as we know it--no choice, no options, and no alternatives 
allowed.
  More than 170 million Americans currently get health insurance 
through their employers. Surveys show that a majority is actually 
pretty happy with its own specific plans. Well, too bad. The Democrats 
want those families thrown off those plans. Within 2 years, their 
proposal would make private health insurance, as Americans know it, 
illegal across the board. It would be unlawful for employers to offer 
health benefits to their employees and their families. It is right 
there in the bill. It would be against the law for employers to offer 
healthcare to their employees.
  Here is what it reads: ``It shall be unlawful for a private health 
insurer to sell health insurance coverage . . . [or] an employer to 
provide benefits . . . that duplicate the benefits provided under this 
Act by the government.''
  How about that? We all remember ObamaCare's famous broken promise: If 
you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it. If you like the doctor 
you have, you can keep your doctor too. That was the pledge before the 
Democrats' policy was actually implemented. Not long after, the fact 
checkers named that promise their ``lie of the year.''
  Well, this time around, my Democratic friends are not even bothering 
to pretend that families' lives would not be disrupted. A reporter 
asked one of our Senate colleagues who is running for President, ``So 
for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep 
it?'' Her response? Listen to this. ``Let's eliminate all of that.'' 
This is one of our colleagues running for President.
  All the plans American families like and rely on made illegal--
illegal--by this bill, not just unaffordable, not just inconvenient, 
illegal, and all to clear space for a new government takeover.
  So how much is this massive takeover going to cost? Well, under even 
conservative estimates, this proposal would cost more than $32 trillion 
over the first 10 years--$32 trillion over the first 10 years, more 
than the Federal Government spent on everything over the last 8 years 
combined.
  Where is that money going to come from? Well, I think we all know the 
answer to that: massive tax hikes on the American people, cuts to 
services, rationing of healthcare, broken promises, and debt. That is 
where it is going to come from.
  Here is what one economist found in the numbers.

       The Federal Reserve's data only go back to 1929, but it's 
     unlikely that the government ever collected more than 20 
     percent of GDP in taxes. To fully fund Medicare-for-all, that 
     figure would have to rise to more than 30 percent of GDP.

  Now, look, I am sure we will hear the class warfare rhetoric about 
soaking the rich and making a small group of Americans pay for all of 
this, but it will not be true. We all know it will not be true. The 
bill for this $32 trillion takeover would land squarely--squarely--on 
middle-class families. There is no way around it.
  Even if the IRS confiscated every dollar of Americans' adjusted gross 
incomes over $1 million--took it all--if the IRS took every cent over 
$1 million, it wouldn't even pay for half of the proposal--wouldn't 
even pay for half of it.
  Now, look, class warfare may be a favorite tactic across the aisle, 
but numbers are stubborn things. Math is math. The costs would have to 
fall on the middle class. Actually, they would fall on everyone, one 
way or another.
  That economist put it this way, he said: ``The simple fact is that 
financing Medicare-for-all would require a dramatic shift in the 
Federal tax structure and a substantial tax increase for almost all 
Americans.'' Almost all Americans.
  So let's sum it up. Washington Democrats want the American people to 
fork over a recordbreaking percentage of our gross domestic product in 
taxes for the privilege of having their healthcare plans ripped away 
from them, even if they are happy with what they have, and the middle 
class is going to pay for it. What a great deal.
  All this, and I haven't even begun to explain how this takeover would 
cut Americans' access to care and degrade the quality of care. We have 
all heard horror stories from abroad about bureaucrats making decisions 
instead of citizens and long waits for treatment.
  Last year in Canada, the median wait time for medically necessarily 
treatment from a specialist was 21 weeks--21 weeks. That is the average 
wait time for medically necessary treatment in Canada--more than double 
what it was up there just 25 years ago.


  In the UK, it is not just long waits patients have to contend with, 
it is flatout denials of care. In the first quarter of last year alone, 
Britain's National Health Service abruptly canceled 25,000 surgeries--
canceled them.
  Imagine that--being fully reliant on the government for healthcare, 
planning on a medically necessary procedure, and being told at the last 
minute the whole thing was called off. Welcome to socialized medicine. 
Needless to say, if some Democrats had their way, you wouldn't have to 
imagine much longer.
  Before I conclude, I want to highlight one more thing. I suppose no 
far-left wish list like this would have been complete without radical 
policies on the issue of abortion, without trying to hurt pro-life 
Americans.
  Sure enough, this legislation would shatter the longstanding 
consensus--consensus--that Federal dollars should not pay for abortions 
and force taxpayers to fund abortions nationwide. That has been the 
longstanding consensus. Talk about a perfect case study in the perils 
of a Federal takeover. Talk about a perfect example of why Washington 
Democrats should not get the power to twist American healthcare to suit 
their own radical views--$32 trillion, every family kicked off its 
insurance plans, no choice, no options for the middle class, just a 
huge bill.
  The Democrats are so confident the American people will love their 
new government plan that they feel the need to make other kinds of 
insurance illegal, and Democratic Presidential candidates are rushing 
headlong to embrace all of this--watching them embrace all of this. 
Goodness. If this is one of their best and brightest new ideas, I would 
sure hate to see the bad ones.

542,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,11,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, several hours ago, in the middle of the 
night here in the United States, we received word that the summit in 
Hanoi between the United States and North Korea would be ending 
prematurely. Unable to reach an understanding on either sanctions 
relief or denuclearization, President Trump decided to walk away from 
the talks without an agreement.
  Though I don't know the details yet, and I look forward to speaking 
with Secretary Pompeo, I was pleased to see the President recognized 
North Korea's unwillingness to strike a comprehensive deal. President 
Trump did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal 
for the sake of a photo op.
  Just like the President, I want a deal with North Korea that will 
bring an end to the conflict and change the course of the region. 
However, I have always been concerned about the possibility of a bad 
deal, especially with the other pressures currently on the President. A 
deal that fell short of complete, verifiable denuclearization would 
have only made North Korea stronger and the world less safe, and it 
would have squandered the substantial leverage our negotiators have now 
thanks to the bite of sanctions.
  President Trump must now apply the lesson of North Korea diplomacy to 
our trade negotiations with China. President Trump must have the 
courage to do the same thing with China as he has done for North Korea. 
The President must be willing to hold the line and walk away if China 
does not agree to meaningful, enduring, structural reform of its unfair 
trading policy. President Trump should not fall into the trap of 
seeking a deal for the sake of a deal, especially now that talks with 
Pyongyang are on hold.
  What he did in North Korea was right. He must do the same thing in 
China--hold out because he has the upper hand--until we get China to do 
the right thing. Just because an accord is, for the moment, out of 
reach in North Korea does not mean that the President should be any 
more eager to strike one with China if the terms are inadequate or 
unacceptable.
  The President deserves credit for bringing China to the negotiating 
table with tariffs, but he must not squander that opportunity by 
cutting a deal that fails to achieve American priorities. Unless China 
promises to end its predatory cyber theft of American intellectual 
property and know-how, unless China promises to stop artificially 
propping up its businesses, unless China promises to end its practice 
of forcing American companies to give away their IP to their future 
Chinese competitors in order to do business in China, President Trump 
should walk away from the negotiations once again.
  As important as North Korea is to national security, China is just as 
critical--maybe even more critical--to American economic security. 
President Trump and his team have a generational imperative to get this 
one right. They have a generational imperative not to squander the 
chance to achieve permanent reforms to China's economic relations with 
the world, changes that would finally put American investors, 
businesses, and workers on a level playing field.


                   Bipartisan Background Checks Bill

  Madam President, on guns, I was so glad to see the House passage of a 
background checks bill. I urge Leader McConnell to take it up in the 
Senate.
  Background checks are supported overwhelmingly by close to 90 percent 
of the American people--a majority of Republicans, a majority of gun 
owners. It doesn't take anyone's guns away. It simply says that if you 
are a felon, spousal abuser, or adjudicated mentally ill, you shouldn't 
have a gun, and it takes the means to make sure that happens.
  Now there are so many loopholes in the background check law--the 
Brady law, which I was proud to lead the charge on back in the House in 
1994. Now, some 25 years later, they have found ways around it through 
the internet and through gun shows. Just as it was the right thing to 
do to close the loopholes that existed in 1994 with the Brady law, it 
is the right thing to do to close those loopholes that have come about 
since the law passed. It simply updates the Brady law, which has saved 
tens of thousands of lives.


                             Climate Change

  Madam President, finally, on climate, in a short time, I will be 
returning to the floor to lead a group of Democratic Senators in 
talking about climate change. One of the great but positive ironies of 
Leader McConnell's stunt to put the Green New Deal on the floor is that 
it has inspired Members of both parties to talk about climate change--
more than ever before, maybe--under the Republican leadership in the 
Senate.
  Democrats are more than happy about that. We want to turn the 
spotlight back to the issue of climate change and keep it there, where 
it belongs. Climate change is an existential threat to our planet, not 
just in the future but right now. We should be talking about climate 
change nearly every day, and more than that, the Senate should be 
taking bold action to address it.
  So I am glad at least Leader McConnell is talking about climate. He 
just says what he is not for.
  So I will repeat the three questions I have asked Leader McConnell 
repeatedly: One, Leader McConnell, do you believe that climate change 
is real? Two, do you believe, Leader McConnell, that it is caused by 
humans? Three, do you believe Congress should take immediate action to 
address the crisis of climate change?
  Until Leader McConnell puts something positive on the floor and 
starts talking positively, no one is going to pay much attention to his 
stunts and his gambits, but, certainly, we Democrats are energized to 
talk positively about the things we want to do to deal with this issue, 
and we will be positive and discuss positive proposals until we get 
something done in this Chamber.

544,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,13,Mr. THUNE,"  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, just in getting started this morning, I 
wanted to take a minute to mention the good news on economic growth we 
received this morning.
  While headlines mentioned the very solid 2.9 percent growth number 
for


2018, if we use the measure that economists prefer, the news is even 
better--3.1 percent growth from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the 
fourth quarter of 2018. This is just more evidence that Republican 
economic policies are working.
  We lifted burdensome regulations and passed a comprehensive reform of 
our Tax Code to put more money in Americans' pockets and make it easier 
for businesses to grow and expand jobs. Now we are seeing the effects.
  Unemployment is low. January marked the 11th straight month that 
unemployment has been at or below 4 percent. That is the longest streak 
in nearly five decades. The number of job openings hit a record high in 
December, and, once again, there were more job openings than job 
seekers. Wage growth has accelerated. Wages have now been growing at a 
rate of 3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage 
growth reached this level was in 2009. Median household income is at an 
all-time, inflation-adjusted record of $61,372. The list goes on.
  What does all of this mean? It means more money in American families' 
bank accounts, more jobs and opportunities for American workers, more 
Americans feeling hopeful about their future.
  Republican economic policies are making life better for American 
families, which is why it is particularly disturbing that Democrats are 
currently advancing policies that would not only destroy the economic 
progress we have made but would severely damage our economy for the 
long term.


                           The Green New Deal

  Madam President, yesterday, I came down and talked about the so-
called Green New Deal, which is a fantasy put forward by a number of 
our colleagues on the other side. I think 11 Democratic Senators have 
cosponsored that legislation, which the early analysis shows would cost 
somewhere between $51 trillion and $94 trillion over the next decade. 
To put that into more personal terms, that is $600,000 per family in 
this country--the cost of the Green New Deal.
  My colleague from Illinois, the Democratic whip, was asked about it 
on an interview recently, and he responded by saying that he had read 
and reread the proposal and still doesn't know what the heck it is. 
Well, that is an honest answer. But I think what we do know is that 
this is a proposal that will dramatically, massively drive up costs for 
American families. It would be a disaster for the pocketbooks of the 
people of this country, which brings me to my topic for today.
  On Tuesday, POLITICO released an article with this headline: ``House 
Democrats to release `Medicare for All' bill--without a price tag.'' 
That was the headline.
  This is becoming par for the course for Democrats. First we get the 
Green New Deal resolution without a pricetag. Now we get Medicare for 
All, also without a pricetag. Why? Well, because there is no way to 
actually pay for these socialist fantasies. They sound nice, until you 
actually look at the staggering costs.
  Imagine if you decided that you needed to repair the plumbing at your 
house, and the plumber came and suggested that not only should you 
repair the plumbing, you should rebuild the house from the ground up. 
Then he wanted you to sign on for demolition and reconstruction without 
telling you how much it would cost.
  That is what Democrats are trying to do on a grand scale here. They 
want to overhaul large parts of the economy and rebuild them on 
socialist lines, all without telling you what it will cost or how they 
will pay for it.
  Of course, while it is irresponsible, it is not surprising that 
Democrats don't want to discuss the pricetag for their fantasies, 
because there is no way to pay for these massive government takeovers 
without taxing ordinary Americans.
  Democrats make vague suggestions that these programs can be paid for 
by taxing the rich. That is always the line. But the truth is that 
taxing millionaires at a 100-percent income tax rate would not pay for 
these programs. Taxing Americans making much less than $1 million at a 
100-percent rate wouldn't pay for these programs.
  The cost of these programs will never be borne just by millionaires. 
These programs will be paid for on the backs of working families in 
this country. That is the pure and simple reality.
  A left-leaning think tank modeled a version of the Medicare for All 
plan proposed by the junior Senator from Vermont and found that it 
would cost a staggering $32 trillion over 10 years--$32 trillion--and 
it is possible that the House Democrats' plan could cost even more.
  POLITICO noted in their story that, unlike the plan of the Senator 
from Vermont, the House Democrats' plan would also ``fund long-term 
care, a particularly expensive part of the health system.''
  But moving away from the staggering pricetag, let's talk about what 
life would be like under Medicare for All.
  For starters, of course, it would mean that Americans would lose 
their private insurance, even if they like their private insurance. 
Democrats have been very clear about this.
  At a CNN townhall just this week, the junior Senator from Vermont was 
asked, ``Will these people be able to keep their health insurance 
plans, their private plans through their employers, if there is a 
Medicare for All program that you endorse?''
  The Senator from Vermont's response: ``No.''
  Another Democratic candidate for President, the junior Senator from 
New York, was recently asked:

       Should ending private insurance, as we know it, be a 
     Democratic . . . goal, and do you think it's an urgent goal?

  Her response:

       Oh yeah, it is a goal. An urgent goal.

  So if you like your health insurance, you definitely will not be able 
to keep it. You will be forced into the government healthcare plan, 
whether you like that plan or not. Then, of course, you will be facing 
long wait times and likely a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, 
and you will have fewer options if the government decides a particular 
treatment isn't cost-effective and shouldn't be covered.
  Democrats can talk all they want about generous coverage, but what 
happens when they don't have the money for that generous coverage? We 
already know this program is likely to cost more than $30 trillion over 
just 10 years, and government programs aren't exactly known for staying 
under budget.
  What happens if it ends up costing more or if the government can't 
even pay the $32 trillion that we know it is going to cost? Well, there 
will be still more taxes, undoubtedly, but also reductions in coverage 
and care.
  Our Nation's current Medicare Program is going bankrupt. If action 
isn't taken, in 2026 Medicare will not be able to pay the benefits that 
are promised under current law. Yet Democrats are suggesting that we 
more than quintuple the size of the program and that somehow we will be 
able to pay for that.
  If we ever do pay for Medicare for All, we will pay for it by taking 
the money from the American people through devastating tax increases 
that will permanently reduce Americans' standard of living and 
permanently damage our economy.
  Like all socialist dreams, Medicare for All would quickly become a 
nightmare for the American people.

",,2019-02-28
552,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,21,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now I want to address two more issues 
related to this topic.
  First, are the reports that the President is planning to create a 
panel of cherry-picked scientists who question the severity of climate 
change to ``counter'' the scientific consensus. I mentioned these 
reports earlier this week, but I want to update my friends in this 
Chamber that Democrats are in the process of preparing legislation that 
would defund this fake climate panel. We hope this legislation, like 
our resolution, will eventually be bipartisan because it shouldn't be 
partisan to oppose a group of handpicked climate deniers spreading the 
fossil fuel industry's propaganda under the imprimatur of the White 
House. It shouldn't be partisan to oppose the administration's setting 
up its own Orwellian Ministry of Truth on climate change.
  So I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle who believe in 
climate science to sign on to our legislation once we have it ready.


                      Nomination of Andrew Wheeler

  Mr. President, second is the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be the 
next Administrator of the EPA--a question currently before the Senate. 
I opposed Mr. Wheeler's nomination to be the Deputy Administrator, and 
I will oppose his nomination to be Administrator as well.
  I opposed Mr. Wheeler initially because I thought his career as a 
lobbyist working on behalf of big polluters and climate deniers was 
exactly the wrong kind of experience for a job at the EPA, the 
Environmental Protection Agency. He spent most of his career lobbying 
against the same environmental protections he now oversees, and his 
time at the EPA has done little to assuage my original concerns.
  Mr. Wheeler has failed to take meaningful action on toxic chemicals, 
including the chemical PFAS, which has plagued my home State. He has 
downplayed the severity of climate change and undermined several EPA 
programs that seek to address it, including the regulation of poisonous 
mercury from powerplants, efforts to reduce carbon emissions from cars 
and trucks, as well as replacing the Clean Power Plan.
  At a time when climate change is the No. 1 threat facing our planet, 
installing a man such as Mr. Wheeler as permanent Administrator of the 
EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--is the wrong thing to do.
  So as I said earlier this morning, Leader McConnell's move to bring 
the Green New Deal forward is nothing more than a stunt, but one of the 
great and positive ironies is that, finally, folks are talking about 
climate change again, more than at any time I can think of under this 
Republican majority.
  If and when Leader McConnell brings his version of the Green New Deal 
forward for a vote, we will demand that Republicans first answer the 
core questions on climate change.
  Again, three simple things: Do you believe climate change is real and 
happening? Do you believe human activity contributes to it? Do you 
believe Congress must act to address this pressing challenge?
  If Leader McConnell and my Republican friends can't answer those 
three questions--run away from them--the American people will see right 
through the ploy. The American people will see that Leader McConnell 
and his party stand against science and against facts, ostriches with 
their heads buried in the sand as the tide swiftly comes in.

554,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,23,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, our Democratic leader has set three 
plain and very obvious questions about fossil fuel-burning carbon 
emissions and climate change that should be easily answered by every 
single Member of the Senate, and the fact that this is a problem is a 
clear indication of fossil fuel influence in this body--the regrettable 
extent of fossil fuel influence in this body.
  It was not always this way. Here is a letter that a number of us came 
to the floor to talk about yesterday. The letter was written December 
23, 1986. There had been hearings on climate change in the Environment 
and Public Works Committee, and a bipartisan group of Senators wanted 
some answers. They wrote this letter to what then existed, an Office of 
Technology Assessment for the Congress, inquiring about how serious 
they felt this was and what could be done about it, signed by Senator 
Stafford, Senator Chafee, Senator Durenberger, and three Democrats in 
1986. I do not believe that a Republican Senator could be found to sign 
this letter today.
  I got here in 2007, and for that year, and in 2008 and 2009, we had 
multiple bipartisan climate bills being discussed in this body. Over 
and over again, there were a Democrat and Republican who got together 
and worked to try to solve the climate problem--more than a decade ago. 
We have seen bipartisanship on this issue.
  We have even seen, in 2009, this New York Times full-page 
advertisement signed by Donald J. Trump, which said that the science of 
climate change is ``scientifically irrefutable.'' Those were his words, 
not mine, in 2009, which said that if we don't act there would be 
``catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our 
planet''--his words, not mine. That was 1986, that was 2007, and this 
was 2009.
  Then something happened. Citizens United got decided by the Supreme 
Court or, to be fair to the Supreme Court, Citizens United got decided 
by five Republican appointees on the Supreme Court.
  In my view, the fossil fuel industry asked for that decision, 
predicted that decision, and they were off like a sprinter at the gun 
when they got that decision. From that moment, all of that bipartisan 
activity on climate change here in the Senate ended, and it ended 
because the fossil fuel industry was allowed to spend unlimited money 
in politics. They found out how to spend unlimited dark money in 
politics. It is politically obvious that if one can spend unlimited 
money in politics, one can also threaten to spend unlimited money in 
politics. So between the unlimited spending and the unlimited, 
anonymous dark money spending and whatever they did in the way of 
threats and promises, it has been like a heart attack--flatlined--here 
in the Senate, since that moment. It is a tragedy.
  In fact, if you go back to this letter for a minute, there were six 
signatories. We couldn't get six States to come to the floor yesterday 
because one of these States has two Republican Senators, and we 
couldn't get either of them to come to the floor.
  I don't know what has happened to the Republican Party that they 
can't take this seriously even now--even as States like Florida are 
flooding on sunny days, even as States see wildfires they have never 
seen before, even as farmers are recording drought and flood conditions 
that are unprecedented, even as my State looks forward to 5 or 6 feet 
of sea level rise.
  And then we got a clue as to what goes on here. This is a letter that 
was written on behalf of Andrew Wheeler, who is the slightly cleaned-up 
version of Scott Pruitt and who is pending before us to lead the 
Environmental Protection Agency. It ought to tell us a lot that the 
Republicans put up a coal lobbyist to represent the people of America 
leading the Environmental Protection Agency.
  What tells you a lot also is this letter of support for this guy. Who 
is on it? These are these phony-baloney front group organizations 
funded by the fossil fuel industry that got together to write this 
letter:
  The Heartland Institute. Koch-affiliated groups gave it $7.18 
million, and $730,000 came from Exxon. Heartland is such a slippery, 
slimy group that they compared climate scientists to the Unabomber. 
That is the company that they travel in.
  The Cornwall Alliance. Secret funding--we don't know, but they are 
always in this climate-denier fringe crowd. The founder doesn't believe 
in evolution. He said that tornadoes are a punishment from God, and 
that AIDS is punishment for being gay. You are running in great company 
with them, guys.
  FreedomWorks is next. They received $2.5 million from Koch-affiliated 
groups, and at least $130,000 from the American Petroleum Institute.
  The Competitive Enterprise Institute is next, with at least $2 
million given from Exxon, and Koch-affiliated groups gave at least $5.2 
million.


  Americans for Prosperity. This is basically the hit squad for the 
Kochs in politics. It is one of the largest dark-money election 
spenders, spending more than $70 million since Citizens United on 
Federal elections. They received a minimum of $12 million, that we know 
of, in funding from the Kochs and more than $23 million from the Koch-
linked Donors Trust. Donors Trust, by the way, is a big enterprise 
whose sole purpose is to launder away the identity of big donors so 
that their money can flow without people knowing who is behind it.
  Americans for Limited Government received at least $5.6 million from 
Koch-affiliated groups.
  Freedom Partners is described as ``the Koch brothers' secret bank.'' 
It has spent more than $55 million in dark money on Federal elections 
since Citizens United and received at least $3 million from the Kochs, 
but, as usual, its funders are shrouded in secrecy.
  Americans for Tax Reform. The American Petroleum Institute gave at 
least $525,000, and Koch-affiliated groups gave at least $330,000.
  The Energy and Environmental Legal Institute received at least half a 
million dollars from Koch-affiliated groups.
  CFACT received at least $580,000 in funding from Exxon and more than 
$8 million from Koch-linked groups.
  Then, at the bottom is this little Caesar Rodney Institute, which is 
part of the larger State Policy Network, funded by the Kochs to spread 
their propaganda and poison into State legislatures.
  This crew of fossil-fuel-funded, climate-denying front groups have 
received a minimum of more than $63 million from the fossil fuel 
industry, and this is why we have Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, 
lined up to run our environmental agency in this country.

556,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,25,Mr. HEINRICH,"  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I rise today to state the obvious--to 
state in clear terms what scientists have been warning us about for 
decades. The scientific data couldn't be any clearer. Climate change is 
real. Climate change is here, and we are causing its devastating 
impacts and disruptions. Unless we start to implement policies to curb 
our carbon emissions and to mitigate its impacts, climate change will 
continue to wreak havoc upon communities across the Nation and around 
the world.
  These are facts. These facts present us with the greatest and most 
existential global challenge humanity has literally ever faced. There 
are not two sides to these facts. The Earth's five warmest years on 
record happened since 2014. It is not a coincidence. It is not an 
unexplained phenomenon. It is the direct result of both our actions and 
our inactions. Only the willfully ignorant refuse to acknowledge these 
facts and the gravity and urgency of what we face because of the fact 
of human-caused climate change.
  Unfortunately, the current occupant of the White House and too many 
here in Washington can be counted in that camp. President Trump's 
decision to upend the Clean Power Plan and pull us out of the Paris 
climate accord was perhaps the most consequential representation of his 
inward-looking, isolationist view for America. It was a dangerous 
abdication of our Nation's leadership role on the international stage, 
and if we choose to accept his failure to lead here in Congress, we 
will continue down a path toward a very real and very costly climate 
disruption.
  In the coming weeks, Majority Leader McConnell says he plans to call 
a vote here on the Senate on the Green New Deal resolution. I wish this 
were a genuine effort to address our climate challenges. Clearly, it is 
not. It is a political stunt by the majority leader to divide those who 
actually want to rise to the occasion and who actually want to address 
this crisis, rather than offer up any substantive solutions of his own.
  The majority leader would have you believe that solutions to climate 
change are too costly or they are just too impractical to be taken 
seriously. I don't know about you, but to me, it is that view that is 
wildly out of touch and, frankly, dangerous.
  President Trump and Republicans love to talk about the cost of 
climate action. What we should be focusing on is the much steeper cost 
of inaction and the economic benefits of America's leading the clean 
energy transition.
  As an engineer, I am certain that our capacity to confront the 
challenges that we face, large and small, rests heavily on our ability 
to make policy that is actually driven by facts, by data, and by the 
best available science.
  The latest data on climate change should be deeply alarming to all of 
us. Last fall, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
released a report based on the research of thousands of our planet's 
leading climate scientists. It laid out in stark terms how critical it 
is for us to find a way to limit the planet's warming. Unless we can 
reduce global carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net-zero 
emissions by 2050, it will be nearly impossible to keep global 
temperatures below a rise of 3 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the 
century.
  I know that is a lot of numbers, but what those numbers mean in terms 
of real ecological, economic, and humanitarian costs is incredibly 
important. Global average temperatures have already risen by nearly 2 
degrees Fahrenheit, and that change is wreaking havoc on communities 
around the world.
  One month after the U.N. released its landmark report, 13 Federal 
Agencies finalized the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' a report 
mandated by Congress to study the evidence and the impacts of current 
climate change. That report provided clear, indisputable evidence that 
the destructive wildfires, the catastrophic hurricanes, and the extreme 
flooding that we have seen in just the last couple of years is directly 
linked to human-caused climate change. These disasters are costing us 
billions of dollars each and every year.
  The Pentagon has correctly called climate change a threat multiplier, 
meaning that climate impacts will amplify the existing threats to our 
national security. These are massive problems today--right now--not in 
some far off future. We need to recognize what the science is telling 
us. We need to recognize that the impacts and the disasters that we 
have seen so far are just the beginning.
  Things are only going to get more chaotic, more unpredictable, and 
more expensive unless we change our trajectory. That is going to 
require global cooperation. It is going to require scientific 
ingenuity, and serious, sober policymaking based on the facts in front 
of us to put us on a better path.
  I am proud that a number of my colleagues are stepping up to think 
through what those actions, what those solutions, and what those 
policies should be. We can have a healthy debate about the best ways to 
achieve these reductions in our emissions, but we can't credibly 
dispute the science, what it is telling us, and the urgency of the need 
to act. These are facts. It is chemistry. Yet, instead of allowing us 
to productively debate those solutions, Majority Leader McConnell is 
planning to waste our time on a political stunt.
  Since Republicans took control of the Senate, they have not brought a 
single bill to the floor that would address emissions--not a single 
one--and they have taken many actions that have actually made the 
situation worse. This is not the serious legislating that we were sent 
here to do. This is not problem-solving.
  The Senate is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. 
We are supposed to come together here on the Senate floor and in our 
committees and think through the greatest issues and challenges of our 
time. We are supposed to propose and debate policies to meet those 
challenges. I would welcome a long overdue debate on what policies 
would most efficiently and most effectively address our challenges.
  I know that climate change often feels too big and too hard to fix, 
but, frankly, we all need to get out of that mindset because climate 
change is a problem we can solve. In fact, climate change is a problem 
that we must solve.
  The good news is that we already have the technologies and the people 
to do it. Clean energy technologies have been evolving rapidly in 
recent years, and many of the clean energy technologies that seemed 
absolutely unrealistic only a decade ago have become


the new normal. I see a future where my two boys will use a reliable, 
cheap, resilient electrical grid that is 100-percent powered by clean 
energy because of the technologies invented in this country and because 
of the technologies built and installed with American labor. We need to 
invest in actually deploying these technologies with the urgency 
necessary to make real progress. This should be a bipartisan priority, 
not only for its impact on curbing carbon emissions but because it will 
create millions of jobs in communities across this country.
  Some States are already moving in this direction. In my home State, 
new wind farms and new solar generation are bringing in billions of 
dollars of private investment. They are creating thousands of new jobs. 
Without aggressive, forward-looking national policies, we will not move 
fast enough. The scale of this transformation will be gigantic. There 
is no doubt about that. But this great Nation is up to the challenge.
  Thank you, Mr. President.",H001046,2019-02-28

558,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,27,Mr. MARKEY,"  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for 
his comments. I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly with the sentiments 
that the gentleman from New Mexico just uttered and the others, the 
Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from New York.
  This is an emergency situation for the planet. How do we know? We 
know because the U.N. scientists at the end of 2018 issued a report 
saying that climate change is an existential threat to our planet. Our 
own U.S. scientists in the end of 2018 issued their own report. This is 
the Trump administration's scientists, much to his chagrin, who said: 
``We must act to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, 
environment, and human health and the well-being over the coming 
decades.''
  These are earth-shattering science reports about the state of our 
planet. These are doomsday reports, which the scientists of our own 
country and the world are giving to us. Yet just 3 weeks ago, the 
``Denier in Chief'' stood before the Congress and delivered a message 
to the American people--not by his words but by the words he did not 
utter, because in an hour and 20 minutes, President Trump did not even 
mention the words ``climate change.'' He did not even mention the words 
``clean energy revolution.''
  President Trump, further, has sent to us a new person to be the head 
of the Environmental Protection Agency. Who is Andrew Wheeler? He is a 
former lobbyist for the coal industry. That is what this Senate will be 
voting on--a coal lobbyist to take over the environment of our country, 
as the scientists of our country tell us that we are facing an 
existential threat if we do not take urgent actions today.
  Our majority leader yesterday called the Green New Deal ``foolish and 
dangerous.'' Well, with all due respect to my Republican colleagues, 
the only thing foolish and dangerous about the Green New Deal is to 
ignore the $400 billion in damages over the last 2 years from 
supercharged storms and wildfires, to ignore the tens of trillions of 
dollars in the damage that we will see from climate change in the 
United States by 2100 if we do not act, and the hundreds of trillions 
of damage across the entire planet if we are not the leader in creating 
a clean-energy revolution.
  What is dangerous, I say to the leader, is sending our men and women 
in the military overseas to protect tankers of oil that are coming into 
our country from the Middle East. Superstorms, wildfires, rising seas, 
and other extreme weather events are the impacts of climate change if 
we do not act boldly to stop it. It isn't just dangerous; it is an 
existential threat to our planet, not from politicians or political 
scientists but from real scientists--``the'' scientists--the Nobel 
Prize-winning scientists of the whole planet and in our own country. 
They are telling us we are in danger, and this body has to take 
positive action to deal with it.
  We have a ``Denier in Chief'' in the White House. We have a 
Republican leader who has brought climate bills to the floor while he 
has been leader, but they have been bills to make the climate even more 
dangerous--the Keystone Pipeline bill and drilling in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge for oil. The Republicans are today going to 
confirm a coal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency, 
which is the Agency charged with protecting the planet.
  The reality is that the Republicans have no plan to deal with the 
climate crisis. That is why they want to short circuit this debate on 
the Green New Deal. Let's have a hearing. Let's hear from experts. 
Let's hear from scientists. Let's have the evidence in the U.S. Senate. 
Then we can decide--but, no, there will be no debate in the Senate on 
science. There will be no debate on the harm that is going to be done 
if we do not act. Instead, in the same period, there will be just an 
attempt to confirm a coal lobbyist to take over the Environmental 
Protection Agency and to derail any real debate on the Green New Deal. 
That is who they are.
  Why is that? It is that the Green New Deal is dangerous. It is 
dangerous for the status quo to just continue to remain in place on 
climate change. It is dangerous for the Koch brothers and those who are 
used to killing every climate debate before it gets a chance to start. 
It is dangerous for those who want us to limp into a frightening future 
with no plan and no protections in place. It is dangerous for those who 
benefit from the continued devaluation of our workers, from the 
historic oppression of vulnerable communities, and from the continued 
destruction of the environment. That is who would think the Green New 
Deal is dangerous.
  The Democrats want to support working families and support a safe 
climate future in which all communities are protected. We welcome 
debate on proposals for how to get there, but the science is clear on 
what we need to do and the magnitude of the response that we have to 
unleash in this country.
  The Republicans may think the Green New Deal is just a resolution, 
but it is more than that. It is a revolution, and it cannot and will 
not be stopped. The science is driving this. It is an intergenerational 
concern that we are heading toward a catastrophe on this planet that 
could have been avoided, but we as a nation have stood on the sidelines 
and have allowed it to happen.
  Ladies and gentlemen, this vote that we take as to whether Andrew 
Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, should be the head of the Environmental 
Protection Agency goes right through the heart of whether we are going 
to respond to the magnitude of this challenge. I do not know how anyone 
can vote for Andrew Wheeler given the science that has been presented 
to us, given the danger that we now know, given the catastrophe that is 
going to be created if we don't change course. This is just doubling 
down on a disaster. Andrew Wheeler is going to be the architect of the 
Republican plan to ensure that we do nothing about this climate 
catastrophe. The consequences could not be greater, but the political 
ramifications in the 2020 elections are going to be great as well. We 
will see a revolution that rises up across this country.

560,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,29,Mr. MERKLEY,"  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau asked: What is the 
use of a home if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?
  We are here at a unique moment in human history when the planet is 
threatened. It is not just our local stream that has been polluted by 
some factory. It is not a river that is so toxic that it catches on 
fire. It is not just a small section of my home State that has been 
afflicted by some new disease in the forests. It is our entire planet 
that is at risk. So any Member of this Chamber who is not coming 
forward to help figure out how to address that is guilty of vast 
malpractice, legislative malpractice, and moral malpractice and 
incompetence because that is what a legislature is about. When there 
are big problems that we face, we come together. We don't ignore them. 
We wrestle with the best way to take them on. That is what this 
conversation is about.
  Senator Carper's resolution says three things, the first of which is 
we have a real problem, and it is easy to demonstrate that. We can take 
a look at all of the information we have coming from every major 
scientific organization that tracks increasing heat on


the planet, but maybe that is a little too complicated. Let's just ask 
a simple question. What have been the hottest years in human history? 
When have they been? Were they in the 1700s, in the 1800s, in the 
1900s? When were those 5 hottest years? They were the last 5 years--
2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. This is no coincidence because that would 
be an astronomically unlikely thing to occur. We have enough science to 
know why this is occurring, not just that it is occurring.
  It is occurring because we are generating carbon dioxide, and we are 
generating methane. They trap heat. We have been told, for the better 
part of a century, that this was going to be a problem, and the problem 
has arrived. It is not some theory. It is not some computer model. It 
is not some ivory tower. The facts are clearly evident. They are 
evident in our forests with longer and hotter fire seasons. They are 
evident in more powerful hurricanes than we have seen before because 
they draw so much more energy from an overheated ocean. We see it in 
the spread of diseases, like Lyme disease with the spread of tick 
populations. We see it with changing species. We see it with glaciers. 
We see it with melting permafrost. We see it with rising sea levels. We 
see it everywhere unless you are blind to the facts. We are not here to 
be blind. We are here to act. So we know the problem is real. That is 
the first point.
  The second point is we know what is causing it--human activities, our 
putting methane into the air and putting carbon dioxide into the air. 
Therefore, we know the third point, which is our responsibility to act.
  So many of us have come forward and have said: Here is an idea. How 
about this? This will completely change the amount of carbon dioxide 
from the transportation sector. Here is an idea. This would really 
change the carbon dioxide generated by power generation, electricity 
generation. How about this? This would greatly reduce the carbon 
dioxide generated from heating buildings.
  Yet, in that conversation, there is the sound of silence from the 
right side of the aisle. Do we hear multitudinous ideas? No. We hear 
none. That is where the legislative malfeasance and where the moral 
irresponsibility lies--in pretending that you can be a leader in this 
country, in this Senate Chamber, and not address this major challenge 
that is afflicting our planet. That is unacceptable. We don't need fake 
and phone debates on the floor of a resolution that hasn't gone through 
committee. We need real discussion and real engagement.
  It was not that long ago that Republican leaders across this Nation 
were taking on this issue. H. W. Bush ran for the Presidency to take on 
climate change. When he got into office, he didn't end up doing a lot, 
but he ran on it and campaigned on it. Other leaders have said we have 
a responsibility to be good stewards of our resources. I have heard 
that from the Republican side of the aisle for my entire lifetime--good 
stewardship. So why the silence now? Why the failure to look at the 
facts? Why the failure to bring forward ideas? This is not OK. We need 
real debate, real discussion.
  I have put forward ideas I would love to see debated, one being that 
we need to dramatically reduce the fossil fuels, which we own as a 
public, coming out of the ground. We have to lead the world, and we 
can't ask the rest of the world not to extract and burn fossil fuels if 
we are still profiting from doing so.
  I laid out the vision--the 100-percent mission in all sectors--and 
how we can get there over the coming decades. It is a 300-page bill 
that is full of ideas. Maybe they are not all the best of ideas, but I 
encourage my colleagues to read them, to find ones they like, and to 
bring forward their ideas. Where do tax credits play in this 
conversation? Where do limits play on pollution? Where do incentives to 
transition to renewable energy come in? Let's have that debate as 
serious policymakers and leaders of this country who are responsible 
for our Nation and for the future of our planet.
  Henry David Thoreau lived a long time ago, but he laid out the point 
that we are responsible for the health of our planet. Let's take that 
responsibility seriously. Let's engage. Let's debate every single idea. 
There are hundreds of them out there. Let's go through them. Let's 
forge a bipartisan plan. Let's not let any industry in America 
contaminate the process, the political process, through these dark 
donations. Let's not, any party in this country, be misled from 
addressing the serious issues before us because they are blinded by the 
hundreds of millions of dollars falling on their campaigns. Let's do 
what we have to do, what we have a responsibility to do. History will 
judge whether we have done that which cannot be delayed. That is our 
responsibility.

562,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,31,Mr. SCHATZ,"  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, as of now, there are zero climate 
proposals coming from Senate Republicans--none. So it becomes 
extraordinarily difficult to debate climate change when only one 
political party is committed to fixing it. I can't underscore this 
enough. I don't know if I can sort of stage direct the C-SPAN cameras, 
but if I can--if they would pan out--they would see an empty Chamber on 
the other side.
  Look, if you don't like our proposals--if you don't like the 
investment tax credit or the production tax credit, if you don't like 
planting trees, if you don't like fuel efficiency standards, if you 
don't like mercury and air quality standards, if you don't like 
investing in high-tech research to find that next breakthrough or if 
you think climate change is a hoax, come down to the Senate floor and 
make your argument. Yet they are not even doing that. This is a 
planetary emergency--the most important moment in human history as it 
relates to the planet Earth--and the party in power is doing its best 
to make the problem worse.
  Democrats want to invest in clean air, clean water, and smarter 
infrastructure. We have taken every chance we can to talk about climate 
and how to fix it. Senator Whitehouse alone has given 200 speeches on 
the Senate floor about the climate crisis.
  The Republican response has been to try to make this silly, to score 
points about something that was posted on a Congresswoman's website and 
promptly removed and to make false statements saying Democrats want to 
ban cheeseburgers or whatever. That is because they don't want to 
debate this issue seriously because they don't have ideas on climate. 
Their only plan is to actively, aggressively make things even worse.
  They need to make this debate about something--anything--other than 
what it is, which is a planet in crisis; weather getting weirder and 
worse, wildfires, coastal flooding, fisheries crashing. Pennsylvania 
farmers say they had the worst season they have had in 30 years because 
of all the rain they got last year, while farmers in the Midwest didn't 
get near enough. It is a rolling disaster happening right now.
  In response, here is what the Republicans have done. They have put 
people who make their money from pollution in charge of regulating 
pollution. They have given oil and gas companies access to millions of 
acres of land and water that are supposed to be protected for things 
like conservation, hunting, hiking. They pulled the United States out 
of the Paris Agreement, which means we are the only country on the 
planet not at the table when it comes to figuring out what to do about 
this problem.
  They have made it easier for companies to put methane in the air or 
make cars that pump pollution into the air, and instead of just leaving 
coal companies alone, instead of saying, hey, let's let the market 
decide, they are actually looking to subsidize coal because now it is 
noncompetitive with wind and solar, in a lot of instances, but they 
actually want to subsidize coal so they can get another 10 or 20 years' 
worth of fossil fuel pollution. This is not what you would do if you 
were trying to stop climate change. This is what you do if you are 
trying to make it worse.
  So let's take a closer look at some of the worst things on their 
list. First, you have to look at the people they have put in charge of 
conserving public lands and keeping air and water clean. This week, the 
Senate is voting on Andrew Wheeler to run the EPA. He is a coal 
lobbyist, and I know politicians are prone to sort of overstatement, 
rhetorical flourishes, but this guy is actually a coal lobbyist. He 
made his living working for coal.


  I don't know him. I presume he is an honorable fellow, but now we are 
supposed to believe he is the best person to keep coal companies in 
line, to make sure they follow the rules and don't hurt the air people 
breathe or the rivers they fish in.
  If this were a movie about corruption in politics, this script would 
be thrown out because it was too obvious.
  Then there is Ryan Zinke, who was supposed to protect public lands 
but instead opened up oil and gas leases at the Department of Interior, 
or the guy regulating Federal energy who denies that climate change is 
real, even though we can all see it with our own eyes. If you don't 
believe the science, you can at least believe your own experience. The 
weather is getting worse and weirder and more severe. He says carbon 
dioxide really isn't a pollutant at all.
  So the nominees have been awful, but the policy is bad too. 
Republicans are trying to pull us out of the Paris Agreement that every 
other country in the world is part of. We are not even trying to lead 
on this planetary emergency, and it means that we give the leadership 
mantle to China to take the lead on how the world is going to fix this 
problem or make it worse, as if Americans should trust China to do what 
is best for our country.
  Then there is the Republican effort to let polluting companies keep 
polluting. The whole reason the EPA exists is to make sure the air we 
breathe, the water we drink and swim in, the land we farm on and live 
on doesn't get polluted, but Republicans have taken control of the EPA 
to get rid of these protections, and they are telling the auto industry 
they no longer need to make cars that put less pollution in the air. 
They have gutted the Clean Power Plan so carbon pollution could be 12 
times worse in the next decade--12 times worse in the next decade.
  Researchers have found it would be better if we had no policy at all 
than if we do the things the Republicans want to do.
  They have let energy companies off the hook for leaking methane and 
made it easier for super pollutants to leak into the air. Again, this 
is the kind of thing you might hear from a politician who is a little 
overheated, a little overly angry, maybe taking a few liberties with 
the truth.
  This is literally what is happening. They literally put a coal 
lobbyist in charge of the EPA. That should be enough for someone on the 
other side to say: Gosh. I can't vote for a coal lobbyist to run the 
EPA. Now, I don't agree with the Democrats about climate change, but I 
can't pretend this thing doesn't happen to my home State. I can't 
pretend Alaska isn't melting or the fisheries aren't crashing or our 
farms aren't having great difficulty or that the floods in South 
Carolina and North Carolina and Florida aren't real, and so we can't 
put a coal lobbyist in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.
  There was a time when the EPA and environmental protection itself was 
not a partisan issue. Here we are in the U.S. Senate--which is the 
place to solve these kinds of problems over the course of this 
country's great history--and every time we come to the floor to talk 
about climate change, it is an empty Chamber on the Republican side. We 
have to do better as a country. We have to do better as a Senate. We 
have to solve climate change together. Future generations are counting 
on us to transcend partisanship and to have this great debate.
  If Leader McConnell wants to bring a resolution, which he thinks is 
clever, to sort of divide Democrats, fine. We are not particularly 
worried about that. We are taking this opportunity to say: Great. Let's 
talk about climate change.
  The first question to ask--the first question to ask--is, what is the 
Republican plan for climate change? Right now, the answer is very 
simple. They have no plan.

564,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,33,Mr. CARPER,"  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, today I am pleased to join with Senators 
Schatz, Merkley, Markey, and others who have spoken to highlight the 
need to act on climate change.
  I said on the floor earlier this week that the Democrats may not yet 
agree on exactly how we must address climate change, but we all agree 
on at least three things: One, climate change is real; two, we as human 
beings are the primary cause of the climate crisis we face today, and 
it has been building for the last almost 100 years; and, three, the 
U.S. Congress--us, the House--should take immediate action to address 
the challenges of climate change.
  That is why I am introducing a resolution today that says those three 
things: Climate change is real. Humans are leading to this crisis we 
face. We have an obligation in this body and the House to do something 
about it.
  Democrats believe in our hearts and our minds that it is possible to 
have a healthy climate and a vibrant, growing economy, and anyone who 
says otherwise is preaching a false choice.
  Sadly, with President Trump in the White House and this 
administration, many of our Republican friends across the aisle have 
chosen to ignore the clear science and threat that climate change poses 
to our children and to their children.
  As we speak about climate change today, this Senate is considering 
the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead EPA. Under Mr. Wheeler's 
leadership, EPA is rolling back climate regulations that will lead to 
more carbon pollution in the air while increasing other air pollution 
that triggers asthma, lung disease, and, in some cases, death.
  Mr. Wheeler claims these actions are needed to provide more business 
certainty. He believes industry is stuck in on old world order. I would 
just say to Andrew Wheeler, as Bob Dylan once said, ``the times they 
are a-changin.''
  Things have changed a lot in the last 15 years. Industry knows where 
the future lies, and that future is in cleaner technologies. Companies 
are making investments now for the next 10 and 20 years down the road. 
They see where the global markets are going. They need to invest in 
clean energy or be left behind.
  Yet, even when industries ask this administration to support climate 
policies that will help the bottom line of those businesses, in too 
many instances, Mr. Wheeler seems to turn a blind eye. In fact, there 
are policies that this administration could support today, right now; 
policies that would dramatically help our climate and our economy.
  One of those policies is the ratification of something called the 
Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol. You say stuff like that, and 
my colleagues' eyes glaze over. So I want to take a minute to talk 
about what they mean.
  The Montreal Protocol, ratified by the United States in 1988, is a 
global environmental agreement mainly focused on phasing down emissions 
that contributed to the hole in the ozone layer. It was not that long 
ago--about the time our pages here were born--that it was a burning 
issue.
  Ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons--we call them 
CFCs for short--were often found in the coolants used to cool food in 
household refrigerators and the air-conditioners in our homes and in 
our cars. CFCs are also found in foams and solvents used in industrial 
processes.
  If there was a poster child for a successful global agreement, I 
think the Montreal Protocol--which most people never heard of--has to 
be that poster child. This agreement has led to a 97-percent reduction 
in the global consumption of ozone-depleting substances with little, if 
any, economic disruption. Think about that.
  Over the years, every administration since the Reagan administration 
has supported the Montreal Protocol and the four amendments associated 
with it.
  However, it turns out a majority of the ozone-depleting substances 
are actually being replaced by something called HFCs, 
hydrofluorocarbons. Those HFCs are easy to use. They are efficient. 
They are safe for the ozone layer. That is good.
  Unfortunately, there is a catch. The HFCs have a global warming 
potential that is thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. On 
the one hand, they are good for the ozone layer; on the other hand, 
they are a killer when it comes to carbon dioxide. So some really smart 
people decided to see what they could do about this, and what those 
smart people did is they came up with a follow-on product to HFCs.
  It is estimated that left unchecked, HFCs could account for 
approximately


20 percent of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050, and that ain't good. So 
by using HFCs, we are fixing one global environmental problem--the hole 
in the ozone--but we are contributing to another, and that is just as 
serious.
  To address this negative side effect, on October 15, 2016, in a place 
called Kigali, which is in Rwanda--that is why they call it the Kigali 
amendment or Kigali treaty--more than 170 countries agreed to amend the 
Montreal Protocol, including ours.
  The goal of this agreement is to achieve more than an 80-percent 
reduction in global HFC production and utilization by 2047. It doesn't 
say you have to stop using it tomorrow. This is a phaseout and a 
phasedown. If we don't do anything by 2047, we will see an increase of 
about half a degree Celsius--that is almost a full degree Fahrenheit--
in global warming by the end of this century. We can't afford to do 
that. Our planet can't afford to do that. Our kids, our grandchildren 
cannot afford for us to do that.
  U.S. industry strongly supports the Kigali amendment because U.S. 
companies have already invested billions of dollars in order to be able 
to produce the next-generation technologies that are going to replace, 
over time, HFCs. Phasing down HFCs allows U.S. companies to capture a 
large portion of a global market that is--listen to this--$1 trillion 
in size, which will create 150,000 new direct and indirect American 
jobs in less than a decade.
  These new jobs are expected to generate close to $39 billion 
dollars--$39 billion--in annual economic benefits for our country; 
again, in less than a decade.
  Industry also believes ratification of the Kigali treaty will 
mitigate unfair Chinese dumping of HFCs in the United States, hurting 
our businesses.
  Ratification of the Kigali amendment is a no-brainer, and even those 
who are skeptical about climate change ought to be able to admit that 
it would be great for U.S. competitiveness and good-paying American 
jobs.
  This is a real win-win situation. If we don't seize the opportunity, 
we should have our heads examined. That is why we have some pretty 
strange bedfellows supporting the Kigali ratification.
  There is a chart behind me. Among others, we have the National 
Association of Manufacturers, Natural Resources development folks, the 
spirit of enterprise, FreedomWorks, the American Chemistry Council, 
Business Roundtable, and Sierra Club.",C000174,2019-02-28

",,2019-02-28
568,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,37,Mr. CORNYN,"  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as strange as it seems, socialism is 
having a bit of a resurgence here in the Nation's Capital these days.
  Why, you might ask, has this failed economic theory that is so 
destructive of individual freedom captured the attention of some of our 
friends in the Democratic Party? I admit, to me, it is somewhat of a 
mystery.
  My guess is I am not the only one who assumed that every American has 
learned the lessons of history and that those lessons are common 
knowledge. Apparently not. One other possibility is that socialism is a 
stalking horse for other, less obvious goals. I will have more to say 
about what the Founders believed about the concentration of government 
power that would be needed to implement these utopian schemes at a 
later time. I also will return to the Senate floor at another time to 
talk about the well-funded efforts, including in the State of Texas, to 
advance the cause of socialism, unbeknownst to most of my fellow 
Texans.
  Maybe self-identified socialists or democratic socialists--by the 
way, that is an impossible contradiction in terms. You can't be 
democratic and a socialist at the same time. Obviously, people put 
those two terms together to try to mask their true intentions.
  Obviously, these self-identified democratic socialists have never 
learned what it is or what it stands for. Recent polling suggests that 
Americans have vastly different ideas about what socialism really 
means. A Gallup poll, for example, found that 23 percent of the people 
who responded understood that it means economic equality--though the 
definition of what equality looks like varies pretty significantly. 
About the same number of people said they didn't know or had no opinion 
of what socialism means. Roughly 17 percent understand it to mean 
government ownership or control of business and the economy.
  There were a variety of answers, ranging from government-guaranteed 
benefits to communism, to people simply being social and getting along. 
That is what some people think socialism is. This confusion about what, 
exactly, socialism is has allowed its supporters to push this 
discredited idea back into the political mainstream.
  The so-called democratic socialists are trying to convince the 
American people that bigger government and less liberty are the 
solutions to economic inequality. But they don't just want economic 
opportunity or equal opportunity; they want equal outcomes. They 
clearly want to put the government in charge of Americans' lives.
  To be sure, they will not be honest about the means by which that 
equality would be accomplished under socialism. They use a lot of feel-
good phrases to mask the consequences of their argument. They say 
things like ``give a voice to the voiceless'' or ``to achieve a more 
just society.'' What they don't tell you is that in order to 
redistribute economic benefits, you would have to marshal the power of 
the government to coerce the American people to give up the fruits of 
their labor in pursuit of socialist, utopian aims.
  While socialists will not tell you what the government would have to 
do to force that redistribution, they like to point to Scandinavian 
countries as a model for socialism's success. But there are some 
problems with that.
  They will say: Look at Denmark. They have free higher education, 
universal healthcare, and subsidized childcare, and they are doing 
great. So, they say, socialism works. But facts are stubborn things. 
For one, Denmark is not a socialist country. Just ask the Danish Prime 
Minister, who said:

       Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is 
     a market economy.

  The left argues: It is still a good model. We want that.
  OK, so how are they paying for all of these programs? It is certainly 
not just from the top 1 percent of the wealthiest of Americans. It is 
the middle class too. Margaret Thatcher once said: ``The problem with 
socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.''

  Let's look at tax rates. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the 
world. In the United States, tax revenue accounts for just over a 
quarter of the size of our economy. In Denmark, it is 50 percent--or 
double.
  Let's also compare our two countries. The population of the country 
of Denmark is roughly 1/60th the population of the United States. In 
terms of landmass, it is about 16,000 square miles. Texas is almost 17 
times the size of Denmark.
  So if the model used in Denmark is, one, not socialism and, two, 
unaffordable, let's instead look for a better example of a country that 
has embraced socialism. I would suggest Venezuela would be a good 
candidate.
  In the late 1990s, then-Presidential Candidate Hugo Chavez delivered 
impassioned speeches promising to lead Venezuela into a socialist 
paradise. He talked about the country's wealth being stolen by evil 
capitalists and greedy corporations and promised hope and change if he 
was elected. That sounds similar to some of the snake oil being sold by 
a number of radical Democrats today. By the way, you don't see caravans 
of people attempting to immigrate to socialist countries like 
Venezuela. It is just the opposite.
  We now know that Chavez's promises were empty and dangerous, and 
while Venezuela certainly saw a lot of change, it wasn't the kind they 
wanted or the kind they expected. The government took over businesses; 
they shut down free markets; and they suppressed free speech. As a 
result, one of the richest countries in the world is now among the 
poorest. Basic commodities like food, medicine, and water are in short 
supply; freedom of the press has disappeared; crime rates have 
skyrocketed; and millions have fled.
  Of course, it is no surprise that self-proclaimed socialists in the 
United


States refuse to accept this as an example of socialism. But this is 
the truth. That is why socialism must be soundly rejected.
  Sir Winston Churchill, who had an incredible gift for words, once 
said:

       The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of 
     blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal 
     sharing of miseries.

  Clearly, misery would be a result of a current fad celebrating 
socialism, and we must firmly and clearly reject it.
  In a society like ours, based on the free enterprise system, business 
owners compete for business and make decisions based on what the 
customer wants and needs, and this helps keep the cost of living low 
while offering consumers choice.
  Competition and free enterprise are the opposite of centrally planned 
and administered socialist economies and the only economic system 
compatible with individual liberty.
  In a socialist country, the government owns or controls everything. 
If you don't like it or insist on going your own way, you will be 
squished like a bug. Socialism forces citizens to be submissive to the 
government's plan--a far cry from the freedoms and liberties promised 
under our Constitution.
  Most Americans don't want the government to run their lives. They 
want less government, which is to say they want more freedom. So while 
things like free healthcare or free higher education or free housing 
sound pretty good superficially, they are a fantasy and part of the 
agenda to move the United States toward a socialist, government-
controlled economy.
  Under our free enterprise system, people work to earn their living. 
The harder you work, the more you benefit and the better you can 
provide for yourself and your family. That is something we call the 
American dream. But with socialism, that kind of motivation doesn't 
exist at all. Why would you put in the extra effort? Why would you work 
longer hours when you will receive the same pay and benefits as 
everybody else? Why would you pursue an advanced degree and pour your 
heart into researching new medical cures when you know, at the end of 
the day, the person who chooses to do nothing will receive the same 
benefits you do? Well, you wouldn't. That is why socialism doesn't 
work.
  In a recent Washington Post column, George Will defined today's 
understanding of socialism as this:

       Almost everyone will be nice to almost everyone, using 
     money taken from a few. This means having government 
     distribute, according to its conception of equity, the wealth 
     produced by capitalism.

  The problem is, as he said, the government will take and take until 
eventually there is nothing more to take. Once that happens, the 
economy will tank; jobs will dry up; taxes will get higher to pay for 
the benefits promised; and those utopian sentiments will not feel quite 
so good anymore.
  The enemy of socialism isn't greed. It is experience. That is why 
there are no socialist success stories. Venezuela, the Soviet Union, 
Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania--time and again, we have seen socialism 
fail. That has been the universal experience.
  As President Trump said in Miami last week:

       Socialism promises prosperity, but it delivers poverty. 
     Socialism promises unity, but it delivers hatred and it 
     delivers division. Socialism promises a better future, but it 
     always returns to the darkest chapters of the past.

  Slapping the word ``democratic'' in front of the word ``socialism'' 
doesn't make it any less radical or any less terrifying. In fact, 
democracy and socialism are at war with each other.
  This is not about lifting up the poor. It is about taking our freedom 
away and turning it over to our government overlords and taskmasters.
  As so many seem to have forgotten the lessons of history, I plan to 
return to the Senate floor to discuss this disturbing trend further and 
remind the American people why socialism is the enemy, not a friend, of 
our country.",C001056,2019-02-28

",,2019-02-28
571,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,40,Mr. CARPER,"  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I say to our colleagues that I stand 
before you today as a Vietnam veteran--5 years of naval service during 
the hot war in Southeast Asia, trying to make sure that the force of 
communism was stopped. I served another 18 years beyond that, right to 
the end of the Cold War, as a naval flight officer and retired as a 
Navy captain.
  I am not a socialist. I am somebody who cares deeply about this 
planet. I am someone who believes it is possible to have clean air, 
clean water, better public health, and to foster economic growth.
  As it turns out, there are a lot of companies in this country that 
believe the same thing. They believe the same thing. A lot of them 
build cars, trucks, and vans. They want a 50-State deal on fuel 
efficiency standards, CAFE standards, and tailpipe standards. They want 
a 50-State deal so they don't have to build a car for 13 or 14 
different States and then a different kind of car or truck for the rest 
of the country. They don't want to do that. They want certainty and 
predictability so they can build one model for one car. They want to be 
able to be successful in competing in the world marketplace in the next 
10, 20, or 30 years.
  We need someone leading the Environmental Protection Agency who 
believes that it is possible to have cleaner air and, frankly, to 
foster economic growth in the auto companies. That is what the auto 
companies want. They are not socialists. They are free-marketers.
  There is something called HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons. It is a 
terrible pollutant for the environment. It is 1,000 times worse than 
carbon for our global warming challenges. There are a bunch of American 
businesses that have new technology to replace HFCs. They want to be 
able not just to develop it, but they want to able to sell it all over 
the world. The marketplace is $1 trillion, and we are holding it back.
  Unfortunately, the person whom we are going to be voting on here 
today to be our EPA Administrator is part of holding us back because he 
will not agree to a treaty that the administration wants to put 
forward. It is crazy.
  Those companies that developed the follow-on products to HFCs--
Honeywell, Chemours, and others--are not socialists. They are business 
people. They want a piece of the international market, and they want to 
do good things for the climate at the same time.
  I just want to say to my colleagues: We can do both. We can have 
clean air. We can have clean water. We can have strong economic growth. 
We need somebody running the EPA who actually believes in that too. I 
am sorry to say here today that right now I don't believe it is Andrew 
Wheeler, and I say that with no joy.
  Thank you very much.",C000174,2019-02-28
572,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,41,Mr. DURBIN,"  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, throughout the country and in the great 
State of Illinois, a host of environmental issues are plaguing 
Americans. From air pollution, to groundwater contamination, to the 
increases in climate change-related harm that we are already facing, 
there is no more crucial time to have strong national leadership on 
environmental issues than right now. However, in the midst of all these 
issues comes the nomination of Andrew Wheeler--a former lobbyist for 
corporate polluters--to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
  If there is one major thing we have learned from the Clean Air Act, 
it is that regulations save lives and money. Regulations that ensure 
clean air mean fewer premature deaths and health issues, as well as 
fewer asthma attacks in children and health-related missed work days. 
However, the EPA under this administration that is now led by Acting 
Administrator Wheeler, consistently works to roll back clean air and 
water rules. This exposes the most vulnerable members of our society--
including children and the elderly--to toxic and deadly chemicals. The 
people in Illinois are no exception. We are facing several 
environmental issues in Illinois that require immediate action by the 
EPA, and so far, I am not satisfied that EPA is doing everything it can 
and should be doing under Mr. Wheeler's leadership.
  The Sterigenics facility is causing is a public health threat in 
Willowbrook, IL due to emissions from cancer-causing ethylene oxide. 
The EPA's own risk assessment from 2016, showed that ethylene oxide 
exposure increases the risk of cancer more than what was previously 
thought. However, given this


information, the EPA has still not taken sufficient actions to protect 
people of Willowbrook who are exposed to this gas. Concerns about 
ethylene oxide exposure is not limited to the people of Willowbrook--it 
is also of concern to the people of Gurnee and Waujkegan, IL who also 
have plants that use ehtylene oxide in the middle of their towns. Every 
time I have spoken with Acting Administrator Wheeler about this issue, 
I have been disappointed by the lack of urgency to do anything more 
than monitor and collect more data. When it comes to the facilities in 
Gurnee and Waukegan, the EPA won't even commit to monitor and collect 
data, even though I have joined my colleague Senator Duckworth in 
requesting that monitoring begin immediately. The EPA is 4 years 
overdue to begin the process to promulgate new standards for this gas, 
even though they know the increased cancer risk. So I, along with my 
colleague Senator Duckworth and my colleagues in the House, introduced 
legislation to require the EPA to promulgate new rules for ethylene 
oxide. However, the EPA's failure to act to limit toxic chemicals being 
emitted into neighborhoods does not end with ethylene oxide. There is 
manganese pollution on the Southeast side of Chicago. Manganese 
exposure results in serious neurological effects, such as learning 
difficulties, lower IQ scores in children, and manganese poisoning--a 
condition that resembles Parkinson's disease. There are several 
facilities on the Southeast side of Chicago that emit manganese, and 
EPA is now monitoring these facilities after my colleague Senator 
Duckworth and I pressed EPA to do so. These facilities contaminate both 
the air that people breathe and the soil that children play on.
  Although the EPA knows how dangerous this neurotoxin is and how high 
the concentrations are, they will not commit to strengthening manganese 
standards or take immediate action to clean up sites with soil 
contamination. We need someone at the EPA that will be aggressive in 
enforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
  We also need an EPA Administrator who recognizes how urgent it is to 
address climate change. The Trump administration's own Department of 
Defense issued a report last month identifying national security 
threats to defense missions, operations, and installations, due to 
climate change. Yet Acting Administrator Wheeler continues to undermine 
independent science for climate change by appointing members to the 
EPA's Scientific Advisory Board who are biased by industry or actively 
deny that climate change is a problem. How can we expect the EPA to 
lead efforts to address climate change if its leadership doesn't 
believe it requires immediate action?
  I would also like to mention one more thing before I close. This 
administration promised farmers, biorefineries, and fuels stations that 
they would ensure stations could sell E15 fuels this summer. The EPA is 
coming close to failing to fulfil that promise. I hope the EPA will 
work with me to ensure stations are able to sell E15 fuels this summer.
  We need someone leading the EPA who will put the health and well-
being of the people of this country above the profits of corporate 
polluters. We need someone who is willing to protect families and 
communities from toxic chemicals in our air and water by fully 
enforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. And we need 
someone who will lead the charge to address climate change. I am not 
convinced that Acting Administrator Wheeler will do these things. As a 
result, I cannot support his nomination. I hope he proves me wrong.",D000563,2019-02-28
573,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,42,Mrs. FEINSTEIN,"  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my 
opposition to confirming Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency.
  His lobbying activities and tenure, first as Deputy, then as Acting 
Administrator, show that he should not be leading the EPA in a 
permanent capacity.
  We are at a crossroads for action on climate change. The United 
Nations issued a special report in October, warning of the catastrophic 
consequences of allowing global warming to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius.
  The report warned that human activity has already caused about 1 
degree of warming and that we need to drastically cut emissions--45 
percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050--to stay below 1.5 degrees.
  The EPA is the strongest institution we have in the United States to 
combat climate change in terms of technical expertise and legal 
authority. Unfortunately, I fear that, if the EPA remains under the 
leadership of Andrew Wheeler, it will continue dismantling critical 
regulations and rolling back previous efforts to address climate 
change.
  Andrew Wheeler is a former coal and fossil fuel lobbyist. Despite a 
duty to serve the public's interest, he has instead worked to push a 
counterproductive agenda of deregulation at the EPA.
  During Mr. Wheeler's EPA tenure, the Trump administration has 
aggressively moved to undermine numerous greenhouse gas emission 
regulations. This includes President Obama's landmark Clean Power Plan, 
performance standards for new power plants, and methane emission 
standards for the oil and gas industry.
  I am most concerned that Andrew Wheeler is overseeing the Trump 
administration's efforts to roll back our national program for motor 
vehicle emission standards, an issue that I have worked on for decades.
  Under the current program, fuel economy standards for new cars and 
SUVs are set to exceed 50 miles per gallon by 2025. To date, these 
standards have saved 550 million barrels of oil, $65 billion in fuel 
costs for American families, and 250 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide.
  The success of these standards comes, in part, from the fact that 
they have been implemented as a single, coordinated national program 
under the authority of the EPA, the Department of Transportation, and 
the State of California.
  The Department of Transportation implements the Ten-in-Ten Fuel 
Economy Act, which was signed into law in 2007 following a bipartisan 
legislative effort over the course of many years. I was proud to work 
together with our former colleague Olympia Snowe of Maine and many 
others from both parties to strengthen the Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy standards for the first time in three decades.
  This law requires fuel economy standards to increase by at least 10 
miles per gallon by 2020. Beyond 2020, the law requires standards to be 
set at the maximum feasible level based on available technology, which 
the administration is trying to avoid doing for 2022-2026.
  For its part, the EPA implements complementary vehicle emission 
standards under the Clean Air Act. That law also recognizes 
California's longstanding authority to regulate its own air pollution 
and allows other States to choose to follow California's standards in 
lieu of Federal requirements, as 13 States have now done.
  Today these standards are collectively implemented as a single 
national program under a 2012 agreement between the Department of 
Transportation, the EPA, and the State of California that applies 
through model year 2025.
  Unfortunately, the Trump administration is working to tear up that 
agreement and weaken Federal standards starting in 2022. Last week, the 
administration announced it would refuse to negotiate with California 
to salvage this program. Instead of seeking consensus, the EPA, 
overseen by Mr. Wheeler, is proposing to challenge California's 
longstanding authority. These actions are unjustified and will only 
create chaos and uncertainty for the automobile market.
  Under Mr. Wheeler's watch, the Trump administration has also 
continued to roll back or undermine many other important EPA 
environmental health and safety regulations.
  From attempts to undermine effective Mercury and Air Toxics 
Standards, to evading the EPA's commitments to set safe drinking water 
standards, to failing to fully implement the Toxic Substances Control 
Act, it is clear that Mr. Wheeler will only continue his efforts to 
dismantle the EPA from within.
  I was a proud supporter of the bipartisan Frank R. Lautenberg 
Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which passed in 2016. This 
bill amends and updates the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the 
Nation's primary


chemicals management law. Thousands of Californians rely on it to 
safeguard against exposure to toxic chemicals we encounter every day.
  EPA is charged with protecting all Americans from undue and harmful 
exposure to existing and newly introduced chemicals. However, under the 
Trump administration, the EPA's safety reviews of toxic substances has 
fallen far short of the intent of this sweeping, bipartisan toxic 
chemical reform legislation.
  One example of a chemical that I am very concerned about is asbestos. 
As a result of the administration's lack of action, my colleagues in 
the Senate and I introduced legislation in 2017 that would have amended 
the Toxic Substances Control Act to require the EPA to identify and 
assess all forms of asbestos and ultimately ban this known carcinogen.
  This bill was named after Alan Reinstein, who passed away in 2006 at 
the age of 66 from mesothelioma, a disease caused by exposure to 
asbestos. Delays in banning asbestos have meant that as many as 15,000 
Americans die each year from exposure.
  During Wheeler's tenure, the EPA has resisted calls to eliminate 
exemptions for asbestos in the current Chemical Data Reporting rule, a 
reporting requirement under the Toxic Substances Control Act, to comply 
with its mandate to prevent unreasonable risks to health and the 
environment presented by asbestos.
  Despite knowing the health risks for decades, asbestos is still used 
in a wide variety of construction materials that the public unwittingly 
comes into contact with every day.
  Andrew Wheeler's tenure at the EPA, both as Deputy Administrator for 
the EPA and as Acting Administrator, has shown a clear disregard for 
the EPA's mission to protect the public and the environment. I urge all 
of my colleagues to oppose his confirmation.

577,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1555-6,46,Mr. INHOFE,"  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much, Madam President.
  Madam President, we are going to vote in just a few minutes to 
confirm Andrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. There is no one better to serve in this role, and I 
would know. Andrew worked for me for 14 years in both my personal 
office as well as in my capacity as chairman of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee.
  He was with the committee back when President Trump nominated Andrew 
as Deputy Administrator. I said: There is no one more qualified. There 
is no one more qualified anywhere in America to handle this job than 
Andrew Wheeler.
  He has been Acting Administrator for the last 7 months. Let's keep in 
mind that he was the most qualified person 7 months ago, and now he has 
had 7 months on the job, and he has done a really great job. He has 
been the Acting Administrator.
  It didn't really start when he came on board with any of the 
governmental Agencies. He has always been concerned about nature and 
the environment. The guy was an Eagle Scout.
  In fact, I remember the discussions of people who were with him when 
he was actually climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. It was with a group of 
people who were interested in nature and the environment. This came 
early on with him. So he has the ability to lead the Agency.
  I have always enjoyed following his career. After earning a law 
degree at Washington University in St. Louis, he joined the EPA as a 
special assistant in the Agency's Pollution Prevention and Toxics 
Office in 1991. I am talking about 30 years ago. This guy has been 
there for a long time. For all practical purposes, he has grown up in 
that particular discipline.
  He was an EPA employee for 4 years, transitioning to the George H. W. 
Bush administration and then the Clinton administration after that, 
where he earned three Bronze Medals for commendable service along the 
way.
  By the way, I doubt if there are too many people in this Chamber who 
know what that is. So I am going to read it to you.
  The Bronze Medal is given for ``significant service or achievements 
in support of the Agency's mission or for demonstration of outstanding 
accomplishments in supervision and leadership.''
  That is Andrew Wheeler. He received three of those.
  I know you have heard a lot of people opposing him. Regretfully, 
there are a lot of people opposed simply for the reason that this is a 
nominee of the President. We went through this with Mr. Kavanaugh. We 
heard all of these things, and people now look back, and many of them 
regret that they said the things that they said.
  It is awfully hard to be critical of Andrew because he is such a nice 
guy.
  He left the Agency. He brought the sense of service and leadership 
with him to the U.S. Senate, where I had a front-row seat because he 
worked for me for 14 years.
  He just did really tremendous work. There were never any complaints 
about him. He knew what he was doing. Again, with a 31-year background, 
there is nothing that he doesn't know about the mission.
  Andrew started in my personal office as chief counsel and 
transitioned to staff director for a Senate subcommittee. I was a 
subcommittee chairman at the time on the subcommittee called the Clean 
Air, Climate Change, Wetlands, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. He was 
the one who did all the work, and I took the credit, but it worked.
  In 2003, when I became the chairman of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee, Andrew became our chief counsel. Over the next 6 
years, he would eventually become staff director and we worked closely 
together on highway bills, energy bills, the Diesel Emissions Reduction 
Act, and the Clear Skies Act.
  I can remember when this was taking place because someone who was a 
very close friend of mine and is no longer here, Barbara Boxer from 
California, worked together on these things. It was really kind of 
funny. Philosophically, we were opposed to each other as much as two 
people could be, but we accomplished everything. We accomplished the 
things that other people were not able to accomplish.
  It is only natural that the President would nominate Andrew to be the 
Deputy Director at that time of the EPA. That was last April. He was 
confirmed in a bipartisan vote.
  I will always remember that he gave a speech over at the EPA. It was 
kind of a welcome speech at that time. That was the day that he was 
confirmed as Deputy Director of the EPA. I think every single employee 
was in there, really, to kind of pay homage to him. It is a big deal. 
Here is a guy who started 30 years ago at the bottom. He is just a 
normal person in the bureaucracy, and all of a sudden--not all of a 
sudden, it took him almost 30 years to do it--he climbs up to become 
Deputy Director. So he was really a model. He was a model to those 200 
or 300 people.
  Andrew didn't even know this as he was making his initial speech, but 
I watched the looks on their faces, and the model that he was for them 
was that there is room at the top. Here is a guy who climbed all the 
way up, and he reached the top.
  He knows what it takes to ensure that our environment is cared for 
within the laws passed by Congress. He will ensure that all 
stakeholders are heard, and he will provide certainty and stability for 
the regulated community. That is a switch.
  One of the reasons I ran for Congress in the first place many years 
ago was the fact that I was a builder and developer and I was 
overregulated. I know what it is like firsthand. He will be a good 
steward of the environment without punishing our States, without 
punishing our farmers, and without punishing our job creators just for 
the sake of it. Those days are behind us.
  Andrew has worked on these issues for his entire 28-year career, and 
I am honored that he chose to spend half of his 14 years working for 
me. So I have directly benefited from his service. The U.S. Senate has 
benefited from his leadership, and now America will benefit as well.
  Let's vote Andrew in and put him to work.

584,BAHRAIN,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1590,0,Mr. WYDEN,"  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, February marks the anniversary of the 
massive, peaceful protests against Bahrain's repressive regime in 2011. 
Bahraini citizens, men and women of all ages and backgrounds, demanded 
more accountability from their leaders and more agency in their lives.
  Instead of sitting down with the protestors as leaders in Oregon or 
Washington, DC, often do, Bahrain's rulers unleashed the country's 
security forces on them. I am afraid that it has now become a rather 
sad tradition of mine to remind the Senate of these events, and so 
before February gives way to March, I just wanted to offer a few words 
on why this issue continues to resonate.
  Bahrain held elections in November 2018, but they were hardly on the 
level. ``The Economist'' termed them ``unfair.'' The head of Human 
Rights First called them ``fake elections.'' The Project on Middle East 
Democracy and Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain said 
they were a ``sham.'' The list goes on.
  This should come as no surprise to anybody paying attention to 
development in Bahrain because the regime banned opposition parties 
from participating altogether. That is not exactly a recipe for a free, 
fair, or legitimate outcome.
  Indeed, the regime has spent the past couple years detaining, 
intimidating, and silencing the political opposition.
  But don't take my word for it, that's how Amnesty International 
characterized the situation before the November elections.
  The repression extends far beyond the ballot box. Human rights 
advocates say the regime has arbitrarily stripped hundreds of 
individuals of their citizenship in the past few years.
  Human Right Watch indicates that the regime closed the last remaining 
independent newspaper in 2017. Freedom House says the regime continues 
to bully journalists and to persecute those who are critical of the 
regime.
  Bahrain is a longtime U.S. ally in a tumultuous region. My intent 
with these annual statements is neither to insult the Kingdom nor to 
demand the administration cut ties.
  No, the point of these statements is to make it clear that I believe 
the United States should always promote basic rights and values and 
further, that I believe the United States must--must--hold its friends 
and partners to a higher moral standard.
  I was concerned that the previous administration did not do more to 
push Bahrain's rulers on this point, but I am deeply disappointed that 
the Trump administration seems hell-bent on setting a new low.
  The President himself has made clear that he views the world through 
a transactional lens and is willing to overlook rights violations in 
the name of arms sales or greater defense cooperation.
  So it is hardly surprising to read that Trump administration 
officials fail to raise human rights concerns with their Bahraini 
counterparts.
  This must change. I hope it will change. And I hope that the influx 
of new members of Congress following the 2018 midterm elections will 
cause it to change.
  Today I renew my call on Bahrain's monarchy to stop brutally 
repressing peaceful protest, to release political prisoners like 
Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and Nabeel Rajab, and to offer Bahrainis a greater 
voice in their country's future.

Island in the First Congressional District of Georgia for breaking 
ground on a brand-new Marine Science Center.
  After years of hard work and planning by Tybee residents, local 
officials, business leaders, engineers, and so many other individuals, 
a ceremony was held on February 25 to celebrate the start of 
construction.
  Scheduled to open in March of 2020, the programs at the current 
Marine Science Center have been enormously successful. One program 
called Sidewalk to the Sea has been able to reach more than 40,000 kids 
and educate them about the nearby Atlantic Ocean, which sits only a few 
hundred yards away from the facility.
  Additionally, the new Marine Science Center will include interpretive 
exhibits, an amphitheater, a shark school, animal rescue activities, a 
dune habitat trail, and more.
  It is so encouraging to see the residents of this local community 
taking steps to appreciate our oceans, while educating old and young 
alike on ways that they can pitch in to preserve them.
  Congratulations, and keep up the good work.

591,IN MEMORY OF JUDGE KEVIN P. McMAHON,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE232-5,0,Mr. COURTNEY,"  Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise with great sadness to honor the 
life of Connecticut Superior Court Judge Kevin P. McMahon of Niantic, 
Connecticut who died too young at the age of 68 on February 18, 2019.
  Madam Speaker, when news of Kevin's passing became known all across 
the state, there was an enormous outflowing of tributes and praise for 
the man described as ``The People's Judge'' for his amazing service in 
the criminal courts for over twenty-five years. He presided over big 
cases and small cases with great skill, displaying a warm and caring 
personality that balanced courtesy and adherence to the law with 
compassion for all who appeared before him. He had a sharp, delightful 
sense of humor and the court staff in every region he sat were 
professionally loyal to him because he treated them all with kindness 
and respect. He believed strongly in sharing his knowledge with his 
colleagues on the bench. He was an instructor at the Connecticut 
Judges' Institute and fellow judges often sought his advice on cases. 
Kevin was the president, and lone member, of the Black Point Judges 
Association, a position he was honored to hold. His knowledge of the 
law, his sense of humor, and, most importantly, his sense of fairness 
governed his decisions and made him a great judge.
  Kevin was the past president of the New London/Washington County 
Providence College Alumni Club. He mentored students from Providence 
College, many of whom shadowed him during his time on the bench. The 
college honored him by presenting him with the Faithful Friar Award, 
and he was a season ticket holder for Providence College Basketball for 
many years.
  Kevin spent summers at Black Point Beach at his family's summer home. 
Eventually, Patti and he became year-round residents. He was a member 
of the Black Point Association for many years. Kevin loved being a part 
of the beach community and over the years skillfully captained an array 
of powerboats. He was an avid reader and a serious student of history. 
Kevin was a sports enthusiast, as a loyal fan of the New York Giants, 
the Boston Red Sox, Boston Celtics and had great admiration for Tom 
Brady.
  Kevin was also a devoted husband to the love of his life Patti 
McMahon and they had many happy years together at Black Point Beach 
which they made their permanent home. Patti is a highly skilled 
paralegal who worked for one of the premier law firms in Hartford--
Riscassi and Davis--and their shared experience in the legal profession 
made them the perfect couple.
  Mr. Speaker, I had known Kevin for many years when we were interns at 
the Hartford


Superior Criminal Court back in the 1970s. I knew from the first day we 
met that he was a special person whose sharp mind, quick wit, and 
infectious sense of humor stood out immediately. He was born to be a 
judge and it was wonderful to watch someone find the perfect spot on 
the bench to express his talents to the fullest.
  Mr. Speaker we live in a time when cheap politics and cynical 
journalism constantly seek to delegitimize the importance of a strong, 
respected, independent judiciary. Kevin McMahon's life and record are 
the best rebuttal to this corrosive, dangerous trend. All who came in 
contact with him could believe in the honesty and goodness of our 
judicial system by observing the grace and integrity of his service. 
His example will be one for the ages.
  Colleagues, please join me in expressing the condolences of the 
chamber for his friends and family--particularly his beloved wife 
Patti.

funding for his ineffective and overpriced border wall, President Trump 
has declared a national emergency at our southern border to try and 
sidestep Congress's constitutional authority so he can fulfill a 
campaign promise.
  After the President shut down the government for 35 days, my 
colleagues and I came to an agreement that wisely invested in effective 
solutions to secure the border. Some of these solutions included 
infrastructure improvements at ports of entry, the hiring of additional 
immigration judges and technology enhancements to detect border 
crossings. Clearly, with this national emergency declaration, the 
president and his administration would rather stick to a slogan than 
actually secure the border.
  The emergency declaration signed by the president would rob taxpayer 
money from high priority military construction projects, including 
projects in the state of Texas, and instead redirects that funding 
towards his pet project. This egregious misuse of taxpayer funds leaves 
our country less safe by denying military personal the essential 
training, readiness and quality of life necessary for them to do their 
job.
  This unlawful action by the President cannot be tolerated. I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this joint resolution of disapproval so 
that we can do our solemn duty and uphold the Constitution.

600,HONORING DR. ADOLPHUS HAILSTORK,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE231,0,Mr. TONKA,"  Mr. TONKA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the work of Dr. 
Adolphus Hailstork.
  Dr. Hailstork is a leading composer and professor who has dedicated 
his life to the study, composition, and continuation of musical 
excellence. He has written numerous works for chorus, chamber 
ensembles, piano, organ, band and orchestra, which are performed and 
celebrated around the world.
  Born in Rochester, NY, but raised in Albany, Dr. Hailstork's 
remarkable musical career can be traced back to his membership in the 
historic Cathedral of All Saints Choir of Men and Boys, the oldest 
continually performing ensemble of its kind in the United States. His 
membership in the Choir was the catalyst to more than seventy years of 
creative expression and musical prowess.
  Since his time with the Choir, he has pursued a career in music with 
relentless dedication. During his years at Albany High School, he began 
composing music regularly. He received degrees from Howard University 
and the Manhattan School of Music and studied in France with famed 
composer and teacher Nadia Boulanger before receiving his doctorate 
from Michigan State University in 1971.
  What makes Dr. Hailstork truly admirable is not only his aptitude in 
making music, but his desire and skill in teaching it, passing on his 
substantial knowledge to future musicians. He has served as professor 
at Youngstown State University in Ohio and at Norfolk State University 
in Virginia. Currently, he works as a professor of music and Composer-
in-Residence at Old Dominion University in Norfolk.
  One of the most incredible aspects of music is its ability to connect 
individuals of all ages and backgrounds. Dr. Hailstork's work 
exemplifies this idea. He has studied, composed and taught a vast range 
of musical styles and genres, focusing on classical compositions with a 
blend of African American and European traditions. His masterful 
compositions have been performed by the New York Philharmonic, Chicago 
Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and numerous other prestigious 
orchestras.
  This year marks the 60th anniversary of Dr. Hailstork's graduation 
from Albany High School. Since his time in New York's Capital Region, 
he has left an imprint on the districts culture and society that will 
not soon fade.
  On behalf of the United States Congress, it is my great honor and 
privilege to recognize Dr. Hailstork's accomplishments. I offer my 
gratitude for his immeasurable dedication and wish him continued 
success in the years to come.

congratulations to Lieutenant Eric Jimenez, a resident of Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, on eight years of dedicated active duty service to our 
Country in the United States Navy.
  Lt. Jimenez currently serves as an Operations Research Analyst in the 
Naval Service Warfare Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He entered the USN 
in 2011, and served in numerous assignments and deployments throughout 
his distinguished career.
  Lt. Jimenez has shown not only outstanding leadership, but uncommon 
technical skill. As a Reactor Control Officer on the USS Santa Fe, he 
managed a team of nine nuclear trained electronics technicians charged 
with maintaining nuclear reactor protection systems. He further trained 
an underperforming division by implementing a rigorous training and 
monitoring program resulting in a two-letter grade improvement in all 
categories of the Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination (ORSE). As 
an Electrical Division Officer, Lt. Jimenez maintained a 100 percent 
electrical safety training performance and executed the ship's 
electrical safety program using the most up-to-date instructions and 
notices. As Assistant Weapons Officer, Lt. Jimenez led his team through 
several weapons exercises, earning the 2015 Commanders Submarines 
Squadron SEVEN Battle Efficiency and the Submarine Squadron Seven 
Weapons Excellence White ``W'' award.
  Since November of 2016, Lt. Jimenez has led four studies, valued at 
$3 million dollars, in the development, analysis, and interpretation of 
results of Defense Planning Scenarios designed to inform and influence 
Navy senior executive leadership. He further served as a co-chair on 
Technical Evaluation Boards, overviewing contract proposals worth an 
estimated $1.5 million.
  On behalf of Oklahoma's First Congressional District, I commend and 
congratulate my constituent, Lieutenant Eric Jimenez, on his devoted 
service to the United States of


America. May we learn from this young man the virtues of self-sacrifice 
and fidelity to our beloved Nation.

606,INTRODUCTION OF THE SECURING DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FIREARMS ACT,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE230-3,0,Mr. CORREA,"  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, regrettably, there have been too many 
instances in which Department of Homeland Security officers have 
misplaced or lost their Department-issued firearms due to a failure to 
properly secure such sensitive assets.
  In October 2017, the DHS Office of Inspector General found that 2,142 
sensitive assets--including 228 firearms and 1,889 badges--were 
misplaced between fiscal years 2014 and 2016. Most of these losses were 
due to DHS personnel who did not properly safeguard such sensitive 
assets. The Office of Inspector General identified the lack of a 
Department-wide firearm policy as a major reason why sensitive assets 
were not secured.
  Therefore, I am introducing the Securing Department of Homeland 
Security Firearms Act, which improves the accountability of DHS-issued 
firearms and other sensitive assets. Specifically, the bill directs DHS 
to develop and distribute a Department-wide directive for achieving 
adequate security over firearms and other sensitive assets. That 
directive must include reporting and recordkeeping requirements for 
lost assets. Additionally, the bill requires that DHS provide officers 
with training and guidance on how to follow safeguarding requirements 
and how to properly report the loss or theft of a firearm.
  Due to its mission, DHS has a variety of highly sensitive equipment. 
Failure to safeguard those assets can have grave consequences for 
public safety and homeland security. This measure will foster greater 
accountability and security within DHS.

607,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1595-2,0,Mr. REED,"  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity 
Disclosure Act along with two members of the Select Committee on 
Intelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Warner, 
in addition to Senator Kennedy and Senator Jones, who also serve with 
me on the Senate Banking Committee. In response to data breaches of 
various companies that exposed the personal information of millions of 
customers, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to 
include--in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to 
investors--information on whether any member of the board of directors 
is a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having this expertise on the 
board of directors is not necessary because of other cybersecurity 
steps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the 
legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than 
to provide this disclosure to its investors.
  In Deloitte's 11th Global Risk Management Survey of financial 
services institutions, published last month, ``sixty-seven percent of 
respondents named cybersecurity as one of the three risks that would 
increase the most in importance for their business over the next two 
years, far more than for any other risk. Yet, only about one-half of 
the respondents felt their institutions were extremely or very 
effective in managing this risk.'' According to the 2018-2019 National 
Association of Corporate Directors Public Company Governance Survey, 
only 52 percent of directors ``are confident that they sufficiently 
understand cyber risks to provide effective cyber-risk oversight,'' and 
58 percent ``believe their boards collectively know enough about cyber 
risk to provide effective oversight.'' Indeed, Yahoo, in its 2016 
annual report, disclosed, ``the Independent Committee found that 
failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting 
contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 
2014 Security Incident. The Independent Committee also found that the 
Audit and Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately 
informed of the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014 
Security Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident 
here refers to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account 
information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from 
Yahoo's network in late 2014.''
  This is particularly troubling given that data breaches expose more 
and more records containing personally identifiable information. 
Indeed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of 
these types of records exposed by data breaches in the business 
industry grew from 181,630,520 in 2017 to 415,233,143 in 2018 and in 
the medical and healthcare industry from 5,302,846 in 2017 to 9,927,798 
last year. Across all industries, the number of records containing 
personally identifiable information exposed by data breaches rose 126 
percent, from 197,612,748 in 2017 to 446,515,334 in 2018.
  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether 
publicly traded companies are prioritizing cybersecurity and have the 
capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber related attacks. 
Our legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues 
through improved SEC disclosure.
  In testimony given to the Senate Banking Committee last June, Harvard 
Law Professor John Coates, who also practiced securities law as a 
partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, expressed support for our 
legislation by stating that ``[the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act] is 
well designed. It does not attempt to second-guess SEC guidance and 
rules regarding disclosures generally, or even as to cyber-risk 
overall. The bill simply asks publicly traded companies to disclose 
whether a cybersecurity expert is on the board of directors, and if 
not, why one is not necessary. To be clear, the bill does not require 
every publicly traded company to have a cybersecurity expert on its 
board. Publicly traded companies will still decide for themselves how 
to tailor their resources to their cybersecurity needs and disclose 
what they have decided. Some companies may choose to hire outside cyber 
consultants. Some may choose to boost cybersecurity expertise on staff. 
And some may decide to have a cybersecurity expert on the board of 
directors. The disclosure required would typically amount to a sentence 
or two.''
  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking 
Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my 
service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on 
Intelligence. Through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence 
perspective, I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our 
national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy 
becomes ever more dependent on technology and the internet.
  Indeed, General Darren W. McDew, the former commander of U.S. 
Transportation Command, which is charged with moving our military 
assets to meet our national security objectives in partnership with the 
private sector, offered several sobering assessments during an April 
10, 2018 hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He stated 
that ``cyber is the number one threat to U.S. Transportation Command, 
but I believe it is the number one threat to the nation . . . in our 
headquarters, cyber is the commander's business, but not everywhere 
across our country is cyber a CEO's business . . . in our cyber 
roundtables, which is one of the things we are doing to raise our level 
of awareness, some of the CEO's chief security officers cannot even get 
to the see the board, they cannot even . . . see the CEO. So that is a 
problem.''
  In my view, this is a real problem because, if we are attacked, the 
first strike will likely not be a physical one against the military but 
a cyber strike against the infrastructure of movement, logistics, and 
other critical assets in the civilian space.
  With growing cyber threats, we all need to be more proactive in 
ensuring our Nation's cybersecurity before there are additional serious 
breaches. This legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by 
encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their 
investors and customers on whether and how their boards of directors 
and senior management are prioritizing cybersecurity.
  I thank the bill's supporters, including the North American 
Securities Administrators Association, the Council of Institutional 
Investors, the National Association of State Treasurers, the California 
Public Employees' Retirement System, the Bipartisan Policy Center, MIT 
Professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law Professor Jack Coffee, Harvard

announced that I would introduce legislation if the tax extenders 
weren't included in the legislation that we passed at that time that 
would keep government open.
  Today I am following through on that promise with a bill that I am 
introducing with Finance Committee ranking member Senator Wyden of 
Oregon.
  It is fitting that I am taking this step in the same month as 
Groundhog Day, as the subject of my remarks is something that Congress 
has had to deal with too many times already.
  Next to me is a depiction from the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' which is 
about a man named Phil who must relive the same day over and over until 
he gets everything right. While we still need to break the cycle of 
repetitive short-term extensions, the right thing to do right now is to 
extend these already-expired provisions for 2018 and 2019.
  As I have said before, the tax extenders are a collection of 
temporary tax


incentives that have required extension on a very regular basis in 
order to keep them available to the taxpayers. Currently, there are 26 
provisions. At one time there were as many as 50-some. We have done 
away with some of them and made some of those laws permanent, but these 
26 provisions expired at the end of 2017. They need to be extended, as 
well as three others that expired at the end of last year.
  Today we are in the middle of filing season for 2018 tax returns, and 
taxpayers affected by these expired provisions need a resolution so 
that they can file. I want to stress that I want to find a long-term 
resolution so that we don't have to have temporary tax policy, but it 
is critical we make it clear to the taxpayers that these provisions are 
available for the 2018 filing season and extending them for this year 
will give us room to take a needed long-term view of this temporary tax 
policy.
  Many of the tax extenders are intended to be incentives, and to be 
successful, then, these incentives need to be in effect before 
decisions can be made. That is why we should provide extensions for at 
least 2 years, to maximize that incentive effect. But it is also 
important that we extend these provisions for 2018, even though the 
year has obviously already ended. We have developed a very bad policy 
and a very bad habit of extending these tax provisions year after year, 
and people and businesses have come to expect that the extension will 
happen.
  As a result, decisions were made by various businesses in 2018 based 
upon the expectation of extension, and that is a reasonable expectation 
because we have done it over decades. In other words, people did what 
we wanted them to do in their business decisions when these provisions 
were created. We should not retroactively punish these businesspeople 
for Congress's inaction.
  Today, a diverse group of organizations, including the National 
Biodiesel Board, the American Trucking Associations, and the National 
Corn Growers Association, among others, sent a letter to congressional 
leaders requesting that the expired provisions be extended through 2019 
as quickly as possible. I want to quote a few sentences from that 
letter:

       Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as 
     it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private 
     sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we 
     respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these 
     expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate 
     legislative vehicle.

  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be 
printed in the Record.",G000386,2019-02-28
611,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1595-2,4,Mr. GRASSLEY,"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, another very important point I want to 
make has to do with the question about whether an extender package 
should be offset or not. Around here, the word ``offset'' means if you 
have tax provisions that might lose revenue, then do you have other 
revenue coming in to take its place? The House has decided that is what 
you should do--pay as you go, or PAYGO, as they might call it. It is a 
rule of the House.
  I have a long record of promoting budget responsibility, and I am as 
concerned about the deficit and debt as anyone. However, we also have 
bipartisan precedent for treating the extension of temporary tax 
policy, like these extenders, just as we treat the extension of annual 
spending policy. In neither case do we need offset for such extensions. 
In other words, it is all right to spend more money or continue to 
spend the same amount of money after a program has expired, and you 
don't have to offset it when you have tax law that has been on the 
books for a couple of decades, and it is sunset. Why should you have to 
sunset that? There are a few people around here who think it is all 
right to spend money without offsets, but it is wrong to do tax policy 
unless you have offsets.
  There are a few specific items in this legislation that I want to 
take time to mention. Significant work has already been done to provide 
long-term solutions on two extenders--the short line railroad tax 
credit and the biodiesel tax credit.
  The bill I am introducing extends those credits at their current 
levels for 2018 and 2019. I want my colleagues to


know that I still remain committed to enacting the compromises that 
several of our colleagues and I worked with the stakeholders to 
achieve.
  The bill also includes an extension of a proposal adopted last 
Congress that would extend the 7.5-percent floor for itemized 
deductions of medical expenses. Without this provision, the floor on 
deductions will be 10 percent for 2019. This means that without this 
provision, individuals with chronic illnesses and high medical expenses 
would have to pay more for healthcare before that excess can be 
deducted in the expenses on their 2019 tax returns.
  This proposal is a very important priority for one of our best 
colleagues, Senator Collins. She deserves a lot of credit for getting 
what has turned into a bipartisan proposal to help many Americans 
facing catastrophic medical expenses.
  Finally, the legislation includes provisions to assist Americans who 
have been affected by natural disasters in 2018. This package includes 
proposals that we have adopted in prior years to help Americans recover 
from natural disasters across our country. For example, the package 
would allow increased access to retirement funds and relax restrictions 
around charitable giving. I am sure everyone here would like to help 
people affected by these natural disasters as soon as we are able to.
  I don't want my comments today to imply that each tax extender should 
be permanently extended, but the right thing to do now is to provide 
extensions for at least 2018 and 2019. In the long term, Congress needs 
to decide if these provisions should be allowed to expire or if they 
should be phased out or if they should be made permanent as current tax 
policy or modified in some way beyond expiring, phasing out, or being 
made permanent.
  Those decisions need to be made after we resolve the short-term 
crisis caused by the current lapse. These provisions have support of 
Members on both sides of the aisle. For people who think that things 
around here get done only with Republicans fighting Democrats or vice 
versa, these provisions have wide bipartisan support.
  There is a solid foundation for a long-term package consisting of 
many of these provisions in one form or another. We need to get past 
today so that we can chart the course for a reliable future for the tax 
extenders and give business some certainty.
  Just as Phil wants to stop living the same day over and over again, I 
think all of us want to break the cycle of short-term extensions of, in 
many cases, very popular tax policy. The legislation I introduce today 
with the ranking member, Senator Wyden of Oregon, is a critical first 
step toward helping taxpayers complete their 2018 returns and helping 
us begin work on a long-term solution to temporary tax policy.
  I have asked our majority leader to rule XIV this bill onto the 
calendar, and I urge the House to send us a tax bill to address the 
extenders without further delay.
  Just this morning, I had discussions with Iowa Congressmen of both 
political parties about this issue to contact the leadership of the 
House and the leadership of the Ways and Means Committee on the 
importance of moving legislation since the Constitution doesn't allow 
the Senate to move tax legislation in the first place.",G000386,2019-02-28
612,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1595-2,5,Mr. CARPER,"  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, during the debate on the nomination of 
Andrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency I came to the floor to express concerns on a number of issues, 
including EPA's regulation of per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl 
substances--PFAS.
  PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals developed in the 1940s. PFAS 
can be found across industries in many products, including food 
packaging, nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam 
used by the military. These chemicals have a long and tragic history--
suffice it to say that their widespread use resulted too many Americans 
without access to safe drinking water.
  This very issue is a matter of some controversy as EPA has failed to 
provide meaningful and swift action on these chemicals under this 
administration. That is why I am here today to introduce a bipartisan 
bill to designate PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the 
Federal superfund law. The Carper-Capito-Peters-Tillis-Stabenow-Rubio-
Merkley-Gardner-Reed-Murkowski-Shaheen-Burr-Bennet-Manchin bill will 
force EPA to begin the rulemaking process to protecting Americans from 
overexposure to these harmful chemicals and hold polluters accountable. 
It is very similar to legislation that has already been introduced in 
the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.
  In his confirmation hearing, Andrew Wheeler said, and I quote:

       It is these Americans that President Trump and his 
     Administration are focused on, Americans without access to 
     safe drinking water or Americans living on or near hazardous 
     sites, often unaware of the health risks they and their 
     families face. Many of these sites have languished for years, 
     even decades. How can these Americans prosper if they cannot 
     live, learn, or work in healthy environments? The answer is 
     simple. They cannot. President Trump understands this and 
     that is why he is focused on putting Americans first.

  One would think those words might mean that there could be some 
common ground at least on addressing PFAS. After all, who wouldn't 
agree that we should be acting with urgency to address contamination 
from these hazardous chemicals?
  According to one 2017 study, drinking water supplies for 6 million 
U.S. residents have exceeded the EPA's lifetime health advisory for 
these chemicals.
  Another 2018 study performed by the Environmental Working Group 
reports that up to 110 million Americans could have PFAS-contaminated 
water.
  In 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was assessing 
the risk of groundwater contamination from firefighting foam at dozens 
of fire and crash testing sites across the country. It is likely that 
they are all contaminated.
  Just last year, the town of Blades in my home State of Delaware 
alerted its 1,250 residents, as well as businesses and schools that use 
public water, to stop using public water for drinking an cooking 
because PFAS chemicals were present at nearly twice the Federal health 
advisory level. Reportedly, 36 of 67 sampled groundwater wells on Dover 
Air Force Base showed dangerously high levels of PFOA and PFOS. And it 
is not just Delaware--contamination is widespread, in red States and 
blue States, in small water systems and large ones, on military sites 
and in residential areas, from Maine to Alaska.
  It is essential that we legislate to require EPA to designate PFOA 
and PFOS as ``hazardous substances,'' which means that polluters could 
be held responsible for cleaning it up under the superfund law. In its 
recently released PFAS Action Plan, EPA has said again that it would 
issue this proposal in the future but did not indicate how long it will 
take to complete. Unfortunately, it has no sense of urgency to address 
these emerging contaminants and to protect American's from harmful 
levels of contamination.
  EPA had an opportunity to take action to address PFAS chemicals in a 
real and comprehensive way; however, time and again, it has failed to 
move in an expeditious and meaningful way. That is why this bill is so 
important. Designating these chemicals as hazardous substances will, at 
a minimum, start the process to getting these contaminated sites 
cleaned up. This not the silver bullet to the broader contamination 
problems, but it is a start.",C000174,2019-02-28
613,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1595-2,6,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am joined this morning by a group of my 
Democratic colleagues to talk about the greatest threat facing our 
country and our planet--climate change. Despite the gravity and scale 
of the problem, at no time in the past 5 years have Republicans brought 
even a single bill to the floor to meaningfully address climate change. 
They brought CRAs to the floor to repeal critical environmental 
protections that limited the emission of greenhouse gases like methane. 
They brought legislation to open up more Federal lands to oil drilling, 
but they haven't brought forward a single meaningful bill to address 
climate change.
  Ironically, the first bill Leader McConnell would bring to the floor 
on climate change is a bill that he and his party intend to vote 
against. What a ridiculous sham; what a pathetic political stunt. It 
would be a stunt on its own from a leader who just a month ago claimed 
he didn't bring sham bills to the floor, but it is an even greater 
stunt because they have nothing positive to say about dealing with this 
climate crisis.
  So today, Democrats will be introducing a resolution to steer the 
direction of this conversation about climate change back in the right 
direction--all 47 Democrats, every single one.
  We are introducing a resolution that affirms three simple things: 
First, climate change is real; second, climate change is changed by 
human activity; and third, Congress must act immediately to address 
this problem. These are three simple things--three things that the vast 
majority of the American people agree with. Two are plain facts, and 
the third is just a statement that Congress should take action in light 
of those two facts.
  Our resolution does not prescribe what action we should take. It 
doesn't say that someone has to be for this solution or that solution. 
It simply states that climate change is happening, and we ought to do 
something about it. It is like saying that opioid abuse is a problem, 
and we should do something. Surely every Senator agrees with that.
  In an ideal world, every single Republican Senator would sign on to 
our climate change resolution because there should be nothing 
controversial about it at all. But because one political party in 
America largely denies the science or, as I am sure my colleague from 
Rhode Island will address, is so in the pocket of Big Oil that it 
refuses to admit the severity of it, I suspect many of our Republican 
colleagues will not sign on, and what a shame--what a shame--that would 
be. At least the American people will know which of their Senators 
denies the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community.
  So if and when Leader McConnell moves to proceed to the Green New 
Deal, Democrats will demand a vote on our resolution, and we will see 
if Leader McConnell is so eager to take that vote.
  Again, I have asked him every day; I asked him earlier this morning: 
Leader McConnell, do you believe climate change is real? Leader 
McConnell, do you believe it is caused by human activity? And, Leader 
McConnell, do you believe Congress has to act to deal with climate 
change? We have simply heard silence from the leader and from just 
about every other Republican so far.
  So we are going to push this resolution, and we hope the American 
people will let their Senators who are not on this resolution know that 
they should be on it. It is the first step to moving something in a 
positive direction because we intend to go on offense on climate.",S000148,2019-02-28
614,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1595-2,7,Mr. UDALL,"  Mr. UDALL. Thank you for the recognition, Madam President.
  Today I rise to call on this body to defend the Constitution, to 
protect the separation of powers, and to safeguard Congress's role as a 
coequal branch of government.
  Today I am introducing a bipartisan resolution with my Senate 
colleagues to terminate the President's declaration of a national 
emergency to build his border wall.
  My partners in this effort include Senator Collins, who is with me 
today. She will be here momentarily. Also partners are Senator 
Murkowski and Senator Shaheen.
  I just want to say to Senator Collins that I commend her on her 
principled stance and on standing up for the Constitution.
  The vote we will take on this resolution is historic. This is no 
longer about the President's wall. This is not about party. This is not 
about protecting the very heart of our American system. This is about 
protecting the very heart of our American system of governance.
  Congress--and only Congress--holds the power of the purse. Article I, 
section 9 of the Constitution clearly states: ``No Money shall be drawn 
from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' 
The Constitution is absolutely clear.
  Congress's power to make spending decisions is very clear. There is 
no ambiguity. Deciding how to spend public funds is among our most 
fundamental powers and responsibilities under the Constitution. The 
Founders gave this power to the legislative body, not the executive, to 
ensure there is a broad support for how public funds are spent.
  Consequential and far-reaching decisions about spending taxpayer 
money are not left to one person, not even the President.
  This body has rejected the President's request to give him $5.7 
billion for his wall along the southern border with Mexico. On February 
14, not 2 weeks ago, we passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2019 by a vote of 83 to 16. That compromise bill did not include the 
$5.7 billion the President wanted to build his wall.
  Whether you believe Congress should fund the President's wall is not 
at issue. This is a question about the strength of the rule of law in 
this country and about the separation of powers, which forms the 
foundation of our American government.
  The President's declaration of a national emergency is an end-run 
around Congress's power to appropriate--plain and simple. To quote 
Senator Collins, the President is ``usurping congressional authority.''
  We are the representatives of the people. The people do not want to 
spend $5.7 billion on the President's wall, and we must protect their 
will.
  Let's be clear. This emergency declaration has serious implications 
for States all across the country. To build this wall, the White House 
will raid $3.6 billion from the Department of Defense's military 
construction budget and $2.5 billion from that Department's drug 
interdiction program, but the White House apparently failed to realize 
there are only about $80 million in the drug interdiction account. So 
we should be prepared for a raid on other accounts or taking even more 
from military construction funding.
  These are military construction funds that Congress already has 
appropriated for specific projects necessary to support the national 
security priorities of the United States. I am privileged to serve on 
the Appropriations Committee. I understand the hard and careful work 
that goes into these funding decisions.
  From my home State of New Mexico, Congress allocated some $85 million 
to construct a formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base in the 
south-central part of New Mexico for unmanned aerial vehicles. This 
investment in technology tracks terrorists


and protects our national security. We allocated $40 million to the 
White Sands Missile Range to build an information systems facility 
badly needed for next-generation research and development activities at 
the range. Both of these projects were vetted over several years and 
deemed important to our national security.
  New Mexico is not alone. Many States' military bases and regional 
economies will be impacted. Colorado, for example, is at risk of losing 
almost $100 million for construction projects at Fort Carson near 
Colorado Springs. Ohio risks $61 million for the first installment for 
building at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center at Wright-
Patterson Air Force Base.
  Military construction projects totaling $210 million are at risk in 
Florida, $520 million in Texas, $81 million in Utah, and the list goes 
on and on. Projects in every corner of the country will be impacted.
  According to the 1976 Senate report from the National Emergencies 
Act, the President's emergency power may ``be utilized only when actual 
emergencies exist.'' As a border Senator, I am here to tell you that 
there is no actual national security emergency at our southern border 
necessitating a massive wall along the southern border, as this body 
has already determined. This is a matter where the President and 
Congress have disagreed and the President is trying to overrule 
Congress by fiat.
  A bipartisan group of 58 former national security officials are 
sounding the alarm. They write: ``Under no plausible assessment of the 
evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the 
president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a 
wall at the southern border.''
  The evidence speaks for itself. The number of border apprehensions 
has decreased dramatically. Since the early 2000s, southern border 
apprehensions have dropped 81 percent. The number of apprehensions at 
the end of fiscal year 2017 was the lowest it has been since 1971--a 
46-year low. We have the lowest number of undocumented immigrants in 
our country that we have had in over a decade.
  The Pew Research Center estimated recently that the total number of 
undocumented immigrants residing in the United States is far less than 
since 2004. That is a 14-year low. And more people emigrate to Mexico 
from the United States than immigrate from Mexico to here. That is 
right. We have a negative net migration rate with Mexico.
  I am one of the four States that border Mexico--one of the four 
States that will be the most directly affected by a wall. I know for an 
absolute fact that there is no national security emergency along my 
State's border with Mexico. It is quite the opposite.
  New Mexico's border communities are thriving. International commerce 
is thriving. Our multicultural communities are thriving. Crime rates 
are low.
  A wall like the President wants would be disastrous for a State like 
New Mexico. It will seize away private property and carve up family 
ranches, farms, and homesteads. It will harm the beautiful but fragile 
environment there on the border.
  Again, whether you support the President's wall is not at issue on 
this vote. As Senator Tillis put it in an op-ed in the Washington Post, 
``I support President Trump's vision on border security. But I would 
vote against the emergency.''
  Another Senate Republican Senator recently said, ``Congress has been 
ceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades. We 
should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking power back.''
  Over 20 former Republican Senators and Representatives were compelled 
to pen a letter opposing the emergency declaration. They state: ``It 
has always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how 
strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to 
presidents and party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional 
republic we must act within the borders of the Constitution.''
  The time to act is now. Litigation has been filed, but Congress 
should resolve the issue of our own constitutional authority and not 
wait for the courts.
  Let me repeat. The vote we will take will be historic. It is 
imperative that all of us--Republican and Democrat--protect and defend 
our Constitution and that we protect and defend the checks and balances 
that unequivocally place the power of the purse with Congress and that 
we affirm our powers--powers that are separate from the President's.
  Our oath is to uphold the Constitution, and the Constitution is 
clear. The Constitution does not empower the President to raid money by 
decree just because Congress has already said no.
  I will vote to terminate the President's declaration of the national 
emergency to build his wall, and I will urge everyone in this Chamber 
to protect our constitutional prerogative and to do so as well.",U000039,2019-02-28
615,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1595-2,8,Ms. COLLINS,"  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the resolution 
that I am joining Senator Udall in introducing. It would reverse the 
President's ill-advised decision to declare a national emergency and 
commandeer funding provided for other purposes by Congress and instead 
redirect it to construct a wall on our southern border.
  I thank Senator Udall for his leadership and also recognize the 
support we have received from our cosponsors, Senator Murkowski and 
Senator Shaheen.
  Let me be clear. The question before us is not whether to support or 
oppose the wall. It is not whether to support or oppose President 
Trump. Rather, it is this: Do we want the executive branch now or in 
the future to hold a power that the Founders deliberately entrusted to 
Congress?
  It has been said that Congress's most precious power is the power of 
the purse set out in plain language in article I, section 9 of our 
Constitution. It reads as follows: ``No money shall be drawn from the 
Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law.''
  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 72, made clear the Founders' view 
that only the legislative branch commands this power, not the judiciary 
and not the executive. James Madison, in Federalist 58, called the 
power of the purse ``the most complete and effectual weapon with which 
any constitution can arm the [ . . . ] representatives of the people.''
  Congress's power was jealously guarded in the early days of our 
Republic. No less an authority on our constitutional framework than 
Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, in his famous ``Commentaries,'' 
explained that ``[i]f it were otherwise, the executive would possess an 
unbounded power over the public purse of the nation, and might apply 
all its monied resources at his pleasure.''
  Throughout our history, the courts have consistently held that ``only 
Congress is empowered by the Constitution to adopt laws directing 
monies to be spent from the U.S. treasury.''
  I strongly support protecting the institutional prerogatives of the 
U.S. Senate and the system of checks and balances that is central to 
the structure of our government.
  I support funding for better border security, including physical 
barriers where they make sense. I understand the President is 
disappointed that the funding he requested did not pass, but the 
failure of Congress to pass funding in the amount the President prefers 
cannot become an excuse for the President to usurp the powers of the 
legislative branch.
  This is not the first time I have made this argument against 
Executive overreach. In 2015, I authored the Immigration Rule of Law 
Act, legislation that would have provided a statutory basis for the 
Dreamer population, while rolling back President Obama's 2014 Executive 
orders expanding that program.
  As I explained at the time, even though I supported comprehensive 
immigration reform and was disappointed that it had not passed, I 
rejected the notion that its failure could serve as the justification 
for President Obama to implement by Executive fiat that which Congress 
had refused to pass, regardless of the wisdom of Congress's decision.
  I would now like to turn to a discussion of the National Emergencies 
Act. This act was passed in 1976 to standardize the process by which 
the President can invoke national emergency powers and Congress can 
terminate the declaration through a joint resolution such as the one we 
are introducing today.


  The act is procedural in nature. It lays out the process the 
President must follow to declare a national emergency but does not 
provide the President with any additional powers. Instead, it requires 
the President to specify where, in existing law, he has been granted 
the authority for the powers he intends to exercise.
  By itself, the National Emergencies Act does not give the President 
the power to repurpose billions of dollars to build a wall. The 
President must look elsewhere for that authority.
  In his declaration, the President cites the authority provided by 
title 10, section 2808 of the U.S. Code, which relates to 
``Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or 
national emergency.'' But that authorization applies only to ``military 
construction projects'' that are ``necessary to support [the] use of 
the armed forces.'' I do not believe this provision can be fairly read 
to bootstrap the presence of troops along the southern border into the 
authority to build a wall as a military construction project.
  The question isn't whether the President can act in an emergency but 
whether he can do so in a manner that would undermine the congressional 
power of the purse.
  Here, I think we need a better understanding of what should qualify 
as an emergency. One place we could turn is to a five-part test 
originally developed by the Office of Management and Budget in 1991, 
under former President George Herbert Walker Bush, to determine whether 
requested funding merited an ``emergency spending'' designation under 
our budget rules.
  Under that test, a spending request was designated as an 
``emergency'' only if all five of the following conditions were met:
  First, expenditures had to be necessary; second, the need had to be 
sudden, coming into being quickly, not building up over time; third, 
the need had to be urgent; fourth, the need had to be unforeseen; and 
fifth, the need could not be permanent.
  I raise this test only by way of analogy, but it is fair to say that 
whether or not you agree with the President that more should be done to 
secure the southern border--and I do agree with the President's goal--
his decision to fund a border wall through a national emergency 
declaration would not pass this five-part test.
  The President's declaration also has practical implications for the 
military construction appropriations process, as my colleague has 
pointed out.
  Last year, in testimony before the Appropriations Committee, the 
Department of Defense said that the President's budget request for 
military construction funding was crucial to support our national 
defense, including construction projects to improve military readiness 
and increase the lethality of the force. This includes missile defense, 
improved facilities in Europe to deter Russian aggression, and 
infrastructure to operationalize the F-35 stealth fighter.
  This also included several important efforts at the Portsmouth Naval 
Shipyard in Maine that are vital to the Navy conducting timely 
maintenance and refueling of our Nation's submarines. Shifting funding 
away from these vital projects is shortsighted and could have very real 
national security implications.
  We must defend Congress's institutional powers, as the Founders hoped 
we would, even when doing so is inconvenient or goes against the 
outcome we might prefer.
  The gridlock we have experienced on difficult issues like border 
security and immigration reform is not simply a failure to get our work 
done but a reflection of the fact that we have yet to reach a 
consensus.
  The President's emergency declaration is ill-advised precisely 
because it attempts to shortcut the process of checks and balances by 
usurping Congress's authority. This resolution blocks that overreach, 
and I hope, regardless of our colleague's position on the construction 
of the border wall, that we will join together to assert Congress's 
constitutional authority in the appropriations process.
  I urge our colleagues to support this important resolution.",C001035,2019-02-28

work to make this monument a reality, the village of Calumet and the 
Italian Hall Memorial Park Committee have ensured that the disaster and 
its victims are forever remembered by the people of Michigan.
  For over 100 years, the area now known as Calumet was the heart of 
Copper Country, attracting thousands of Americans and immigrants from 
around the world, and producing more mineral wealth than the California 
Gold Rush. In response to long work days, low wages, and harsh work 
conditions, the Keweenaw chapters of the Western Federation of Miners 
voted to strike on July 23, 1913. The strike would last nine months--
and though unsuccessful in achieving its goals in the short term, it 
marked a turning point for Copper Country and the rights of the miners 
that called it home.
  On Christmas Eve, 1913, hundreds of striking miners and their 
families gathered to celebrate the holiday on the second floor of 
Calumet's Italian Hall. However, a panic broke out after someone 
falsely shouted ``fire'' in the crowded hall. In the ensuing rush to 
escape the building, seventy-three people, including fifty-nine 
children, were killed. One hundred and six years later, the village of 
Calumet dedicated a new four-ton granite monument inscribed with the 
names of those lost in the Italian Hall disaster. The site of the Hall 
now serves as a place for quiet reflection and remembrance of tragedy 
as well as the history of the Upper Peninsula.
  Madam Speaker, the Italian Hall disaster remains fixed in the 
memories of Michiganders more than one hundred years later. On behalf 
of my constituents, I would like to thank the Italian Hall Memorial 
Park Committee and the village of Calumet for their work to ensure that 
the tragedy and the lives lost there are never forgotten.

621,IN MEMORY OF LOU WACKER,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE228-5,0,Mr. GRIFFITH,"  Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of Lou Wacker, who died 
on February 15, 2019, at the age of 84. Mr. Wacker was the celebrated 
football coach for 23 seasons at my alma mater, Emory & Henry College, 
where he compiled an impressive record and shaped the lives of many 
young men. The Richmond Times-Dispatch quoted him as saying on his 
retirement, ``To say that Emory & Henry College and the football 
program have been a big part of my life for 23 years would be an 
understatement; it has been my life.''
  Coach Wacker was a native of Richmond and excelled at football during 
his time at the University of Richmond. Before his tenure at Emory & 
Henry, he was a defensive coordinator at Hampden-Sydney College. His 
arrival at Emory & Henry in 1982 started an incredible run for the 
Wasps. By the time he retired in 2004, his teams had compiled a 164-76 
record, including seventeen consecutive winning seasons, a 37-game 
winning streak from 1991 to 1998, and eleven Old Dominion Athletic 
Conference Championships.
  After retiring, Coach Wacker stayed close to Emory. For his great 
success, he received many honors, including induction into the Emory & 
Henry College Hall of Fame and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. The 
home grandstand at Emory & Henry's football stadium also bears his 
name. The many players and assistants he mentored over the years will 
remember him for his skill as a coach and for the impact he had on 
them.


  Coach Wacker's survivors include his children Bruce, Kristen, and 
Louis, and his grandchildren Anna Whitehead, Adele Kraus, and Robin 
Kraus. I offer my condolences to them on their loss.

generosity of one of my constituents, High Springs firefighter Doug 
Hope.
  Last week, Doug responded to a Life Alert emergency call for an 
elderly woman who lives alone.
  Thankfully, the alert was a false alarm, but while assessing the 
woman, Doug noticed that her microwave wasn't working, so she was 
unable to heat up the Meals on Wheels food that she relies on to get 
by. When he realized how long it had been since she had eaten a warm 
meal, Doug decided to go out and buy her a new microwave.
  The High Springs Fire Department shared the story on Facebook, and it 
has since been viewed by more than a million people.
  Despite this attention, Doug has remained humble. He says he just 
hopes people who hear about this story are inspired to pay attention to 
one another and do something for someone else.
  Well done, Doug. Your compassion and selflessness are an inspiration 
to all. And, Doug, thanks for being a great example of passing it 
forward.

627,OPIOID CRISIS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1585-2,0,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services and Related Agencies 
held a hearing on the opioid epidemic and how States are responding to 
the crisis. I was pleased Beth Tanzman, the executive director of 
Vermont's Blueprint for Health, agreed to be a witness at today's 
hearing to share the innovative approaches Vermont has taken to combat 
opioid use disorders. Ms. Tanzman has also served as Vermont's deputy 
commissioner for mental health and also directed adult mental health 
services for Vermont's Department of Mental Health.
  While certainly not spared from the opioid epidemic, Vermont is ahead 
of much of the country in many ways: Our State openly identified the 
problem, and our former Governor, Peter Shumlin, dedicated his entire 
State of the State address in 2014 to constructively seek ways to not 
just help addicts get clean, but to halt this scourge in its tracks. 
Public health leaders, addiction specialists, doctors, and State 
leaders came together and implemented a system to integrate substance 
abuse treatment with primary healthcare.
  Ms. Tanzman's testimony focused on the system developed through this 
collaboration, known as the Hub and Spoke Model. The plan helps support 
those in recovery with nine regional


hubs, offering daily medication assisted treatment for those with 
complex addictions, and spokes, where patients receive follow-up care, 
counseling, and general wellness services. This framework has allowed 
Vermont to virtually eliminate wait times for treatment, which can be 
enormous barriers for individuals needing help.
  Every State in the Nation has seen the impacts of opioid abuse. Ms. 
Tanzman's testimony was informative and offers an important perspective 
for other States struggling with treating addiction. I ask unanimous 
consent to that her testimony from the Appropriations Committee hearing 
this morning be printed in the Record.",L000174,2019-02-28

Dorothy Young Gibson, a revered member of the Dallas, Texas, community, 
who will celebrate her 100th birthday on this upcoming March 26th.
  Mrs. Gibson was raised in Rockwall, Texas, home of the Caddo Indians. 
Heavy racial and residential segregation in the area prompted a move to 
Dallas, Texas in 1936, for Mrs. Gibson and her family. She attended 
Burnett High School, an all-African-American school in Terrell, Texas, 
and graduated with honors.
  Mrs. Gibson later became a Vocational Nurse at the Methodist Hospital 
of Dallas, where she served for an impressive 23 years. She has also 
been heavily involved in community engagement and social activism 
throughout her life, specifically work to improve the South Dallas/Fair 
Park area. Mrs. Gibson has donated countless hours of her time to 
volunteer with the Warren Avenue Christian Church and Dallas ISD's 
Reading is Fundamental Program, among others.
  Mrs. Gibson married T.D. Gibson, Sr. on August 19, 1943, and had four 
children: Marilyn, T.D. Jr., Michael, and Charmin. She is now the 
affectionate matriarch of 11 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
  Madam Speaker, I wish to commend Mrs. Inez Dorothy Young Gibson for a 
life dedicated to her family, friends and the Dallas community, and 
want to wish her a very happy 100th birthday. Congratulations are in 
order as she celebrates this extraordinary milestone.

to celebrate Rita Smith-Wade-El, a leader in my community of Lancaster. 
Rita passed away last month, but her impact will be felt in our 
community forever.
  She was a fierce leader on social justice issues and racial equality 
in our community. Her life can best be described as a life of service 
and a life of compassion. She served as a lector, eucharistic minister, 
and social justice


committee member. She was always trying to lighten the load for others 
and lend a helping hand.
  Rita saw those in need and recognized that if she had the power to 
give, she would, and even if it wasn't in her power, she would try 
anyway.
  Rita was a longtime Millersville University professor of psychology 
and African American studies and founded the school's African American 
studies minor.
  I am very happy to celebrate her life today. We will miss her in our 
community, and we will miss her contributions to our community.

Chief Lyn Woolford of the Ashland, Missouri, Police Department for 
being voted America's Favorite Crossing Guard.
  Chief Woolford was recently selected the winner of a contest 
sponsored by Safe Kids Worldwide, a nonprofit organization that works 
on behalf of families and communities to keep children safe from 
injuries. As a result of this competition, the Ashland School District 
will receive $10,000 to improve pedestrian safety.
  Chief Woolford can be seen every schoolday guarding intersections 
near Ashland's schools to make sure that children get across the road 
safely, and the children--many of whom, along with their parents, voted 
for him online--love him.
  It is not unusual to see Chief Woolford wearing colorful hats and 
outfits as he guides the children safely across the road. It might be a 
bright chicken hat or a multicolored parrot hat. No matter the hat, the 
mission is the same: to brighten the children's day and to see that 
they get to school safely.
  Through his actions, the children have a community role model and a 
beloved friend in their local police department. Ashland Police Chief 
Lyn Woolford epitomizes the service of our law enforcement officials 
and deserves our thanks and appreciation.
  Congratulations, Chief Woolford. You truly are making a difference.

635,CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF BETTIE MAE FIKES,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE229-3,0,Ms. SEWELL of Alabama,"  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
extraordinary life of Ms. Bettie Mae Fikes, the ''Voice of Selma.''
  At the age of 16, Ms. Fikes was one of the singers of the Civil 
Rights Movement and a member of the Students Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee (SNCC), which was the only national civil rights organization 
led by young people during the Movement. Ms. Fikes bravely led marches 
with songs, registered voters, boycotted buses, sat in at lunch-
counters and led walkouts at R.B. Hudson High School to support the 
desegregation of the school.
  From an early age, Ms. Fikes began singing with her parents, both of 
whom were from families of gospel singers and preachers. Ms. Fikes was 
exposed to classic hymns and songs and was encouraged to use her voice 
to sing with her parents. At the tender age of four, Ms. Fikes had her 
first big performance: her first church solo. With that success, she 
began to travel throughout the country with her parents' groups, the SB 
Gospel Singers and the Pilgrim Four. However, when Ms. Fikes's mother 
passed away when she was 10 years old, she moved around from Michigan, 
California, and finally to Selma, Alabama.
  Ms. Fikes continued to be involved in singing in the church when she 
moved to Selma. She used every opportunity she could to let her voice 
be heard. It is no surprise, given her background that she proved to be 
an emerging music leader when she joined SNCC at age 16. The more she 
became involved with SNCC, the more it became apparent that she would 
go to jail.
  The foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement prepared themselves 
for the eventuality that they would be arrested. If an officer 
announced that they were under arrest, they knew to fall to their knees 
and to force the officers to carry them to the bus. However, when the 
time came, Ms. Fikes and her friend Evelyn Manns realized the police 
were using cattle prods on the young men and women. Hoping to avoid 
this pain, both women stood up and loaded the bus to go to jail.
  Ms. Fikes bounced between the county and city jail, Camp Selma and 
Camp Camden. She was brought before Judge Reynolds where she was 
repeatedly asked who organized the march. Judge Reynolds and others 
hoped that the students would implicate Martin Luther King, Jr. in 
hopes of building a case against Dr. King for contributing to the 
delinquency of minors. Instead, Ms. Fikes loudly declared: ``Jesus lead 
me, and my mama feed me.'' This frustrated the judge and led to Ms. 
Fikes being jailed for nearly three weeks.
  Instead of being defeated, Ms. Fikes used this time to organize other 
young people who were also sent to jail.
  ``I had been there so long I felt like a trustee there,'' she once 
said. With this new Trustee status and the assistance of Reverend F.D. 
Reese of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in Selma, Ms. Fikes was 
able to help others.
  Ms. Fikes also bore witness to Bloody Sunday. That morning Ms. Fikes 
was a messenger, carrying messages from Brown Chapel AME to the head of 
the line at the base of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. She described the 
experience later, saying, ''You know how it feels just before a storm--
there was nobody walking on the streets . . . it was such a stillness 
that you can't explain.''
  As tensions rose, Ms. Fikes continued delivering messages back and 
forth, when, finally, a half block from the church, she heard the 
rumbling of Bloody Sunday: ``Out of this stillness, this earthquake 
[sound], the ground it just shifted . . . and when I looked up . . . 
people were running everywhere.'' Despite the hate and the violence, 
Ms. Fikes saw the true spirit of the foot soldiers of Selma.
  After her time in Selma, Ms. Fikes went on to become a very 
successful singer who has


graced the stages of Carnegie Hall and the Library of Congress, as well 
as the 2004 Democratic National Convention where she was introduced by 
Maya Angelou. She has had the opportunity to perform with Joe Turner, 
Lightnin' Hopkins, Albert King, James Brown, Bob Dylan, and Mavis 
Staples, among others. She continues to travel throughout the United 
States and Canada to speak about diversity and civil rights, because 
although we have come a long way, there is always work to be done to 
advance justice and equality.
  On a personal note, I grew up in Selma hearing the voice of Bettie 
Mae Fikes. Her beautiful voice was the soundtrack of the historic march 
from Selma to Montgomery. I am so grateful that she faithfully returns 
on the pilgrimage to Selma each year with Congressman John Lewis and 
the Faith and Politics Institute to commemorate Bloody Sunday. Her 
beautiful music continues to move us all as we rededicate ourselves to 
the ideals of equality and justice for all. I know that I would not be 
Alabama's first black Congresswoman today had it not been for the 
bravery and sacrifice of freedom fighters like Bettie Mae Fikes.
  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 7th Congressional District and the 
State of Alabama, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 
activism and lasting contributions of Ms. Bettie Mae Fikes. Through 
song, her melodious voice was an inspiration for the Civil Rights 
Movement that changed a nation. Her work as an educator, her incredible 
voice and her story will be remembered in Alabama for many years to 
come.

636,ENDANGERING AMERICANS WITH GUN CONTROL,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2295-4,0,Mr. LaMALFA,"  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, this week the new Democrat majority has 
endangered more Americans with its push for more and more gun control.
  By definition, criminals don't follow the law. Criminals don't honor 
gun laws. They steal. They commit murder, all sorts of crimes without 
permission. They don't seek permission when they take something from 
you, when they enter your home.
  They don't seek permission to become gun owners. Yet, what happens 
here in the legislation this week, limits the rights, limits the 
ability for people to defend themselves, defend their own homes, defend 
their own families, by having less options or less ability to get a 
weapon if they need it, especially timely.
  These measures do not work. They do not work to stop the shootings 
that are often cited as the reason to deny people their Second 
Amendment rights in this country.
  Indeed, it is a political agenda that gets pushed in every election, 
every possible time in legislation, and finally, with the majority they 
have, they are able to push this stuff through and harm innocent 
Americans and their ability to defend themselves.
  This has to come to a stop. I hope the Senate will defeat this 
measure.

Great Falls who founded and leads My Neighbor in Need, a nonprofit 
organization that helps provide resources to people in need.
   With the help of computer programmer Tom Penwell, Dave created 
myneighborinneed.org, a platform for people to anonymously request 
help. The organization evaluates a request and lists it on their 
website where members of the community can volunteer to meet the need.
   My Neighbor in Need relies on the generosity of neighbors to fulfill 
essential needs, including winter clothes, beds, furniture, car and 
home repairs, help with utility bills, and transit passes or bicycles 
for people to get to and from work. The organization, which celebrates 
its seventh anniversary on March 20, has helped fulfill nearly 13,000 
individual requests for help.
   My Neighbor in Need has grown from a one-man operation to a 
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization operating in Montana and nine cities 
in Wisconsin.
   In 2013, Dave launched a similar concept to meet the needs of 
Montana students. My Student in Need now operates in over 160 schools 
throughout Montana and has helped fulfill over 2,800 requests from

   The appalling massacre perpetrated on the innocent people of Khojaly 
in February 1992 is no less shocking 27 years later. One of the worst 
atrocities ever committed in the South Caucasus, justice has still not 
been delivered and 150 civilians are still missing.
   As we demand respect for human rights and democratic accountability 
within the international community, it is important that we continue to 
remember what happened in Khojaly and bring those responsible to 
account.

649,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1590-2,0,Mr. CARDIN," Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 
service and achievements of Ms. Chris Correale, director of harbor 
development for the Maryland Port Administration, upon her retirement.
  Chris Correale is the ultimate example of a public servant whose 
expertise and efforts while unknown to the majority of Maryland's 
residents, have been critical to Maryland's economy and environment.
  An expert in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers processes, Chris has spent 
more than 25 years crafting and implementing innovative and 
collaborative Federal and State beneficial reuse projects that kept the 
Port of Baltimore's shipping channels open and improved the environment 
in the Chesapeake Bay. From dredging, construction, beach 
replenishment, habitat restoration, and permitting, Chris has been the 
visionary behind the development of projects that have significantly 
improved the infrastructure, environment, business climate, regional 
partnerships, and economic development opportunities throughout the 
State of Maryland.
  At the Maryland Port Administration, Chris ensured the Port of 
Baltimore's channels are in top condition for maritime traffic serving 
the port. She oversaw the planning and policy of what to do with the 
dredged material, she secured State and Federal funding for the port, 
and she coordinated multi-agency management of the port's aids to 
navigation systems.
  Prior to joining the Maryland Port Administration, Chris had a 
distinguished career as the chief of the operations division of the 
U.S. Army Corps' Baltimore District. By overseeing the Baltimore 
District's navigation program, Chris was instrumental in the 
operations, maintenance, protection, and restoration of Maryland's 
ports, military installations, levees, Federal channels, island 
habitats, and reservoirs.
  Chris's retirement is a loss for the State of Maryland. Her vision, 
expertise, and extraordinary social skills have enabled her to 
successfully navigate the Federal, State, and local forces to bring so 
many critical projects to fruition. She has significantly improved the 
infrastructure, environment, and business climate throughout the State 
of Maryland, and she will be missed. Therefore, it is my honor to 
recognize the contributions of Ms. Chris Correale to the State of 
Maryland and thank her for her years of valuable service.

652,PASSING OF MRS. FANNIE MAE EVANS CORBETT AND IN RECOGNITION OF HER MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE231-4,0,Mr. BUTTERFIELD,"  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of a great woman and 
legend within the Wilson, North Carolina community, Mrs. Fannie Mae 
Evans Corbett. Mrs. Corbett passed away on Tuesday, February 19, 2019. 
She was 86 years old.
  Born in Pitt County, North Carolina on May 23, 1932, Mrs. Corbett was 
the fourth of five children born to Bessie Evans and Sylvester Powell. 
Mrs. Corbett learned the meaning of hard work at a young age, spending 
much of her developmental years working in the cotton and tobacco 
fields. In 1955, Mrs. Corbett moved to Wilson, North Carolina, where 
she married and raised her family. After becoming a single mother of 
four children, Mrs. Corbett set out to improve her economic outlook by 
returning to school to earn her high school diploma and an associate's 
degree from Wilson Community Technical Institute.
  Mrs. Corbett's influence in Wilson was transformational. In 1968, 
Mrs. Corbett became one of the key founders of the Wilson Community 
Improvement Association (WCIA). Mrs. Corbett led WCIA's growth from a 
local grassroots organization to a proactive movement that was a model 
for community development corporations across the country. Mrs. 
Corbett's indelible contributions to Wilson include coordinating voter 
registration drives across East Wilson and engaging the youth in 
educational and recreational programs. In 1973, under Mrs. Corbett's 
leadership, WCIA established the Wilson Senior Citizen Center, which 
was the first nutritional feeding program in Wilson County.
  While championing the value of homeownership, Mrs. Corbett advocated 
for programs that would make owning a home an attainable goal even to 
those with modest means. In 1991, WCIA received a $1.2 million grant 
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build 68 
homes for low- and moderate-income people. Over 200 families applied 
for residency in the subdivision, Adventura East. After purchasing more 
land, WCIA completed an additional 30 units. Today, the Adventura East 
I & II subdivision is home to 148 families. In 1993, with WCIA's 
affordable housing momentum building, the organization acquired Sunset 
Terrace, a 104-unit housing complex. Two years later, WCIA


successfully purchased and restored Beacon Pointe Apartments in Wilson. 
In 1997, WCIA restored and renovated Mercy Hospital, which was built in 
1913 as one of three African American hospitals in North Carolina.
  Mrs. Corbett's service to her community has received national and 
international recognition and awards, including the prestigious Nancy 
Susan Reynolds award, the Citizen Award for Outstanding Service to 
Citizens of Wilson, and the Pioneering Award for Exemplary Service in 
Community Economic Development. Mrs. Corbett has also been featured in 
several publications and books, including ``To Right These Wrongs'' and 
``Greater Freedom.''
  Mrs. Corbett leaves to cherish her memory, four children, Barbara 
Claudette Blackston of Wilson, North Carolina; Christopher Evans of 
Apex, North Carolina; Donald Ray Evans of Portsmouth, Virginia; and 
Alvin Quintin Corbett of Eastampton, New Jersey; and a host of 
relatives, friends, and loved ones.
  Madam Speaker, as a devoted mother, friend, and public servant, Mrs. 
Fannie Mae Evans Corbett's passing will surely be felt by all whose 
lives she touched. She will forever be missed, but never forgotten in 
the City of Wilson and across the State of North Carolina.

654,IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2295-5,1,Mr. GOHMERT,"  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I do appreciate the Speaker's new policy 
that says a Member of Congress can only have one Special Order in which 
they are in charge of the time each week once a week. I have been 
trying to get Republicans to take our time, much in the way my 
colleague, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the group they call the ``30 
Somethings'' did in 2005 and 2006.
  I have not had a great deal of success in getting a lot of people to 
take Special Order time. But with this new rule and some of the 
terrific freshmen that we have got who have come in--some of the folks 
who have been here a term or two--they are stepping up and taking our 
time to discuss critically important issues for our country. Today, I 
am it from our party, and I am honored to be here.
  We have heard a lot of talk, and the reason we say have heard a lot 
of talk is because there is truth in seeing a double standard at the 
Department of Justice for a number of years now.
  There was a time when it was the Department of Justice that Jeff 
Sessions remembered back in the 1980s during his time as U.S. attorney. 
That time changed with top people in the FBI and top people in the DOJ; 
it became no longer about justice, but just us and what we want at the 
DOJ and the FBI.
  In talking to former Justice attorneys, prosecutors, one dear friend 
in Texas--not in my district, but a very dear friend--we were talking 
about how the things that were done by people, including Rosenstein, 
the former U.S.


attorney, McCabe, Strzok, Page, all of these other people, Ohr, were 
incredible, just incredible, and I would include Mueller in that.
  Mueller as FBI Director, I continue to believe did more damage to the 
FBI during his 12 years as the director of the FBI than anyone, even 
the problems that J. Edgar Hoover created, especially in his later 
years, the wiretapping that he did of people who should not have been 
wiretapped. Of course, he didn't just do it on his own. As I recall, 
Attorney General Kennedy had supported wiretapping of Martin Luther 
King, Jr., if I remember correctly.
  But what we have seen in the unmasking of American citizens who have 
been followed by email, by wire--not taps, but just following their 
conversations as the NSA and our intelligence community is able to do 
these days, is absolutely incredible. Hundreds and hundreds of 
Americans were unmasked. We were assured with the PATRIOT Act when it 
was up for being reauthorized, oh, no, we are so careful to make sure 
that we don't capture Americans that should not be captured unless they 
are involved with a terrorist organization or a known foreign 
terrorist. They don't get picked up.
  But now, if they are talking to a terrorist, a known foreign agent, 
then it is possible they could be picked up, but those names are 
masked. They are never unmasked. That is too big of a burden. And then 
we find out under the Obama administration, the American people have 
had their privacy violated, like Democrats and Republicans alike swore 
to us would not happen. Well, it has happened. And it has continued to 
go on.
  I had hoped that Christopher Wray would clean things up at the FBI, 
but he appears to be more concerned about covering up problems rather 
than cleaning up the problems. I saw a good example of that at the end 
of August when, once again, the intelligence community had made clear 
they sent their investigator, Frank Rucker, over to explain to Peter 
Strzok, as head of the FBI's counterintelligence--and also Dean 
Chappell, their liaison--to explain that we now have 100 percent proof, 
there is no question, Hillary Clinton's private email server was 
hacked.
  They embedded a direction into her server that forced every email 
coming in and going out into what has now been disclosed publicly by 
others as a Chinese intelligence agency front.
  They were getting every one of Hillary Clinton's--over 30,000 emails 
to and from. There were four that were glitches, but otherwise, over 
30,000 emails. So that must include the ones that President Obama sent 
using another name so people wouldn't realize it was him using a 
private server.
  But there were also the President's daily intelligence briefings that 
went through her home. She had somebody at the home print them out for 
her without any security clearance. There were all kinds of violations, 
what appeared from the code to be outright crimes, but the double 
standard appears to continue.
  This is from February 25, an article from CNS News, Terence Jeffrey 
reported that the inspector general says, ``Prosecution Was Declined 
for Senior DOJ Official Who Sexually Assaulted a Subordinate.''
  And it goes on to talk about that. The name is not disclosed. He 
sexually harassed subordinates, sexually assaulted yet another 
subordinate, and then lacked candor. That is the DOJ's explanation for 
people they don't want to prosecute when they are actually saying that 
he lied, committed a crime, but lied when the IG investigated this 
matter.
  So the unnamed prosecutor or prosecutors were not disclosed, but 
allowed to retire, no consequences, though guilty of sexual assault in 
the DOJ.
  Now, there were a lot of things I disagreed on with a late, former 
Federal judge in Texas named William Wayne Justice, but one thing I 
agreed with him on, and I heard him tell people: ``You, of all people, 
especially, knew better.''
  And he would come down harder on somebody like this who had been part 
of the DOJ. I would imagine Judge Justice, if he were around, he would 
throw the book at somebody who worked at Justice and still committed 
crime and abused the system. I can just hear him still today coming 
after somebody like that.
  But not in the DOJ. We have got lots of carryover from the Obama 
years, and I know my friend, Jeff Sessions, called them career people 
because they were in career slots. But he was talking about people who 
loved Sally Yates, thought she did the right thing in refusing to 
defend constitutional positions taken by the Trump administration.
  Yet, many of those people are still there undercutting President 
Trump, undercutting Matt Whitaker when he was acting, and will, no 
doubt, be undercutting Attorney General Barr.


  So this is a real problem when the Justice Department, the one we 
counted on for many decades now, if there was something wrong, whether 
it is civil rights or others, and justice could not be found, the 
Department of Justice could be counted on to come in and pursue real 
justice, to their credit.
  FBI agents and prosecutors, some retired now from the Department of 
Justice, have privately conveyed to me their broken hearts over the 
damage done to the Department of Justice and to the FBI because they 
became so calloused, so self-absorbed, and so political that they have 
damaged not only the FBI and not only the Department of Justice, but 
this country.
  But when you have willing allies in the alt-left media--or some call 
them the mainstream media; certainly, alt-left these days--it is 
understandable that same feeling of desperation is felt by the American 
people: Where do we turn when the Justice Department is not honest?
  It used to be you could trust the media. You could find somebody who 
would do such great investigative journalism that they would get to the 
heart of it and bring something to the forefront, to the point that the 
American people would justifiably become outraged, and that would force 
either elected or appointed Federal officials with the Federal 
Government to do something.
  But here we have alt-left, lamestream media saying that there is no 
crisis on our border. Yet if you look at the same things said by Obama 
officials about the same problems, except now exacerbated on our border 
with all the caravans that have come, are coming, and are continuing to 
be established in Central America, it is amazing how some of these 
media outlets can even continue to call themselves journalists.
  An article from Brian Flood, January 10, this year, points out that: 
``News outlets readily described a `crisis' at the border under then-
President Barack Obama when he sought funding to deal with a surge of 
migrants, many of them women and children. But now that President Trump 
is in the White House, the mainstream media seem far more reluctant to 
use the word.
  ``Back in the summer of 2014, the headlines and stories referring to 
the C-word''--apparently the crisis word--``were plentiful as the 
border surge was taken seriously along the Acela corridor.
  ``The Washington Post''--now an alt-left medium--``wrote in 2014, 
`White House requests $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border 
crisis' ''--there is that C-word, crisis--``while CNN published a 
feature, `Daniel's journey: How thousands of children are creating a 
crisis in America.' It described a problem of `epic proportions.' ''
  Now, they point out that: ``Around the same time, the Huffington Post 
declared that `photos of the humanitarian crisis' ''--even Huffington 
called it a crisis--``along the southern border were `shocking,' and 
ABC News reported that Obama requested `$3.7 billion to cope with the 
humanitarian crisis on the border and the spike in illegal crossings by 
unaccompanied minors from Central America.' ''
  The ABC News story even mentioned this word to deal with plans for 
$3.7 billion. This was ABC's headline: ``Immigration crisis funds.'' 
Incredible.
  NBC, June 2014, Andrea Mitchell said the undocumented children 
flooding the border were, in her words, ``creating a crisis'' for 
authorities.
  How these news outlets can turn around and now say that there is no 
crisis when the testimony and the evidence is clear that the overall 
numbers for last year may have been down, but


as the testimony and evidence makes clear, in October, November, 
December, and January, those numbers spiked to numbers that our Border 
Patrol has not dealt with before for minors and family units.
  Why would they all of a sudden spike during that time? Because it 
appeared the Democrats had a chance of taking the majority here in the 
House, and in so doing, Democrats have made clear they wanted to 
continue to allow illegal immigration. They welcomed the families. 
Naturally, you were going to see a spike.
  These people below our southern border in Mexico, Central America, 
South America, and now coming from the Middle East and other 
continents, have been coming for some time from other countries. They 
are being lured in.
  The head of the Border Patrol testified this week in our committee 
that they were being pulled in. But really, it is being lured. They 
hear: Gee, if we will just come now, we have people who are in charge 
of the House of Representatives who want us there, and they are going 
to try to stop the President from enforcing and securing the border, so 
now is the time to come.
  And they are coming. We heard the testimony that about 80 percent of 
the people who came across our borders in decades past were normally 
male adults. It made sense. Usually, it was people who were coming 
looking for work, and they were going to send money to their families 
back in Mexico. But the word got out the end of last year and this year 
that if you will come and bring a minor child, whether it is your child 
or not, then you have a good chance of staying in the country.
  We know that nobody crosses our border illegally on the south unless 
they have gotten permission by paying the drug cartels. Over and over 
during the nights I have spent on the border, the question has been 
asked: Where did you get the money to pay to come?
  Oh, 1,000 here, 1,000 from people in the U.S.
  Well, what about the rest of the money you have to pay?
  The drug cartels are going to let me work it off when I get where I 
am going.
  They would normally have an address. As I understand it, that is 
often the address the drug cartel told them where they would need to go 
get set up and work off what they owed to the drug cartels.
  But, Madam Speaker, you shouldn't be surprised when you see headlines 
like: Meth lab in major U.S. city busted, run by drug cartels.
  As the Department of Homeland Security folks have pointed out to me 
before, the drug cartels call us their logistics. All they have to do 
is get somebody illegally into the country, and they hand us the 
address of somebody supposedly that they know where they can go live, 
and we handle the shipping for them. We ship them to wherever they want 
to go. Sometimes, they are detained, but we have shipped millions of 
people around, all over the country.

  If what they have told the Border Patrol about working off what they 
owe the drug cartels is true--I haven't seen or heard any reason it 
wouldn't be--then our Homeland Security Department for a decade or so 
has been shipping people to the location where the drug cartels want 
them. The drug cartels are making billions and billions of dollars a 
year.
  When you hear any Mexican or Central American official who says they 
want to keep the American border open, you can just pretty well 
guarantee they are getting money from the drug cartels.
  The best thing, the most caring and loving thing, we could do for our 
neighbors to the south would be to secure our border, put border 
barriers where they need it, whether it is a wall, a 30-foot barrier, 
whatever. Secure the border and then that will cut off the billions of 
dollars of American money going to the drug cartels for them to 
terrorize people in Mexico and people in Central America.
  You care about people south of our border. Of course, we can't bring 
in all those millions who are suffering under drug cartel rule and 
reign, but we could secure our border and cut off the domestic 
terrorists called the drug cartels, cut off their funding so they won't 
be able to pay people to cut off the heads of police chiefs or mayors 
who take a strong stand against the drug cartels and put those heads on 
a pike as an example to anybody who tries to stand up against the 
cartels.
  It used to be that the drug cartels had a deal. It was just kind of a 
policy that they are not going to allow any kind of crime or violence 
to tourists because that is too important for Mexico to have those 
tourists' money coming in. That has long since gone by the way. 
Tourists are killed and terrorized.
  I long for the day when my wife and I can go back to where we 
honeymooned in Mexico, back to where we celebrated anniversaries. It 
was wonderful. We don't believe we can do that now.
  If we secure our border and dry up the money to the drug cartels, 
then the money can begin flowing to Mexico for something besides drugs, 
and we can cut off the fentanyl and the massive amount of drugs that 
pours across our southern border undetected.
  I know some people say the majority of drugs are coming through the 
ports of entry. That is where they catch more of it. But as it was 
explained to me and   Steve Chabot some years back down in Colombia, 
when they were showing us--we had DEA. The British had people who were 
helping. They were doing a great job fighting the FARC's drugs down in 
Colombia under then-President Uribe. They were saying that this guy is 
fearless. It is hard keeping him alive, but he is amazing. He is 
fighting the drug cartels down there.
  I said, well, so you are saying about two-thirds of the cocaine, the 
drugs from Colombia, goes up through the Gulf of Mexico into Mexico, so 
it can cross our southern border. Another one-third apparently goes up 
to California, trying to cross the border, it goes into Mexico across 
our southern border. I mean, if they have boats that will go that far, 
why not just have them pull up to a Texas or California beach that is 
deserted?
  These Colombian, American, and British drug experts explained that it 
is because the drug cartels are businesspeople. They have a business 
model. They have a business plan. They play the odds. They know the 
odds are many times better to get the drugs into America if they don't 
go to a port of entry and they don't go to an abandoned beach 
somewhere. They bring it into Mexico, have it cross the Mexico-U.S. 
border, and they will get most of their drugs in. So that is their 
business plan.


  That is still going on. It was going on during President Bush's 
administration, probably back to Clinton and the former Bush and even 
Reagan, to a lesser extent. But it is sure going on in the 21st 
century.
  With all the discussion about there not being a crisis when clearly 
there has been and is--it is a humanitarian crisis, but it is also a 
crisis of U.S. sovereignty.
  We cannot have a country that is based on laws if we cannot control 
our own borders. We will be overwhelmed, as we have been, by more and 
more people who do not observe the laws, do not think the laws are 
important. They do not understand. They have not been educated how 
important it is to enforce the law fairly across the board. They don't 
know what it is to preserve self-government.
  Franklin knew that, Benjamin Franklin, when he said: ``It is a 
Republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' He knew. He had studied history, 
as had our Founders. They knew that the Constitution that came 
together, as Washington referenced, had to have divine providence at 
work, because no way these guys who started out for 5 weeks doing 
nothing but yelling at each other could have come up with a document 
that was the best governing document, the best constitution, put 
together in the history of mankind.
  Here is more about the media's hypocrisy, an article from the 
Washington Examiner, Eddie Scarry. This has a quote: ``We now have an 
actual humanitarian crisis''--there is that C-word again--``on the 
border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our 
immigration system once and for all.'' That was a quote from then-
President Barack Obama in the Rose Garden in 2014.
  He went on to say--that is, President Obama--``In recent weeks, we've 
seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive


at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and 
traffickers.''
  That is basically, as the Examiner points out, what President Trump 
said. He said: ``Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally 
brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are 
used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.''
  This article says: ``The only difference is how the media are 
covering it.''
  The Washington Post said, 2014--this is The Washington Post's words--
``The current crisis on the Southwest border, where authorities have 
apprehended tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American 
children since October''--well, there you are. There is that C-word 
they used then and belittle the word being used now.
  Anyway, this is an article from The New York Times from 2014 by 
Michael Shear and Jeremy Peters. They said, talking about the border 
crossing into Texas, it is ``an urgent humanitarian situation.''
  Their article said, and this is from Senator Marco Rubio: ``Let's 
remember, this administration''--talking about the Obama 
administration--``went around for years saying the border has never 
been more secure than it is now. I think,'' and this is Marco Rubio, 
``that's been exposed as a fallacy over the last 3 weeks.'' That is 
because people were realizing it was a border crisis during the Obama 
years.
  Just the fact that it has gone on for years and years does not 
diminish the crisis. It actually exacerbates the crisis. When you put 
the October, November, December, January numbers, record numbers, of 
people coming in claiming to be family units--why? Because they have 
heard, if they have minor children, then they will be allowed to stay, 
and they will be allowed to keep the minor children. It is encouraging 
a dark market, a criminal market, in children.
  Make sure, if you are coming to America, you have a child in your 
group, because then you claim: Oh, we can't be separated.
  As the Director of Border Patrol pointed out this week in testimony 
under oath, now the huge majority is people coming who are claiming to 
be family units. Most of them are, but we don't know. That is why it is 
important to check.
  So this is a time of crisis, and you would hope that major media, 
whether it is alt-left or whatever, would be reporting what is 
happening in America. It is a humanitarian crisis, as they acknowledged 
during President Obama's term. It is even more of a humanitarian crisis 
now that there are so many more minor children who are being brought 
here.
  Once again, for those who bring up the term ``war on women,'' how 
about the fact that over a third of the young girls, the young women, 
who are brought to our southern border illegally are being sexual 
assaulted, raped, normally multiple times along the way? Do people not 
care what is happening? Wouldn't that be a war on women that some of us 
want to stop?
  The estimate by doctors who have been treating these people say that 
17 percent of the young boys coming up and crossing into the U.S. 
illegally have been sexually molested, assaulted.
  Where is the outrage? It ought to be from both sides of the aisle.
  These are people whose lives are just being terrorized. When we hear 
about, ``Oh, well, people are just caring about their families,'' 
really? You would subject your daughter to being one of the third who 
is sexually raped numerous times while you want to come into America? 
You would do that to your daughter?
  We ought to be helping Mexico. They are not helping much. They are 
helping some. But we ought to be shoring up the border. It is the best 
thing we can do for Mexico, continue to be the most generous country in 
the world, in the history of the world, in allowing people to come into 
our country legally.
  Keep that going. It is good for America. But stop the drug cartels 
from controlling our southern border. It ought to be our authorities 
controlling our border, nobody else.
  If that is not enough, here comes what has been called a Green New 
Deal. Some have accurately called it more of a green socialist 
manifesto, a green raw deal.

  Rick Manning has a great article this month: ``Everyone is talking 
about the Green New Deal and how it would end domestic airline travel, 
the internal combustion engine, fossil fuel usage, most electricity 
generation, and even ban cow flatulence. You have groups guessing what 
the cost of the Green New Deal would be in terms of dollars on an 
annual basis. . . . To everyone seeking to normalize this Green New 
Deal, please just shut up.
  ``The Green New Deal is the baring of teeth by the new American 
communist, a new breed unleashed that we have seen in the streets, 
attacking people attending Trump rallies, screaming at teenagers 
wearing Make America Great Again hats, shouting down and rioting 
against conservative speakers on college campuses.
  ``Here is the truth. Socialism and communism are evil. Putting a 
shroud of legitimacy and normalcy to the destruction of the American 
ideal is being a Menshevik in a Bolshevik revolution. You cannot 
moderate the bloodlust of those who seek to enslave you by trying to 
come up with common ground or discuss alternatives to meet their needs. 
The revolution demands immediate payment.
  ``So let's stop talking about the symptoms which the Green New Deal 
represents and actually begin to dissect the disease that is 
collectivism. First, definitionally, the only difference between 
socialism and communism is if you voluntarily surrender your freedom 
and wealth or have it confiscated. Either alternative ultimately comes 
from the coercive power of the gun and are based upon the premise that 
those who have attained wealth used ill-gotten means to get it. As a 
result, they have no moral authority to keep it from those from whom it 
presumably was stolen.
  ``In socialism and communism, individual rights are not derived from 
God and guaranteed by the Constitution. Instead, everything you have 
and can expect comes from the goodwill of the government. It is no 
mistake that John Lennon's socialist anthem `Imagine' starts with the 
following words: `Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No 
hell below us; above us, only sky. Imagine all the people living for 
today.'
  ``In order to achieve a kingdom ruled by man, unfettered by morality 
or rules, you have to nix a sovereign God from the equation. If there 
is no God, then all rights are nothing more than those that the 
government chooses to allow you to have, and the only protections that 
exist are those which they grant. The only question is who gets to be 
the one holding the keys over everyone else's life.''
  This is what, on one hand, surprises me about billionaires in America 
funding a move toward socialism. Obviously, these are not stupid 
people. They can look at the history of socialism, communism. They know 
that, whether it is socialists or communists, you have two classes. You 
eliminate the middle class. There is no middle class. You have this 
small group of ruling class, and then you have everybody else, all the 
miserables.
  I guess they think they get us to socialism and they will be part of 
that elite socialist class that rules over everybody else.
  I have seen it. The summer I lived in the Soviet Union, when it was 
the real Soviet Union, there were some nice things, but it was clear 
they didn't have freedom. The government watched, through spies, 
everything that those people did.
  I asked, on one occasion: Why is that lady running off?
  Well, she is going to go report me, he said.
  Why would she go report you? You are not anything to her.
  No. In your country you can get ahead by making money. In my country, 
he said, we get ahead by stepping on others. So anybody you can turn in 
for anything, anybody that you can step on, it elevates you in our 
system here in the Soviet Union.
  He was right. And that is where we are headed with people thinking 
socialism is a good way to go.
  The bumper sticker is true. The big problem with socialism is you can 
vote your way into it, but you will have to shoot your way out.
  That is what we are seeing play out in Venezuela. They voted 
themselves


into it, and now they are having to shoot their way out. Unfortunately 
for most of them, they don't have guns, so they are pretty empty-handed 
in fighting a government that has the guns.


  It is a tragic situation. It should be one of the most prosperous 
countries in the world. It was until socialism took over. And again, as 
Rick Manning is trying to point out, that is where we are headed.
  ``It makes one wonder if Ono,'' he said, ``has given up 100 percent 
of her songwriter royalties to the song to the government as a show of 
solidarity for the dream.
  ``And here is what they don't say,'' he says, ``in order for the 
world to `live as one' with no possessions, someone is going to have to 
take all the stuff and hold it collectively for the common good.
  ``In order for there to be stuff to take and most importantly eat in 
the future, someone is going to have to do the hard work to produce it. 
Someone is going to have to figure out how to produce it, and someone 
is going to have to get it from where it is produced to where the 
brotherhood is living. And then someone is going to have to distribute 
it, being certain that everyone gets the same amount of gruel.''
  And I saw that, too, in the stores back in the Soviet Union. If you 
were part of that elite ruling class, they would keep back a really 
nice pair of shoes, maybe the only pair they got, for the highest 
ranking person that they dealt with.
  In the stores, the Soviets would tell me: We never find toilet paper; 
they hold it in the back for the ruling class. We never find good, 
fresh vegetables. They hold that back for the ruling class.
  It is really tragic the way people are treated, ultimately, in a 
socialist or communist society, or now called progressivist.
  So, good article by Brad Polumbo, February 26, How Socialism Destroys 
Private Charity and Hurts the Poor. It is tragic.
  Between what we see destroying the rule of law in America, coming 
across our southern border illegally, overwhelming our schools--how 
fair is it? If you really care about children, how fair is it to this 
big group of children in school?
  And as teachers have pointed out to me: I love my kids. I love the 
kids that come in and don't speak English. But they throw them into a 
class of English speakers because we are required to educate them, and 
we have to stop teaching, basically, the English-speaking citizens and 
residents and go to teaching the new kids that just got thrown in, no 
fault of their own. But those that suffer are the kids.
  They have dreams, but, unfortunately for them, they were either born 
here or came here legally and speak English. But their dreams are going 
to be put on hold. They are not going to be able to be educated as well 
because we have not secured our southern border. And children who don't 
speak the same language are thrown into their classes, and they are 
harming the dreams and the hopes of the children who were here.
  So is the solution to welcome in 30 million or so people from Mexico? 
No. It would overwhelm this country, and there would be no place for 
people to flee to when they are trying to find real asylum from danger.
  The better thing is just enforce the law. Secure the border. Cut off 
the flow of money to the drug cartels, and allow people to live freely 
here, without worrying about extra crime that wouldn't be here if 
people weren't here illegally.
  It is about preserving the Republic that the Founders gave us. It is 
about acknowledging that we have, as a nation, been more blessed than 
any nation in the history of the world. Solomon's Israel didn't have 
the individual opportunities, the individual assets, the freedoms that 
we have.
  When a majority of Americans fail to recognize that we have been 
blessed by God and His protective hand has secured our Nation, then 
those blessings and that protective hand will disappear; and we will be 
the once-great Camelot, where people could live free, and they could 
work and keep what they grew, built, earned, that once-great country 
where people were treated the same, whether poor or rich. They were 
treated the same under the law.
  That once-great country. Wow, what a dream. How did it go wrong?
  Well, we just talked about it, and it is time we did something 
together to stop it.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

655,JEREMIAH G. HAMILTON,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE229-2,0,Mr. NADLER,"  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Black History Month, I 
rise today to commemorate the life of Jeremiah G. Hamilton, the first 
black millionaire in the United States, whose story has been absent 
from the history books. I have the honor of representing the district 
in which Mr. Hamilton lived and worked.
  Born in the West Indies in 1807, Mr. Hamilton made his way to New 
York in 1828 and began amassing his fortune by selling stocks to both 
black and white entrepreneurs. He was touted as being astute in 
successfully predicting the markets and became a prominent financier 
and businessman on Wall Street in the pre-Civil War era.
  Mr. Hamilton defied many conventions of his time as he rose to the 
top of the business world. He owned stock of railroad companies on 
whose trains he was not legally allowed to ride. He married a white 
woman named Eliza Morris and had a close relationship with his friend 
Benjamin Day, who was the publisher of the Sun Newspaper. He took on 
titans of industry, including battling Cornelius Vanderbilt over 
control of the Accessory Transit Company until he got a settlement. In 
fact, in Vanderbilt's obituary it is stated, ``There was only one man 
who ever fought the Commodore to the end, and that was Jeremiah 
Hamilton . . . the Commodore respected him.''
  However, Mr. Hamilton faced the horrors of the rampant racism and 
violence against African-Americans in the mid-19th century. In the 
1830s, insurance companies blackballed him and refused to underwrite 
his business ventures. During the draft riots in 1863, white men 
unsuccessfully sought to lynch Mr. Hamilton in his own home.
  Jeremiah G. Hamilton died in 1875, leaving behind an estate of $2 
million, which would be around $45 million today.
  It is vital that the history of America reflects the lives of all 
Americans, and I am proud to help share some of the lost history from 
the 10th Congressional District.
  Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
not only the life of Jeremiah G. Hamilton but the dedicated work of 
both the Committee to Commemorate Jeremiah G. Hamilton and historian 
Shane White to create a permanent place in history for the first 
African-American millionaire.
  The Committee to Commemorate Jeremiah G. Hamilton was established in 
February 2018 by community activists, including Dr. Sam D. Albert, Hon. 
Louise Dankberg, Hon. Alan J. Gerson, Gail Green, Barbara Guinan, Greg 
Lambert, Esq., Christine Merritt, Hon. Daisy Paez, Mark P. Thompson, 
Leona Zeplin and the Committee's Co-Chairs Dolores Leito and Hon. 
Michelle D. Winfield.

656,RECOGNIZING MIKE LONG,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2276-4,0,Ms. STEFANIK,"  Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 
chairman of the Conservative Party of New York and my good friend, Mike 
Long, who has stepped down from this position after decades of service.
  Mike Long was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in southern 
Queens. In 1959, Mike Long dropped out of the 12th grade to enlist in 
the United States Marine Corps. He felt strongly that his duty was to 
our country.
  That commitment to sacrifice and service above self is a common 
thread throughout Chairman Long's life. He served on the New York City 
Council for a term representing Brooklyn, and he stepped up to become 
chairman of the Conservative Party, a position he held for 30 years, 
which is a testament to his character, commitment, work ethic, and 
determination to stand up for his principles.
  He is a lifelong advocate for limited government, economic freedom 
and opportunity, constitutional liberties, and improving the lives of 
everyday, hardworking New Yorkers. He is one of the rare political 
leaders in New York who has earned deep respect from both his political 
allies and his political opponents.
  I am proud to count him as a true friend, and I want to thank him, 
his wife, Eileen, and his family for his lifetime of service to New 
York State and the United States of America.

and service enriched us and whose passing continues to leave a void in 
the community. He is sorely missed.
  Mr. DelPizzo's service in the United States Army demonstrated his 
devotion to our nation. We will be forever indebted to him and all the 
brave men and women who have put their lives on the line for our 
beloved country. It gives me great pleasure to give him one final 
salute.
  Mr. DelPizzo modeled a life of love, sustaining a 63-year marriage to 
Palma Antonia Santoro DelPizzo.
  The pleasure of having known Charles DelPizzo is carried in the 
hearts and minds of his family and friends. Mr. DelPizzo's memory is 
forever cherished by his daughter Paula; Son-in-law Andrew; 
Grandchildren Angela, Melissa, and Andrew; great grandchildren Anthony, 
Talia, and Larissa; and all who knew and loved him.
  I hope Paula continues to take comfort in the memories she has made 
with her beloved father. A person that departs from this earth never 
truly leaves, for they are still alive in our hearts and minds; through 
us, they live on. May she continue to find solace in the memory of 
Charles DelPizzo's love and the celebration of his life.
  On behalf of the constituents of Ohio's Eleventh Congressional

awareness for Children's Dental Health Month.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today because tooth decay is the number one 
chronic infectious disease among children in the United States, and the 
impact of untreated tooth decay goes far beyond oral health.
  Having been a dentist for over 30 years, this issue is something that 
I have witnessed firsthand, and it is something I have great concern 
for. This is why the American Dental Association has dedicated February 
as National Children's Dental Health Month. This annual celebration 
allows dentists and volunteers to spread awareness and prevention tips 
that help parents, teachers, and others.
  Attitudes and habits established at an early age are critical in 
maintaining good oral health and oral health that lasts throughout 
life. Ensuring that children and adults get quality and accessible oral 
health care should remain a priority for everyone throughout the year.
  Remember, if you ignore your teeth, they will go away.

668,IN COMMEMORATION OF JUDGE JAMES DEAN,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2295-2,0,Mr. SPANO,"  Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an 
unsung hero in Florida's history.
  In 1858, James Dean was born into slavery in Ocala, Florida. In 
pursuit of his dream to enter public office, Dean entered Howard 
University School of Law working part time as a clerk to put himself 
through school.
  He earned a bachelor's and master's of law, graduating as the 
valedictorian in both degrees. After graduating, Dean returned home to 
Florida in 1887, taking a position as a school principal and 
establishing a law practice in Key West.
  His practice grew so quick that he had to resign from the school 
within a year to care for his clients. As his business grew, so did his 
standing in the community. In 1888, just a year after moving to Key 
West, he was nominated to serve as a county judge.
  This didn't sit well with many White political leaders in Key West 
who conspired to have him removed from the bench. They fabricated a 
story that Judge Dean illegally married an interracial couple and the 
Governor of Florida removed him from office.
  As Black History Month comes to a close today, it is important to not 
shy away from uncomfortable moments in our history. And while Governor 
Bush posthumously reinstating his judgeship in 2002 can never make up 
for the harm suffered, remembering his story makes us all more 
sensitive to current injustices suffered by our friends in the Black 
community.

669,WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1584-3,0,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the White House recently unveiled the 
Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, W-GDP, an 
interagency plan to increase women's global labor force participation 
and advancement in the workplace, improve access of women entrepreneurs 
to market opportunities, and remove barriers to economic growth for 
women.
  I support the initiative, although not based on the erroneous claim 
of some in the White House that it is the first women's initiative ever 
launched by the United States. On the contrary, I and many other 
Members of Congress and previous administrations have supported such 
efforts for many years. However, there is still a lot of work to be 
done, and I hope W-GDP builds on those efforts.
  Too many of this administration's actions have fallen far short of 
the President's rhetoric or have been the antithesis of what he 
promised, so while I am ready to do what is necessary to support W-GDP, 
I worry that this initiative may be part of the same story. From human 
trafficking at the southern border, to processing asylum applicants, to 
combating HIV/AIDS, this administration purports to be serious about 
addressing global problems while implementing policies or proposing 
budgets that bear no resemblance to effective solutions and in many 
cases would make the situation worse.
  For example, while the objectives of W-GDP are laudable, it is being 
implemented by the same White House that sought to cut the budget for 
the Department of State and foreign assistance programs by roughly 30 
percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, cuts that would have decimated 
funding for programs that address the needs of the world's poorest 
people, for water and sanitation, maternal and child health, education 
and employment opportunities, to stave off poverty and disease that 
disproportionately afflict women and girls. In fact, the President's 
budget did not include a single dollar for W-GDP.
  This administration has also waged war on reproductive health, 
reportedly directing the omission of reporting on reproductive rights 
in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights, and 
one of President Trump's first acts after his inauguration was to 
reinstate the Global Gag Rule. In fact, egged on by extremists in his 
administration, he expanded it to condition funding for every 
nongovernmental organization, NGO, implementing any health programs for 
the United States overseas, even if their programs have nothing to do 
with reproductive health. In other words, if an NGO spends millions of 
dollars in India to combat HIV/AIDS, but spends $1 of its own private 
funds--not U.S. taxpayer funds--to provide counseling on abortion, it 
is ineligible for any U.S. Government funding for either purpose. Such 
a policy would be unlawful in our own country.
  So while I support W-GDP, I caution all those who defend women's 
rights and support economic opportunities for women to not be 
distracted by one initiative this administration launched on the backs 
of the Congress's rejection of President Trump's budget and to call on 
the White House to adopt a more consistent, comprehensive approach to 
supporting women around the world.
  With that in mind, I hope the White House will speak out forcefully 
and consistently about the institutionalized and systemic persecution 
and discrimination of women in Saudi Arabia and other countries whose 
autocratic and corrupt governments this White House has embraced. If 
the White House expects to be taken seriously about women's 
empowerment, it cannot remain silent about governments whose laws and 
policies treat women as property and that imprison women's rights 
activists.
  This is not the only area in which the administration is purporting 
to support vulnerable populations while its short-sighted policies are 
having the opposite effect.
  In a November 30, 2018, op-ed in the Washington Post, Ivanka Trump 
announced that the administration had


decided to limit the number of waivers for assistance for countries 
that are identified in the State Department's annual Trafficking in 
Persons Report as failing to meet minimum standards for combating human 
trafficking. She also noted the administration's pledge of $45 million 
to a fund to end modern slavery, funds that, as is true for W-GDP, the 
President did not include in his budget and from an account the White 
House proposed to cut.
  I agree with the goal of holding governments accountable for failing 
to meet minimum standards for preventing trafficking in persons, but 
informed people know that cutting funding for health, education, 
environmental conservation, counterterrorism, and governance programs 
does nothing to prevent human trafficking, while it undercuts our 
ability to make progress on other issues of national interest.
  Yet that is exactly what the administration has done. By belatedly 
approaching human trafficking as if nothing else matters and limiting 
use of the waiver authority Congress provided, administration officials 
have spent months tying themselves in knots over which programs to 
continue and which to suspend. The result is that implementing partners 
are running out of money, services are not being delivered, and 
important programs are shutting down.
  The Trump administration needs to stop governing by sound bite. If 
the White House is serious about addressing human trafficking and other 
complex challenges, it should work with Congress to secure the 
necessary funding and apply the law in a common sense manner that is 
consistent with our national interests.

682,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE227-4,0,Ms. ESHOO,"  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I'm very proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 8, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, the most significant gun 
violence legislation to be considered in the House in over a decade. 
H.R. 8 strengthens our current laws on background checks by closing 
loopholes and ensuring that dangerous people do not have the 
opportunity to purchase a weapon. This legislation is critical and long 
overdue because 40 percent of gun sales are made with no background 
check at all.
  Over 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, 
support universal background checks. Why? Because they help keep guns 
out of the hands of criminals. The current system has already stopped 
three million gun sales to convicted felons and others who are 
prohibited by law from owning a firearm. These checks do nothing to 
infringe upon the right of law-abiding citizens to keep and use 
firearms for recreation, subsistence, or even self-defense, and 
importantly, the vast majority of background checks are completed 
within minutes.
  When the Supreme Court first recognized an individual's right to 
carry a gun in the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, it also 
acknowledged that the Second Amendment does not prevent Congress from 
imposing reasonable restrictions on gun sales. The right of responsible 
citizens to keep and bear arms must be carefully weighed against the 
right of all Americans to live in a safe society, and I believe H.R. 8 
strikes the right balance between protecting the latter without 
infringing upon the former.
  For too long, unreasonable forces have prevented serious 
consideration of virtually any gun legislation, no matter how 
commonsense it is. Ninety-six Americans are killed by a gun every day, 
and we owe it to them, their families, and the people of Newtown, 
Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland, and so many other communities to take 
meaningful action. Too many innocent lives have been taken and the 
American people deserve so much better.
  I wish to thank the thousands of devoted activists, including Moms 
Demand Action, for raising their voices across my Congressional 
District and across our country to end gun violence in our nation.

689,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,4,Mr. NADLER,"  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, I am pleased that today we are considering H.R. 1112, 
the Enhanced Background Checks Act.
  Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act, an important bill to expand our national firearms background check 
system to include virtually all gun transfers.
  However, there are also steps we can take to make the current 
background check system more effective at blocking the sale of guns to 
individuals who are ineligible to purchase and possess them.
  That is why I support H.R. 1112, a bill that addresses a dangerous 
shortcoming in the current firearms background check law.
  In most cases, a licensed gun dealer receives notification within a 
few minutes, often 90 seconds, from the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System, sometimes called the NICS, that a prospective 
buyer has passed or failed the background check.
  In a small percentage of cases, NICS examiners may require additional 
time to complete the background check if information is missing or 
unclear in a prospective buyer's record. For example, there may be on 
the record a notation that the prospective buyer was arrested but no 
notation as to whether the buyer was acquitted or convicted. That would 
have to be looked into further.
  However, under current law, a licensed gun dealer conducting a 
background check on a prospective purchaser is permitted to sell the 
firearm to the purchaser if there has been no determination from NICS 
after 3 business days, even though NICS has not indicated that the 
person has actually passed the background check.
  Often, we refer to this as a default proceed transaction.
  These are the very cases that ought to be investigated. In 2017 
alone, the ATF determined that over 4,000 default proceed firearms 
transfers went to purchasers who should not lawfully have gotten them 
because they could not lawfully own a firearm.
  If NICS is unable to return an instant determination, and especially 
if there is no report after 3 days, there is real cause for concern.
  One notable example of the tragic consequences of this loophole is 
the hate crime murder of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.
  In that tragedy, the shooter was not legally allowed to possess a 
firearm as a result of drug charges, but he still was able to purchase 
his gun from a licensed dealer, who made the decision to transfer after 
3 business days had elapsed, despite not having received a definitive 
response from the background check system.
  The bill before us today, H.R. 1112, would strengthen the background 
check procedures Federal firearms licensees or dealers must follow 
before selling or transferring a firearm.
  Under this bill, the initial period a gun dealer must wait for an 
answer from the NICS is extended from 3 days to 10 days. If, after 10 
days, the NICS system has not returned an answer to the dealer, the 
prospective purchaser may file a petition with the attorney general, 
which should help resolve most applications in short order.
  If an additional 10 days elapses without a response from NICS, the 
licensed firearms dealer then may sell or transfer the firearm to the 
prospective purchaser without the background check completion, if the 
dealer has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from 
obtaining a firearm under Federal, State, or local law.
  The additional time for checks to be completed will help prevent the 
transfer of guns to individuals who are ineligible to possess them and 
will make us safer.
  I want to remind everyone that, in 90 percent of the cases, the NICS 
system gives the answer within 90 seconds. So we are talking about a 
small number of cases, but a number of cases where we know there have 
been tragic results. We want to stop that.
  I commend our colleague Congressman  Jim Clyburn, the distinguished 
Democratic whip, for introducing this bipartisan bill, which is a 
sensible and necessary approach to addressing this dangerous 
shortcoming in current law.

  Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill 
today, and I reserve the balance of my time.",N000002,2019-02-28
690,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,5,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia,"  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Chair, here we go again. Just like yesterday, our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle voted to criminalize the transfer of a 
firearm between two law-abiding citizens.
  Today, they further reveal this interest by bringing up a bill that 
would prohibit law-abiding citizens from ever being able to acquire 
firearms. And that is not hyperbole, Madam Chair; it is fact.
  Let me briefly explain how that would happen. Allow me to walk 
through the mechanics of this legislation.
  Let's start at the beginning of the month. Assume I went to a Federal 
firearms licensee, an FFL, to purchase a firearm on Friday, February 1, 
of this month. Under H.R. 1112, the FBI's NICS system has 10 business 
days to respond to the FFL.
  The tenth business day is a Friday, February the 15th. If, after 
those 10 business days, NICS does not okay the transfer, I must file a 
petition with the Department of Justice certifying that I have no 
reason to believe that I am prohibited by Federal, State, or local law 
from purchasing or possessing a firearm.
  Once that petition is filed, the NICS system has an additional 10 
days to make a determination. That would be Monday, March 5, in our 
example because February 18 was a Federal holiday and not a business 
day.
  If, at the conclusion of the 20 business days waiting period, NICS 
does not deny the transfer, I could then acquire the firearm.
  But wait, Madam Chair. Under existing law, the NICS background check 
is only valid for 30 calendar days from the date it is initiated. Under 
our example, that would be Saturday, March the 2nd, which is 2 days 
before my petition is required to be acted upon.


  At that point, I would be required to start the process over again 
entirely. There could be no end to this cycle.
  Now, I am not sure if H.R. 1112 was written this way out of just 
messed-up writing or malice. I am not sure. But it does do this, and 
there is no mistaking what is written.
  As I have said many times, we do not vote on aspirational ideas in 
this Chamber. They are great to debate, but we do not vote on 
aspirational ideas. We vote on words on paper, and words on paper are 
just as I have described.
  I will let the American people determine what the intent was here. 
However, as I noted yesterday, in the rush to put this to the floor, 
they did not bother to fix some several major issues.
  We also know, as we go forward in this that this indefinite and 
perpetual delay of the transfer of firearms to law-abiding citizens is 
perhaps the intent of this bill.
  Keep in mind, under current law, an FFL has the option to transfer 
the firearm after 3 business days unless the transfer has been denied 
by NICS.
  I would contend that 3 business days is not instant and a month is 
anything but instant, particularly as technologies continue to advance.
  These laws have real-world consequences, and consequences can be 
deadly.
  Carol Bowne was a New Jersey resident with a restraining order 
against her ex-boyfriend. Her application for a firearm took longer 
than 40 days to process, and he stabbed her to death while she was 
waiting to legally protect herself.
  Let that sink in.
  This bill would empower abusers and violent predators by making their 
victims more vulnerable.
  Madam Chair, we oppose this legislation. It doesn't make sense in its 
current form. It will do nothing to make our communities safer, but it 
will make it harder for law-abiding citizens to exercise their Second 
Amendment rights and to defend themselves and their families.
  Madam Chair, I am not often going to be able to say this, but I am 
joined today by the ACLU, who is opposing this bill and scoring against 
this bill.
  It is not ready for prime time. It is ready to go back to actually 
have hearings and actually do markups and actually work with this bill.
  I appreciate the gentleman, especially, from South Carolina's intent. 
No one fights stronger for his constituency than the gentleman from 
South Carolina. This is just not the right piece of legislation at the 
right time for the reasons that I spoke of, that have nothing to do 
with the intent. It has everything to do with words on paper. Remember, 
Madam Chair, that is what we vote on, not aspirational ideas.
  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-28

692,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,7,Mr. CLYBURN,"  Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Chair, I thank my friend for yielding me the time.
  Madam Chair, let me begin my remarks, first of all, by welcoming to 
our Capitol today Miss Jennifer Pinckney and her two daughters. They 
are the wife and children of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along 
with eight of his Bible study parishioners, lost his life to a demented 
white supremacist who said that he was interested in starting a race 
war.
  He entered their church, participated in the Bible study, into which 
they welcomed him. And, as they closed their study that evening and 
prayed for what they had experienced and for their next meeting, this 
gentleman, while their eyes were closed, opened his and slaughtered 
them.
  I find it interesting that my colleague has talked about the 
inconvenience of waiting longer than 3 days to purchase a weapon, 
without mentioning those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church.

  He has talked about people who might be inconvenienced; he has talked 
about something he read in the newspapers; but he has not mentioned 
them. Well, I am here today to say that the Members of this august body 
need to think a little bit about the value of those lives.
  Are they more valuable than the inconvenience a gun purchaser may 
have by having to wait 10 rather than 3 days to make a purchase?
  What would make one so anxious to purchase a gun in the first place? 
If you have got to have a gun right now, chances are you have no useful 
purpose, no redeeming value, in the purchase of that gun.
  Maybe we ought to participate here, as Members of this body, in 
helping this purchaser with a cooling-off period, which is all we are 
asking to do here.
  Charleston, South Carolina, is nicknamed the ``Holy City.'' Churches 
and steeples dominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until 
recently, had an ordinance that no building could be constructed higher 
than 55 feet, wanting nothing to obstruct its steeples.
  Faith is fundamental to the Charleston community. However, that faith 
was rocked in June 2015 when this lone gunman rushed into this Bible 
study, after having studied the most historic African American churches 
in the State of South Carolina and developing a list of five churches, 
one of which was Emanuel AME.
  He, by his own admission, selected this church because of its 
importance to the African American community, being the first organized 
place of worship in the South for African Americans.


  He selected this. This was a hate crime of the first order, and we 
are saying we should not inconvenience him. And we did not 
inconvenience him. We allowed him to get that gun after 3 days, when it 
was around the fifth day that they found the glitch in the system and 
found him to be ineligible to own a gun.
  We just had a gunman go into his workplace in Aurora, Illinois. He 
was ineligible to have a gun, but he was allowed to purchase the gun. 
When they found out that he was ineligible to have a gun, they then 
sent him a letter and said: Please bring us the gun back. You are not 
eligible to have a gun.
  Give me a break. No, he didn't return the gun, because he had no 
redeeming value in having a gun. And he murdered his coworkers. And you 
are telling me we should not inconvenience him.
  Well, my colleague, the chair of the committee, has laid out for you 
the procedure in this bill, a procedure that makes it a maximum, 
irrespective of what my colleague may say, it is a maximum of 20 
working days, business days, that one would have in order to purchase a 
gun.
  I would hope, as we move forward here today, we would think about 
those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church, and we think about those 4,000 
people, 4,200 people, who purchased guns in 2016 using this loophole, 
and the 4,800 people who purchased guns in 2017 using this loophole. 
Think about their families. Think about their children. And think about 
what we are about to do here today.",C000537,2019-02-28

prepared to say here today.
  In troubling times, many of us find solace in the Serenity Prayer: 
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the 
courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom--wisdom--to know the 
difference.
  The Charleston loophole is something all Members of Congress should 
have the courage to change and, by doing so, grant the American people 
the serenity they deserve in their schools, in their entertainment 
venues, in their neighborhood streets, and, God forbid, in their places 
of worship.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act of 2019.
  Charleston, South Carolina, is nicknamed the Holy City. Church spires 
dominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until recently, had 
an ordinance that no building could be constructed higher than 55 feet. 
In this city, faith is foundational. It is a source of strength and 
community that dates back centuries.
  However, that faith was rocked in June 2015 when a lone gunman 
punctuated his participation in a Bible study at Emanuel AME


Church with gunshots fired upon the parishioners who had welcomed him, 
killing nine and wounding three others. The shooter targeted this place 
of worship because of its historic significance to the African-American 
community. This egregious hate crime shattered the sanctity of the Holy 
City, and in response Congress observed a moment of silence and all 
Americans offered thoughts and prayers.
  While a moment of silence and our thoughts and prayers are 
appreciated in times of tragedy, they do nothing to solve the 
underlying problem. The real tragedy in Charleston is it could have 
been prevented. The gunman acquired the weapon used in the massacre 
because of a fault in the law that is now known as the Charleston 
Loophole. The gun purchase was subject to a background check; however, 
when a glitch in the system caused the background review to take more 
than the three-day limit allowed by law, the gunman was able to 
purchase the weapon, although it was later found that he was ineligible 
to purchase a gun. The system failed to stop this gun sale to an 
ineligible purchaser and 4,864 others in 2017.
  It has been 25 years since the Brady Bill became law, and there has 
been no significant legislation enacted since to stem gun violence. Yet 
in 2017, 100 people were killed each day in this country with a 
firearm--which touches every district represented in this august body.
  A vote in support of the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 
extends the time allowed for law enforcement to conduct background 
checks. Under this bill, if the background check isn't concluded within 
10 business days, the purchaser can request an expedited background 
check, which notifies law enforcement of the urgency of the review and 
starts an additional 10 business day period for the background check to 
be completed. While more than 96 percent of background checks are 
completed within three days--and 90 percent of Americans support 
background checks--this expedited review allows for law enforcement to 
complete the small percentage that may take longer than three days. If 
at the end of the expedited review the background check is 
inconclusive, then the purchase may proceed.
  Restricting the Charleston Loophole doesn't prohibit law abiding 
citizens from purchasing a gun, but it does provide more time, if 
needed, for law enforcement to ensure weapons are not sold to those 
with criminal convictions or mental illness. This is an important first 
step our country should take to protect our citizens and their first 
amendment rights.
  In troubling times many of us find solace in the Serenity prayer--
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the 
difference.'' The Charleston Loophole is something all Members of 
Congress should have the courage to change and grant the American 
people the serenity they deserve in their schools, entertainment 
venues, neighborhood streets and--God forbid--their places of worship.",C000537,2019-02-28

may consume.
  Look, I have great sympathy for what the gentleman from South 
Carolina just spoke of. But, also, I have even greater sympathy for the 
fact it could have been avoided and had nothing, frankly, to do at the 
end when the FBI under Mr. Comey actually admitted that there were 
mistakes made. The FBI could have stopped that instead of letting it 
happen. They saw problems. They let it go. It could have stopped.
  This was already in law, Madam Chair. It could have stopped.
  Yes, what I laid out for you is not just simply 20 business days, 
when you look at the fact that, coupled with other restrictions, it can 
do what we said.
  I have great sympathy and grief for every loss of life, no matter 
where it comes from. But to simply say that this would have fixed it, 
when the FBI and others knew they could have fixed it at that moment 
and could have went later and got the guns, because there was a delay 
even in the horrific act that happened--again, we are simply talking 
about what is on the paper.
  Madam Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McClintock).",C001093,2019-02-28
697,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,12,Mr. McCLINTOCK,"  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Chairman, we all deplore and mourn the 
monstrous, despicable, and evil massacre in Charleston. But that 
terrible crime was committed 67 days after the perpetrator applied to 
purchase the firearm.
  As Mr. Collins said, this was preventable if, under current law, it 
was a failure of the FBI and not of the law.
  This bill is not about public safety. Most gun predators already get 
their firearms illegally. A recent Johns Hopkins study found that 
California's universal background check had no effect on gun violence.
  Their true objective is to make gun ownership by law-abiding people 
so legally hazardous and so bureaucratically time-consuming that people 
simply give up. This bill cleverly and, I believe, insidiously sets up 
a potentially never-ending bureaucratic review process.
  As Mr. Collins said, a background check is only good for 30 calendar 
days from the day you apply. But this bill sets up a 20-business-day 
delay process. Now, what that means is, if a single holiday falls 
within that window, or the store is closed on weekends, or you slip a 
single day on that timetable, your background check is no longer valid, 
and you have to start all over again in a perpetual cycle of Kafkaesque 
proportions.
  Now, would a bureaucracy be so abusive as to play this game? Well, of 
course it would. Just ask Lois Lerner.",M001177,2019-02-28

Checks Act of 2019 as a commonsense measure to improve the current 
firearms background check system and to save lives.
  Twenty-five years ago today, we began implementation of the Brady 
Background Checks Act. The system it employs to run background checks 
on those seeking to purchase firearms from licensed gun dealers has 
made us safer.
  Now it is time to address the circumstances in which the FBI needs 
additional time to investigate information relating to a prospective 
purchaser when the records may not be immediately clear as to whether 
someone is legally allowed to purchase a firearm.
  Under current law, after 3 days, a gun dealer has the discretion to 
sell a gun to a purchaser, if the system has not given a green light to 
the sale after 3 business days have passed without a denial being 
issued by the system. In these circumstances, it is the choice of the 
dealer as to whether to proceed with the sale, which we call a default 
proceed, or whether to wait for the check to be implemented.
  The results of such a choice were tragic in Charleston, South 
Carolina, in 2015, when a young man filled with hate shot and killed 
nine worshippers at the Emanuel AME Church. The gun used in this murder 
had been transferred by a gun dealer to the shooter even though the 
check had not been completed by the FBI, but would have resulted in a 
denial had the check been finished.
  This is not an isolated incident. Since 1994, gun sellers proceeded 
with between 3,000 and 4,000 default proceed sales per year. Analyzing 
data provided by the Department of Justice, one study found that such 
sales are eight times more likely to involve a prohibited purchaser 
than other background checks.
  In 2017 alone, default proceed sales accounted for more than 4,800 
transfers to purchasers who were prohibited from owning firearms. The 
FBI reported that, in 2007 and 2008, in cases a licensed seller sold a 
firearm through default proceed transfers----",B001270,2019-02-28

for the time.
  Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1112. This 
legislation is an attack on the constitutional rights of


Americans. This bill puts incredible roadblocks in the way of law-
abiding citizens seeking to exercise their Second Amendment rights that 
are guaranteed to them in the Constitution.
  We should be focused on enforcing the current laws that we have on 
the books instead of passing Federal mandates that stifle freedom. This 
bill creates a bureaucratic maze that will allow the Federal Government 
to sit on its hands and force citizens to submit formal petitions to 
the Attorney General when they are trying to legally purchase a 
firearm, to ask permission to exercise their constitutional right.
  What other constitutional right would you suggest we put this level 
of restriction on? The freedom of the press? The freedom of religion? 
Should we start having the Federal Government review every media 
outlet's story for 10 days before they can be published? before a 
church can meet for worship? I don't think so.
  It is my hope that we will soon move forward with solutions, 
solutions that will actually make a difference for hardworking 
Americans across this great country.
  When I was sworn in as a Member of the House earlier this year, I saw 
great potential for Congress to come together and advance solutions to 
our Nation's greatest problems. Instead, I find myself standing here on 
the floor of this Chamber fighting for the basic liberties that our 
Founding Fathers sought to guarantee for every American.

every day, and I urge the House to reject this misguided legislation.",C001118,2019-02-28

community, whether they are at work, at home, at school, or at church.
  Less than 2 weeks ago, five people, four of whom were my 
constituents, left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt Company in 
Aurora, Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken by a 
horrific act of gun violence.
  I am committed to honoring the lives of the victims of gun violence 
through action. H.R. 1112 is an important bill that will help address a 
deficiency in background check laws by allowing law enforcement to 
conduct a thorough background check. I am proud to cosponsor an 
amendment that will help ensure this legislation improves the safety of 
victims of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence, 
sexual assault, and stalking.
  Yesterday was the first time in more than two decades that this U.S. 
House of Representatives passed a major gun safety bill, and today we 
have an opportunity to take a further step. H.R. 1112 will help save 
innocent lives, and I look forward to working on commonsense 
legislation that balances protecting our gun rights and ensuring the 
safety of our communities.",U000040,2019-02-28

yielding.
  Madam Chair, I rise today to fight for the rights of the brave men 
and women who have risked their lives fighting for our rights.
  The bill we are debating, H.R. 1112, would have a significant impact 
on veterans' Second Amendment rights. A little-known and poorly 
understood provision of H.R. 1112 would amend the law to make it 
unlawful for an individual who has been ``adjudicated with mental 
illness, severe developmental disability, or severe emotional 
instability'' to purchase, to possess a firearm. It would make it 
illegal to sell a firearm to such an individual.
  Let's put this in perspective. There are over 1.6 million disabled 
veterans with service-connected adjudication by VA of mental illness, 
including 1 million veterans with PTSD. H.R. 1112 has the potential to 
add all those names of veterans to the FBI NICS list and prevent those 
veterans from being able to purchase or possess a firearm.
  Now, I know that may not have been the intent of the author of this 
bill, but that is a lot of veterans who will be impacted if this 
becomes law.
  I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee to clarify that 
veterans with VA PTSD, diagnosed mental illness, and other affected 
adjudications would be exempted from the bill's standards, but it was 
ruled out of order.
  VA already sends the names of veterans who have a VA fiduciary for 
inclusion on the NICS list--not because there is a concern that the 
veteran might be a harm to themselves or others, but because the VA has 
determined that the veteran needs assistance handling his or her 
financial benefits.


  I am concerned that the expanded definition proposed in H.R. 1112 
would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of over 1 million 
veterans solely because they receive benefits from VA that they have 
rightly earned through their service to our great country.
  The last thing any of us in this room want to do is to discourage 
veterans from seeking VA benefits and treatment because they are afraid 
it might cost them a constitutional right. Think about that.
  Although there may not have been a finding by a judicial authority 
that a veteran poses a danger to themselves or society, these veterans 
will be told that they were good enough to use a firearm to fight for 
our freedoms, but they are not good enough to have the freedom to bear 
arms as a civilian.
  That is wrong, Madam Chair. Even criminals must be convicted in a 
court of law before their names are added to the NICS list.
  Of all Americans who deserve their constitutional rights, the most 
deserving are those who fought for our country. Madam Chair, that is 
why I strongly oppose H.R. 1112, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
``no'' on this bill.

  Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background 
Checks Act of 2019.
  After losing my son Jordan to gun violence in 2012, I began reaching 
out to other families who recently lost a loved one to gun violence. I 
would send them letters. That is how I came to know Reverend Sharon 
Risher of Charlotte, North Carolina.
  On June 17, 2017, Reverend Risher lost her mother, two cousins, and a 
childhood friend when a young man shot and killed nine people during a 
prayer service at the Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
Today, with H.R. 1112, we can close the loophole in background checks 
for the gun purchase that led to their terrible loss. I support this 
legislation for Reverend Sharon Risher and the memory of her family and 
her loved ones.
  Tragically, this was not the last time our country witnessed horrific 
violence in a place of worship. A few months ago, the shooting at the 
Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took the lives of 
11 human beings.
  Our places of worship, whether they are churches, synagogues, 
mosques, or something else, should be safe places of love, support, and 
community. H.R. 1112 would allow law enforcement the time that they 
need to make sure all these community centers are places of peace and 
safety.
  Yesterday, we voted to expand background checks. Today, we vote to 
make sure those background checks are thorough, even if a few of them 
take a few more days to process. Those few extra days will save lives.
  In the days after the Emanuel shooting, I was there in the community 
praying with the community and dealing with their pain and loss. 
America deserves better than this.
  Why not make sure that we are doing everything that we can to protect 
them? A few more days in making sure that the FBI has the ability to 
really soundly make a conscious and critical decision, America deserves 
that.

consume.
  Madam Chair, I heard the argument from the other side a moment ago 
that people adjudged ineligible for the system by the VA, that their 
names


should not be given into the system so that they may purchase firearms.
  I would point out that one of the largest sources of mortality among 
veterans is suicide. Veterans are, I think, the highest group in our 
society in terms of suicide rate. So it really makes sense to make it 
easier for people adjudged not to be proper to have a gun to have a gun 
if you are worried about suicides. That argument is, frankly, 
nonsensical. I am very glad the VA helps protect our veterans by 
participating in the system.
  Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island 
(Mr. Cicilline), a member of the committee and the chairman of one of 
our subcommittees.",N000002,2019-02-28

  Madam Chair, I would just point out in further support of Mr. 
Nadler's remarks, on average, 20 veterans commit suicide every single 
day in this country, and two-thirds of those suicides are caused by use 
of a gun. So Mr. Nadler is quite right.
  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1112 to close the 
Charleston loophole.
  We have heard a lot about what is at stake in terms of constitutional 
rights as it relates to possession of a firearm. There are other 
constitutional rights that are at issue here, and that is the right to 
life, liberty, the right to live free of gun violence and death, the 
right of a grandmother to sit on her porch and enjoy a summer evening 
free from the dangers of gun violence, the right of young children to 
play in a playground and play safely.
  So this legislation is very important because it closes a very 
significant loophole in our law.
  Over the last two decades, the Charleston loophole has allowed more 
than 60,000 purchases of guns by prohibited individuals.
  Let that sink in.
  Sixty thousand people who are prohibited from having a gun by law 
were allowed to get those guns because of this loophole.
  One of those purchasers was a white supremacist who used the gun that 
he purchased to kill nine worshippers at the Mother Emanuel Church in 
South Carolina. Even though he had a felony drug charge on his record, 
this killer was able to buy a gun because his background check wasn't 
completed in 3 days.
  And he isn't the only one, of course. A 2016 GAO report found that, 
between 2006 and 2015, guns were transferred to about 6,700 people with 
domestic violence convictions and more than 500 individuals with 
prohibiting protective orders.
  So there are many, many examples where the American people are less 
safe because criminals and disqualified people can access a firearm 
because the background check wasn't completed in 3 days. This is a very 
simple commonsense solution to that problem.
  Our laws will not work if we don't keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals, dangerous people, other disqualified purchasers, and this 
bill does that. This is a commonsense proposal.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I 
thank Mr. Clyburn for his leadership, and I thank Mr. Nadler for 
bringing these bills before the Judiciary Committee so we can finally 
take some responsible action to reduce gun violence in this country.",C001084,2019-02-28

thing I will agree on with my friend just now is I do agree that there

  Madam Chair, at this time I would like to address a concern that has 
been raised by one section of the bill that is unrelated to the changes 
to current law to address the Charleston loophole.
  Section 3 of the bill replaces outdated and offensive terminology in 
the categories of individuals who are ineligible to purchase or possess 
firearms under current law. Among those included, there are individuals 
subject to such prohibitions because, as stated by the current law, 
they are ``adjudicated as a mental defective.''
  At the Judiciary Committee's markup of the bill, we agreed with our 
ranking member, Representative Collins, to replace this offensive 
language and to insert different terminology in the bill as a 
placeholder as we work to develop alternative language that does not 
alter the scope of who is included in these prohibitions and to work 
with stakeholders who have an interest in how this would be 
accomplished.
  We have heard from various advocates in the mental health, disability 
rights, and veterans communities who have expressed their desire to 
develop an acceptable alternative. We agree.
  Yesterday, the Veterans of Foreign Wars brought their concerns 
related to this issue to our attention. The VFW agrees that the current 
terminology is archaic but is concerned about a potential unintended 
consequence of replacing it.
  Their concern is that replacing these terms with ``mental illness,'' 
``severe developmental disability,'' or ``severe emotional 
instability'' could result in some veterans who are not now included 
being added to the NICS index due to their receipt of VA care or 
benefits for mental illnesses such as PTSD or traumatic brain injury.
  It is not the intent of the changes in this terminology made by 
section 3 to alter the scope of those currently considered to be 
``adjudicated as a mental defective.'' It is the intent simply to 
replace that offensive language, but not to change the underlying law.
  We will work with stakeholders, including the VFW, the mental health 
community, and the disability rights community to address the concerns 
related to this outdated terminology in a manner that does not change 
the scope of present law as this bill proceeds.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.",N000002,2019-02-28

may consume.
  Madam Chair, I do appreciate the gentleman from New York clarifying 
that, but he just clarified it in the very way--because we had brought 
this up. It was late in the day, and we brought this up, and this 
language was offensive. And, frankly, Ms. Lofgren, who was in the chair 
at the time, presented this language as an alternative to get us to a 
place where, as we talked about, we could get to Rules to actually fix 
this.
  This is why I have said so many times that I have not--I understand 
the majority's willingness to bring the bill forward. What I didn't 
understand here is the willingness of this majority to put themselves 
on a time table to bring bills that were not ready. The reason we did 
it that night was so that we could get to Rules.
  I served on the Rules Committee for 4 years. We could have fixed it 
at Rules.
  Dr. Roe actually just brought an amendment to Rules, but it was 
rejected.
  I understand that now we are going to continue forward.
  I have a daughter who has spina bifida, and many would say ``mental 
defective.'' For anyone in that community who believes that those who 
are born that way would be a mental defective is a problem. It needs to 
be fixed.
  But the problem that we have here was a committee process that broke 
and a Rules process that broke. There were plenty of opportunities to 
address this, plenty of opportunities to discuss this. In the rush to 
do, again, what I said yesterday many times, what makes you feel good 
does not always heal you, now you have a problem, a valid problem.
  But it was not a problem from the perspective of not trying to fix 
it. It came from the heart on both sides of the aisle to say this 
language is archaic, this language should not be there. There were 
plenty of times to fix it.
  I appreciate the chairman. I am glad to hear his willingness to 
continue to work on this. What would another day have taken? What 
problem would an amendment voted up or down by Dr. Roe have caused on 
the floor?

  I guess when the ACLU and others started scoring against it, we 
decided we might need to fix it.
  Again, this is a process problem. I know nobody likes to talk about 
process problems because, at the end of the day, I believe the authors' 
intents behind these bills, I believe their intents


are good. I believe their process may be wrong, and I will speak to 
that, but this is a problem that we have.
  I am glad the chairman is moving forward, I am glad the chairman is 
looking at this, and I am glad the chairman is willing to address this 
going forward, but it is just sad that we had to get here today, 
because this could have been fixed except for an arbitrary timeline put 
onto my chairman that he really had no control over, I believe, to 
bring something forward that is not ready for prime time.
  I respect my chairman. I am glad that he has addressed this. I hope 
that they will give him plenty of time in the future to continue to 
work these problems out.

  Madam Chair, our mistake was in accepting the amendment from the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins). The amendment dealt with the 
underlying language of the underlying law, not with the bill. We should 
have insisted that an attempt to correct that language be in a separate 
bill.
  The gentleman from Georgia is now telling us that we should kill this 
bill that will save so many lives because we have not figured out 
acceptable language to replace existing bad language in the existing 
law that had nothing to do with this bill.
  We should pass this bill.
  We will work as we go forward to see if we can come up with 
acceptable language, but in any event, we should pass this bill and 
deal with the separate problem of bad language in the underlying law 
separately.

and Susie Jackson, people who were murdered in their church during a 
Bible study. And I rise for the tens of thousands of Americans who will 
die if Congress does not close the Charleston loophole.
  In 2015, the FBI reported that more than 270,000 guns were sold 
because the NICS system failed to issue a ``do not sale'' order within 
3 days.
  One was sold to a man with a hate-filled heart, as we have heard. He 
walked into Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, a 
historically Black church, and murdered nine people who were simply 
seeking to get closer to their God.
  Madam Chair, we have seen this time and time again. Our houses of 
worship are not safe from gun violence: Mother Emanuel, First Baptist 
Church in Sutherland Springs, Tree of Life, Oak Creek's house of 
worship, and the list goes on and on.
  We talk about PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. Just recently, I 
heard someone in the Chicago area talk about PTSD, but it was 
``present-traumatic stress disorder'' because of all the guns that are 
in the streets in the hands of people who should not have them.
  Madam Chair, today, I challenge my colleagues to do the right thing: 
Pass this bill and save lives. Pass this bill and prevent dangerous 
people from getting guns. Pass this law because you never know if it 
will be your son or mother who could be next, gunned down by doing 
something as routine as praying.

  Madam Chair, I can go back through my opening statement and list the 
many reasons I oppose this bill that have nothing to do with the 
amendment that should have been fixed by the time we got to Rules, 
which was agreed upon. Actually, the language was given by Ms. Lofgren 
and staff, and we said that we will take that and move to Rules to fix 
it.
  If you go back and look at my statement, I am opposing this bill for 
many other reasons that are very valid. I believe when you look for 
timing, you look for other things.
  Again, I believe working the process is proper. Working the process 
will go through. The majority brought this to the floor, and they 
should have the votes to pass it. If not, then the Senate can work on 
this language, and we go forward.
  I think the bigger issue is the very fundamental issue of the timing 
of this bill, the timing that it is not just 20 days, and it is not 
just 10 days. There is another, when you couple it with the actual 30-
day restriction on the application itself. So there are plenty of 
reasons for me to oppose this bill.
  The other part was simply a discussion that should have been fixed 
and wasn't. That is a tragedy, that we are coming to the floor and that 
even be a problem. But at the end of the day, we pointed it out, we 
tried to, and that is where it is at.
  My problem with this bill is the bill itself and much of the language 
that we have here.

who, for years, has been working on this issue.
  Madam Chair, H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, 
is long in coming. It responds to many people, but it responds to 
Dylann Roof.
  In 2015, he went to a gun store to get a gun. He was not the normal 
purchaser, and it did not approve in 90 seconds, as most of them do. 
But in a day or two, when it had not yet been approved, Dylann Roof was 
able to get a gun. And Dylann Roof's whole message was: I am going to 
start a race war by going into an unlocked church on a prayer night and 
kill nine worshippers praying to their God and their pastor--whose wife 
was here today.
  The question has to be: When are we going to stop the senseless 
killings and the eons and eons of mass shootings?
  My good friend from Georgia (Mr. Collins) is a man of faith. I was in 
the committee room as a senior member on the Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations as we were trying to 
deliberate his concern, a very vital concern, one that I have, to love 
people with disabilities, to love them and treat them with dignity.
  The language in this legislation does that as best we could at the 
time, because it puts the language adjudicated, determined by some 
objective body, that you have a health problem that deals with a mental 
concern.
  The question has to be, if it is not workable, you pass the bill. All 
of us have made a commitment to work through this process and to give 
dignity to every person, including veterans.
  But at the same time, would you want to have a situation that 
happened with Dylann Roof, a convicted felon who grabbed a gun in 2 
days and killed nine innocent people, or killed people in various other 
places, from Columbine, to Aurora, to Virginia Tech?",J000032,2019-02-28

the violence in cities where people are getting guns.
  Madam Chair, I would make the argument that, today, we must pass H.R. 
1112. The mercy of all of us dealing with issues to give dignity to 
those who suffer from illnesses that embrace mental illness concerns, 
it was because Mr. Collins, a man of faith, offered that suggestion. 
Therefore, we are going to move forward with the commitment to work it 
through and provide the dignity necessary, but to save the lives and to 
give tribute in death to those who lost their lives at the hands of 
Dylann Roof. Vote for H.R. 1112.
  Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced 
Background Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that would strengthen the 
background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.
  I thank the Majority Whip, Congressman Clyburn, for introducing H.R. 
1112 in response to the atrocity perpetrated at Mother Emmanuel A.M.E. 
Church in Charleston,


South Carolina, which killed nine members of one of the most 
historically significant churches in African American history.
  One June 17, 2015, Dylann Roof was responsible for the mass shooting 
that took the lives of nine individuals at the Emanuel African 
Methodist Episcopal Church.
  The victims were later referred to as ``The Charleston Nine'' and 
``The Emanuel Nine''.
  Under current law, after a prospective buyer completes the 
appropriate form, the holder of a Federal Firearms License initiates 
the background check by phone or computer.
  If a determination is not obtained within three business days then 
the transfer may legally be completed by default proceeding and that is 
how Dylan Roof obtain the handgun he used to commit the killings, which 
he purchased from a retail store in West Columbia, SC.
  H.R 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would 
strengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or 
dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.
  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a 
background check on prospective buyers using the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'').
  Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.
  Under H.R. 1112, if the NICS system has not returned an answer to the 
licensed firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms 
purchaser may file a petition with the Attorney General for review.
  Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms 
dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if 
it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer 
has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from 
obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.
  Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or 
transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days 
have passed since the initial background check, thus closing the so-
called ``Charleston loophole.''
  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
demonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks 
System (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to 
99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within 
90 seconds.
  We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the 
countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue 
to claim so many innocent lives.
  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-
straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.
  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that 
there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more 
than 2015.
  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 
11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.
  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and 
violence deterrence.
  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United State--355 
mass shootings in 2015.
  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School 
in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.
  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, 
with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.
  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large 
crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las 
Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.
  On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist 
Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old 
Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.
  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, 
resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.
  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--
as much as 114 percent higher than other states.
  A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found 
that for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate, 
there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.
  Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such 
as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.
  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.
  This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the 
solution.
  Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the 
wrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons 
used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.
  We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are 
the root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.
  We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues 
that plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite 
plague across the nation.
  My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement 
after four of his officers were shot while on duty.
  He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have 
accomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun 
violence.
  Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long 
overdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
  That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of 
addressing the epidemic.
  Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the 
proposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least 
one life, then it is worth it.
  Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun 
violence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, 
both prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual 
statements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.
  Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the 
question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to 
address a public-health epidemic?''
  I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''
  We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority 
members.
  We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.
  And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President 
and the gun lobby.
  I am a defender and supporter of the constitution.
  I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our 
citizens.
  However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest 
divine right of all.
  I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not 
at the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and 
law enforcement officials.
  Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to 
undergo ``active shooter'' drills.
  Imagine having children in grade school today.
  Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious 
lives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or 
AR-15.
  Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not 
include active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.
  We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to 
pass H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,''",J000032,2019-02-28

may consume.
  Madam Chair, in closing, we have had an interesting debate this 
morning. I think we went back on two points.
  One, I believe I laid out the problems in a very methodical way on 
why this bill has serious defects in it that could possibly be fixed, 
if given long enough to work. I still may disagree with the premise of 
the bill, but it could have been worked out, when you actually take one 
part of law and combine it with another part of law. And we have seen a 
calendaring problem here. That is one part. That is the main part I 
have.
  I think we have also seen how the process has not worked out again. 
Sometimes in life, getting it first is not best. Getting it quickly may 
not always be the best result. I think what we are seeing here is 
something that when we are dealing with the rights of individuals, 
especially in this area here and especially for the reasons that were 
given, which was a tragedy in Charleston that could have been stopped 
by the FBI that already had suspicions on not selling this firearm and 
could have went and taken that firearm, this is just a problem.
  I have laid out as much as I can. I think the speakers have as well. 
There are many opposed to this. They will continue to be opposed to it, 
on both sides of the spectrum, our side from the perspective of our 
rights and those that are being violated, and the ACLU for what their 
reasons may be and others.
  But it is time we had some honest discussion about what can actually 
deter this mass violence that we are seeing. Unfortunately, Madam 
Chair, we always speak of mass violence.
  Why do we always have to go to the big violence? Why do we have to go 
to the ones who were killed that are tragedies that we all see? What 
about the ones that we can actually work on


where we give better enforcement to our law enforcement, better 
prosecution of gun crimes, better prosecution that affects a single 
life in a neighborhood today? Is a single life not as important as the 
ones that we are not affecting now?
  I think as we look forward, I would ask that this, of course, be 
voted down. I think we have laid out a reason why it at least should be 
considered by all Members before they put their card in that machine to 
decide why they are supporting a bill that we believe has some obvious 
flaws to it. It is not the intent of the individual offering it, but 
the actual words on paper have flaws in them. That is why we oppose 
this bill.
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-28
728,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,43,Mr. NADLER,"  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, this is an important bill that addresses a significant, 
and tragically demonstrated, threat to public safety.
  Today is the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the Brady 
Background Check Act. This lifesaving law has served us well, helping 
to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of those who are 
legally prohibited from possessing and purchasing them. But we know 
that some aspects of this law and the system that implements it must be 
updated and improved.
  Let's remember what this bill does. All this bill does is give the 
FBI additional time--gives the NICS system additional time--to complete 
a background check in the 8 or 9 percent of cases where it is not done 
within 90 seconds. If you haven't gotten a background check back in 3 
days, under this bill, you can't get it automatically, and you can't 
get the weapon automatically.
  They have 10 days to do it. If after 10 days they still haven't done 
it, then you can petition the Attorney General. And if they still don't 
do it, get your firearm within 10 days. That will save a lot of lives.
  We hear about mass shootings, but we also should remember that we are 
not talking about just mass shootings. Thirty-four people a day are 
killed in this country by guns--34 a day. Every other industrialized 
country in the world: 90 deaths with guns a year, 120, 170. The United 
States: 39,000.
  How are we different? Are we thousands of times more mentally ill 
than people in Europe or Japan? No.
  Are we more vicious? No.
  Are our habits more degraded? No.
  The difference is that this country is awash in guns. The difference 
is that, in this country, people who are dangerous can get guns.
  These are modest steps. We should take much more advanced steps. We 
should ban assault weapons. We should ban large capacity magazine 
clips. But we are not doing that. We are starting with very moderate 
steps.
  This is a very moderate step to improve the background check system. 
With all the rhetoric we hear, that is all it does. It gives a little 
extra time to make sure that someone who is dangerous, whose possession 
of a firearm is illegal, cannot get it.
  Enacting this bill will save lives. I urge my colleagues to ignore 
all the nonsense rhetoric about extraneous considerations. Join me in 
supporting this bill today. Join me in supporting saving lives. Join me 
in making the United States a little safer to live in.
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.",N000002,2019-02-28
729,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,44,Ms. JOHNSON of Texas,"  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. I rise today to voice my support for H.R. 1112, 
The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019. This bill will strengthen 
our federal gun background check procedures by closing the 
``Charleston'' loophole, thus ensuring that guns can no longer be 
erroneously sold due to incomplete background checks.
  This epidemic of gun violence has left its scars on my home state of 
Texas. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
revealed that there were 3,353 gun-related deaths in Texas in 2017 
alone. Hundreds of these victims are children and teenagers under 19 
years of age.
  Our country has struggled with gun violence for too long, and the 
multitudes of loopholes in our laws are complicit in our difficulties. 
This bill will not only eliminate a significant loophole, but it will 
do so without infringing upon Second Amendment rights. It will ensure 
that only responsible and able individuals are able to purchase guns in 
our country.
  I share our nation's concerns about the widespread proliferation of 
guns in our neighborhoods, and I agree that reasonable restrictions on 
firearms are essential to a comprehensive strategy to reduce crime and 
violence in our society. We must take sensible steps to ensure that 
these firearms do not fall into the wrong hands.
  Furthermore, it has come to my attention that the mental illness 
reference in this bill may be outdated and not in line with current 
medical and legal standards. I will be reviewing this issue as we 
progress through the 116th Congress.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.-",J000126,2019-02-28

736,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,51,Mr. RICE of South Carolina,"  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Chair, Dylann Roof is a monster. 
Dylann Roof should never have been able to buy a gun. Dylann Roof 
walked into a church in my hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, my 
birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, and he slaughtered nine 
people in a Bible study. I can't imagine a more horrific crime. We all, 
naturally, look for a response.
  My friend, Mr. Clyburn, and the majority have noted that thousands of 
people have wrongfully acquired guns because of the failure of our 
background check system under what has become known as the Charleston 
loophole.
  The stated purpose of this underlying legislation, Mr. Clyburn's 
legislation, is certainly noble: to close the Charleston loophole. The 
only problem is that it does not carry out that purpose.
  Too often here, we take up noble causes; we create legislation with 
noble names; we pass this legislation to feel better; but the 
legislation fails to solve the problem in the title.
  After these horrific murders, the families of the victims sued the 
Federal Government for allowing this monster to buy a gun.


  Charleston Federal District Court Judge Gergen wrote a lengthy 
opinion in which he laid bare the Federal background check process and 
its failures in this case, the case of Dylann Roof. His opinion is 
available for anybody to read.
  And in his 22-page opinion, he lays out the various structural flaws 
in the background check system. Most notably, that the FBI maintains 
four criminal databases. And under the background check system, the 
background checker is allowed to check only three of those.
  Why? I assume because those are the three that existed in the 
nineties when the background check came into place.
  There is a fourth one. It is more extensive and it is more detailed. 
It is called N-DEx. In this file was all the information that Dylann 
Roof's background checker needed to know to deny him the right to buy 
the gun. This N-DEx system contained that information, and it is 
maintained by the FBI. All they had to do was allow this background 
checker to look at that. The FBI has admitted had they been able to do 
that, this man--this monster--would never have been able to buy a gun.
  My amendment would actually fix the Charleston loophole. The problem 
is that I cannot support the underlying legislation. Why? Because it 
creates an undue amount of time to be able to buy a gun.
  And number two, the thing that bothers me the most, is that it shifts 
a part of the burden to the American citizen trying to exercise his 
Second Amendment rights. It requires him, in the event that you don't 
hear back from the government, to file a petition with the Federal 
court. I think this is an undue interference with his Second Amendment 
right; therefore, I cannot accept this underlying legislation.
  The Senate has indicated it will not be taken up in the Senate; and 
the President has indicated that, if it passed, he would veto it. 
Therefore, I plan to withdraw my amendment.
  I plan to offer it separately as a new piece of legislation, which 
will, in fact, close the Charleston loophole. It will allow the FBI 
background checkers to search the most current N-DEx file that has all 
this detailed information that was created after 9/11, well after the 
background check law came into effect.
  The FBI has admitted, it would have prevented Dylann Roof from buying 
a gun and, I suspect, many of the other people who have carried out 
these horrific shootings in recent years.
  It will hopefully garner the bipartisan support necessary to actually 
become law and fix the underlying problem.
  Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.",R000597,2019-02-28

1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, and I applaud the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), my good friend, for his 
leadership and enduring commitment to reducing gun violence and making 
our communities safer. I also appreciate my friend from Texas, Sheila 
Jackson Lee, for her leadership on this issue as well.
  Madam Chair, it is unconscionable to think that convicted felons, 
domestic abusers, and others who are prohibited by law from purchasing 
a firearm could end up with these weapons anyway. Sadly, this is the 
reality we currently live in due to the default proceed sales, also 
known as the Charleston loophole.
  I have introduced legislation on this problem in the past because we 
must do everything we can to ensure firearms do not end up in the hands 
of those who should not have them. This is why I am also a cosponsor of 
Mr. Clyburn's Enhanced Background Checks Act.
  The FBI should and, in fact, needs to know if a default proceeds sale 
has taken place. Currently, this is not the case unless the FBI 
eventually completes a background check, determines the purchaser 
should be prohibited from owning a firearm, and subsequently contacts 
the dealer.
  We need more information throughout this process, and my amendment 
would do just that: require the FBI to report on the number of 
background checks that they are not able to complete within the 
designated time period.
  This information will help keep track of the FBI's ability to clear 
background checks in a timely manner as well as give better 
understanding of where there is still room for improvement. It will 
also provide much-needed transparency to the default proceed process.
  All who support commonsense solutions to reduce the gun violence 
epidemic in this country should support this amendment and the 
underlying legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Jackson Lee), my dear friend and a tireless champion and leader on the 
efforts to reduce gun violence.",S001190,2019-02-28
744,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,59,Ms. JACKSON LEE,"  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman very much, and I 
thank him for his leadership on a very


important enhancement to the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, 
which requires the FBI to report on the number of petitions it was not 
able to make a determination on within the 10-day period.
  I think Mr. Schneider knows that why we are here on the floor is to 
save lives, to be able to protect innocent people from being subjected 
to what the Emanuel Nine were: worshippers in a church with their 
pastor, praying, as this country allows one to do.
  It is my belief that the Schneider-Jackson Lee amendment should be 
passed, because with this critical data and compliance reporting we can 
learn more about legislative injustices like the one that enabled 
Dylann Roof to process a handgun used to murder the nine innocent 
persons at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and 
to remind everybody he had not been approved by the NICS reporting 
system, and he was able to come back. This system allows us to know how 
many have not been approved, to be able to address the question, to 
have better policies dealing with protecting gun violence.
  It is my privilege to join my colleague in supporting the Schneider-
Jackson Lee amendment.
  Madam Chair, I close by saying that this tracks the Accidental 
Firearms Transfer Reporting Act that I introduced in previous 
Congresses in H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57.
  I look forward to working with my colleague as we expand reasonable 
gun safety legislation to protect our children, our families, and 
Americans.
  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment which I am 
proud to cosponsor with the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Brad 
Schneider.
  I thank the Rules Committee for making the Schneider/Jackson Lee 
Amendment in order and thank the Majority Whip for introducing the 
underlying legislation, H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act 
of 2019.''
  H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would 
strengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or 
dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.
  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a 
background check on prospective buyers using the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'').
  Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.
  If the NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed 
firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may 
file a petition with the Attorney General for review.
  Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms 
dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if 
it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer 
has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from 
obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.
  Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or 
transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days 
have passed since the initial background check.
  The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment strengthens the bill by requiring 
the FBI to report on the number of petitions on which it was not able 
to make a determination regarding the eligibility of the transferee to 
possess a firearm within the 10-day period allotted by H.R. 1112.
  I urge my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment 
because, with this critical data and compliance reporting, we can learn 
more about legislative interstices like the one that enabled Dylan Roof 
to possess the handgun used to murder 9 innocent persons at Mother 
Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the 
numerous other cases where a firearm was handed over to an unintended 
and potentially dangerous recipient.
  Making sure that policy makers have the most accurate, reliable, and 
current data regarding background checks is one of the main reasons I 
introduced the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act in the 114th 
and 115th Congress (H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57 respectively).
  Madam Chair, if anything, it is gun violence that is a national 
emergency, and reducing gun violence should be one of Congress's 
highest priorities.
  The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment will help to do that.
  I ask my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment in 
order.
  Again, I thank Majority Whip Clyburn for introducing the underlying 
legislation and Congressman Schneider for his work on this salutary 
amendment.
  I urge all Members to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment.

761,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,76,Mr. LEVIN of Michigan,"  Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Chairwoman, I am proud to cosponsor the 
Enhanced Background Checks Act, H.R. 1112, and I am also proud today to 
present an amendment that will make sure we can track and learn from 
the good that this bill will accomplish once it becomes law.
  In 2017, 39,773 Americans died from gun violence. This is a public 
health epidemic.
  Under current law, if a background check is not completed within 3 
business days, a federally licensed firearm dealer may move forward 
with a firearms transfer or sale.
  The devastating reality is that many horrific acts of gun violence, 
including the massacre of the Emanuel Methodist Church in Charleston, 
South Carolina, which ended nine lives and left several people wounded, 
could have been avoided.
  Today, we will vote to close the loophole that allowed for that 
tragedy by closing what has become known as the Charleston loophole. 
The Enhanced Background Checks Act will provide the background check 
system with additional time to make a final determination on a 
potential firearm purchaser before a licensed dealer can transfer a 
gun.
  We have an obligation to the American people and to the victims of 
the shooter at the AME church to pass the bill before us today, and I 
am proud to be part of this effort to protect our communities from gun 
violence.
  My amendment to H.R. 1112 will require the Government Accountability 
Office to submit a report to Congress 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years 
following the implementation of this law. These reports will analyze 
the extent to which the changes made by this law will prevent firearms 
from being transferred to prohibited persons.
  I am proud that this amendment has broad support from all 
stakeholders that have been involved in making this bill a reality.
  We must strive for effective, evidence-based policies that promote 
public health and protect our communities. My amendment will cost us 
nothing, but it will help build the evidence base around the 
effectiveness of good gun violence prevention policies like this one.
  This amendment is all the more important, given the regrettable lack 
of Federal funding for gun violence research. My amendment will finally 
help us demonstrate with data that gun violence prevention measures 
like the one before us today will prevent firearms from ending up in 
the hands of people who should not have them.
  I came to Washington because the people of southern Macomb and 
southeastern Oakland Counties sent me here on a mission, and that 
mission includes protecting our communities from senseless gun 
violence.
  I stand today in solidarity with the courageous people of Michigan's 
Ninth Congressional District's Moms Demand Action and Students Demand 
Action.
  We have a responsibility as Members of Congress and as human beings 
not just to talk about the horrors of gun violence, but to do 
everything in our powers to end it. Today, we will take the critically 
necessary step to do just that.
  I would like to thank Congressman  Jim Clyburn, Peter King, and Joe 
Cunningham for their leadership to ensure that we close the Charleston 
loophole. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1112 and support this 
amendment.
  Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Nadler), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

  I support this amendment to require the GAO to submit a report to the 
relevant congressional committees analyzing the extent to which the 
additions required by this bill prevent firearms from being transferred 
to prohibited persons.
  It will be important for us to get information about the 
implementation of the law and its impact on so-called default proceed 
transactions. The amendment also requires that the GAO report its 
findings after 90 days and again after 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.

legislation and see how effective it is.

  Madam Chair, when we discuss the epidemic of gun violence in our 
country, we must confront the issues of domestic violence, domestic 
abuse, dating partner violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
  According to the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic 
Violence, firearms pose a significant danger to victims of domestic 
violence, and this is true no matter who owns the firearm. Research 
shows that a male abuser's access to a firearm increases the risk of 
intimate partner femicide fivefold and does not support the contention 
that firearm possession is a protective factor for the victim.
  The fact is, prohibited buyers who obtain a firearm through the 
Charleston loophole are disproportionately likely to be prohibited 
because of domestic violence. Indeed, in 2017, 23 percent of cases 
where a gun was transferred to a prohibited purchaser through a default 
proceed sale involved a person prohibited due to a conviction for 
domestic violence, or prohibited due to a domestic violence restraining 
order.
  Denials related to domestic violence often require more investigation 
than denials based on other factors.
  I am offering this amendment so that this bill's background check 
process, before it goes into effect, Congress can hear from experts in 
the Justice Department and at the National Resource Center on Domestic 
Violence and Firearms on whether any changes could be made to better 
protect victims of domestic violence.
  This amendment requires the study on domestic violence to be 
completed within 150 days. If the Van Drew amendment passes, this bill 
will have an effective date of 210 days after enactment.
  If the study finds that further changes would be advisable to better 
protect domestic violence victims, Congress will have enough time to 
make those changes.
  Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. 
Moore).",P000618,2019-02-28
774,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,89,Ms. MOORE,"  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, let me thank the gentlewoman for offering 
this amendment, along with our other colleagues, to H.R. 1112 that 
would simply require the Department of Justice to release a report 
analyzing the effect of this bill's provisions on the safety of the 
victims of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence, 
sexual assault, and stalking.
  Madam Chairwoman, I am here on the floor today with the hopes that my 
colleagues will listen to the 10 million men, women, and children who 
experience domestic violence each year. Domestic violence is a horrible 
scourge, and the presence or possession of a gun only worsens these 
tragedies.
  You heard my colleague, Representative Porter, say that women are 
five times more likely to die or be killed in a domestic violence 
situation if a gun is owned, which is one of the reasons, Madam Chair, 
I have introduced legislation to help incentivize States to adopt laws 
that ensure that we do everything to take guns from those with a court 
restraining order or other protective order.
  I hope, Madam Chair, that my colleagues will listen to the one in 
three women and one in four men who have been victims of intimate 
partner violence. I sure hope that my colleagues will listen to me as 
one of the 4.5 million women who have experienced gun violence 
firsthand.
  There is much discussion in these Chambers about a national 
emergency. Gun violence and domestic violence are a national emergency, 
and that is why we have offered this amendment so that our laws 
actually reflect the realities.
  The data collected will be critical to inform Congress about ways to 
prevent needless tragedies in our country, and to help us evolve in a 
way that will more accurately protect our constituents.",M001160,2019-02-28

785,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,100,Mr. VAN DREW,"  Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  My amendment will ensure that from the date a firearm purchase is 
legally authorized under the bill, the firearm purchaser has 25 
calendar days to pick up their gun, regardless of how much time has 
elapsed since the background check was first initiated.
  This would prevent a situation under the bill as it is written that, 
although rare, would still be possible, where the maximum allowable 
number of business days, 20 business days, that a purchaser would have 
to wait for an approval could actually run longer, hypothetically, than 
the 30 days.
  That would be problematic because under a current ATF, Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulation, a gun cannot be 
transferred after 30 days once a background check begins.
  Where more than 30 calendar days have passed since the licensee first 
contacted NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, 
the licensee must initiate a new NICS check prior to transferring the 
firearm. My amendment would prevent an unnecessary background check do-
over.
  For those who get approved by the FBI after 3 business days, my 
amendment would essentially nullify the 30


days ATF regulation, allowing prospective firearm owners the peace of 
mind that they do deserve.
  After this bill went through the Judiciary Committee, the point was 
raised that an existing ATF regulation, if left unchanged, could result 
in a situation where even after a background check was approved or a 
petition process was followed, the lawful gun buyer would still not be 
able to get the gun without doing a second background check because too 
much time had elapsed since the first background check began.
  This is clearly not the intent of the bill, and while I believe that 
ATF would amend the regulation if this bill is passed, this amendment 
removes all doubt. Anyone who is legally authorized to obtain a firearm 
under the new process will have ample time, 25 days, to return to the 
dealer and retrieve the gun.

fix it--I think that is the problem that we are looking at--as written. 
As we discussed earlier, your amendment claims to prevent this endless 
loop, but it fails to do so.
  Per ATF regulation, a NICS check is only valid for 30 calendar days 
from when the NICS is initially contacted. This language does not 
extend the timeframe in the event of a delayed response, nor does it 
direct the attorney general to do so.
  So if the purchaser completes the three-step process under H.R. 1112, 
then attempts to take possession of the firearm on calendar day 31, ATF 
regulations would suggest it is too late. The NICS check has expired, 
and as a result, the federally licensed firearms dealer would need to 
conduct a new NICS check while restarting the process.
  Madam Chair, I did offer an amendment to extend the validity of the 
NICS check to 60 days to cure this deficiency, however, the Democrats 
refused to make my amendment in order. For that reason, I am glad that 
the gentleman is trying to fix this, which is where it should be, but 
it just doesn't fix it.
  So we are again searching for an amendment and solution to a problem 
that could have been fixed, but this amendment does not fix it. I am 
glad the gentleman brought the amendment and in the plain reading of 
the statute and the plain reading of this amendment, this is a great 
attempt. It just falls short.
  For that reason, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this 
amendment because it does not actually fix the problem we outlined 
earlier.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-28

this is 25 days after the approval, and also that law supersedes 
regulation. There is no question that that 25 days would be in place 
and that would give more than a sufficient amount of time, in fact, a 
lenient amount of time, just to ensure that there aren't any problems 
here.
  Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Nadler), the chairman, to speak in favor of this amendment.",V000133,2019-02-28
790,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,105,Mr. NADLER,"  Mr. NADLER. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I rise in support of this amendment, and this completely takes care 
of Mr. Collins' concern, whether he realizes it or not. Because this 
says that the transfer can take place for 25 days after the transfer 
becomes legally permissible.
  In other words, under the longest timeframe, the background check 
doesn't come back within 10 days. The purchaser waits a few days, and 
then petitions the attorney general. It takes another 10 days. Then it 
becomes legally permissible.
  This says the transfer can take place for 25 days after that. So 
there is no way that this doesn't take care of the problem that Mr. 
Collins raised, and then some.
  The current procedures in place do not take into account the longer 
waiting period in the petition process that H.R. 1112 requires. This 
amendment more than takes care of that. It is a salutary amendment. It 
makes the system work, and I can't understand anybody, whether they 
support the bill or not, who wouldn't want to support this, so I 
support the amendment.",N000002,2019-02-28

of other points, on a personal level, I have always been a supporter of 
Second Amendment rights and continue to be. The purpose of this 
amendment is to, obviously, do so, support Second Amendment rights.


  Secondly, I know that there is language in another part of the bill 
that many people have asked me about which is not something that I am 
amending or had to do with, but I know that there is a commitment from 
leadership that that language is going to be completely redone and that 
language will be totally appropriate and actually will be a major 
improvement.

disagree, because there is still the 30-day limitation. The 30-day 
limitation is not done here, and so there is and could be a problem if 
it was done. I still have my time, and there is no time remaining.
  The issue here is that if it is approved after the 30 days, then this 
bill does not fix it. The easy fix here was an amendment we offered 
that simply extended it for 60 days. That is your fix. Instead, we go 
through this where there can be, as all good things lawyerly, we can 
have lawyerly disagreements. I think in the end, when you actually go 
back and look at this, you will see that there is an interpretation 
problem here. The 30 days still exists.
  Why could we have not just simply extended the NICS date for 60 days 
instead of 30 days instead of going through this exercise of legal 
interpretation?

812,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,127,Mrs. LESKO,"  Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, this motion to recommit will not kill the 
bill or send it back to committee, to be clear. If adopted, the bill 
will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.
  My Democratic colleagues are set to pass this bill despite the fact 
that the ACLU opposes it.
  Let me repeat that. The ACLU opposes H.R. 1112 because it is so 
sweeping and improperly perpetrates unfounded assumptions that people 
with mental disabilities should be considered dangerous and are prone 
to violence without any meaningful due process.
  As most of you know, I am a survivor of domestic violence, and that 
is why this motion to recommit is so personally important to me. This 
motion to recommit, in contrast, is narrowly tailored. It would simply 
allow victims of domestic violence who go through a NICS check to 
receive their firearms in 3 days, which is the status quo, if NICS has 
not responded with a denial or approval in 3 business days--again, the 
status quo.
  Do we really want to tell victims of domestic violence they have to 
wait up to 20 business days, which is under this bill, before they are 
allowed to adequately defend themselves?
  Do we really want to tell them: Sorry. I know you are purchasing a 
firearm to protect yourself, but you have to wait 20 business days?
  Should we tell them: Hopefully you can hide from your abuser for the 
next month?
  The Judiciary Committee recently heard testimony from a young woman 
who was raped on her college campus. She did not have a gun on campus 
because the State did not allow her to carry a gun in order to defend 
herself. This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens, not 
criminals, follow the law and how this law-abiding young woman was 
harmed by gun control laws.
  Another specific example related to this bill of a well-intentioned 
law gone wrong is Carol Bowne, a New Jersey woman stabbed to death 
while waiting to be approved for her firearm application. She already 
had an order of protection from the courts, but that wasn't enough for 
her. She needed more than just that piece of paper. She needed to 
protect herself, so she went and tried to get a gun to defend herself, 
but because of the waiting period, she was killed.
  Let me repeat that. Carol Bowne had an order of protection. She 
attempted to purchase a firearm, and she was tragically murdered by her 
abuser while waiting to be approved.
  H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the 
country, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger. 
Women who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a 
month, like Carol.
  How many women will potentially suffer like Carol? And what will the 
Democrats say: Sorry; we hope you can hide from your abuser for a 
month?
  Madam Speaker, that would be foolish as well as heartless. It would 
be an infringement of Second Amendment rights for someone who needs 
them the most.
  Given the insidious flaws in this bill, do we really want to burden 
law-abiding victims by placing them in a never-ending cycle of 
background checks? Of course not.
  This motion to recommit is a commonsense measure. It would ensure 
that domestic violence victims, many of whom live in fear, can receive 
the protection they need and deserve.
  Vote for this motion to recommit and you vote to protect domestic 
violence victims. Vote against the motion to recommit and you are 
telling victims who live in fear: Sorry; we won't help you.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to 
recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.

815,ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2277,130,Mrs. DINGELL,"  Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, the underlying bill, H.R. 1112, is a 
critical and carefully crafted bill to address the Charleston loophole.
  We have discussed it here today, but I will repeat, the very name 
``Charleston loophole'' is a grim reminder of the deficiency in current 
law that allows killers to get guns even if a firearms background check 
has not been completed. This is a dangerous flaw that we can address 
with a minor change to the system.
  When a background check cannot be completed within a 3-day period, it 
is important that the FBI work to resolve the unanswered questions 
presented, because these are the very cases that present the most 
danger.
  Unfortunately, we have seen many default proceeds go forward in 
domestic violence cases, allowing an abuser to obtain a firearm even 
when he or she is prohibited from owning one. The statistics back that 
up.
  In 2013 and 2014, a plurality of default proceed transfers to 
prohibit a person were related to domestic violence. In that same 
period, 30 percent of denials due to convictions for misdemeanor 
domestic violence were issued after the abuser took possession of the 
gun.
  My heart goes out to my colleague, Mrs. Lesko, because she should 
never have suffered from domestic violence. Unfortunately, we are 
colleagues that both know it.
  I have spent more time thinking about how you keep guns out of the 
hands of abusers, probably, than anybody in this Chamber. I know better 
than most the dangers they pose.
  It is not easy for me to talk about it this week, but more than 
once--and I think of the abuser. I will be honest on this floor. My 
father was mentally ill. I had to hide in that closet with my siblings 
wondering if we would live or die. One night, I kept my father from 
killing my mother. He shouldn't have had a gun.
  This is what I remember as a child. My mother went out and bought a 
gun, and then all of us were scared to death about her gun and my 
father's gun. We had two guns to worry about.
  No child, no woman, no man should ever have to go through that.

  The additional time provided by H.R. 1112 will help us stop more 
massacres such as the one in Charleston, and may it prevent another 
child or family going through what I did as a child.
  These amendments made by this motion would undermine the lifesaving 
improvements to current law that this bill will initiate. I oppose this 
motion with every bit of my heart and soul and urge my colleagues to do 
the same.

  They hid under his desk in the basement of Emanuel AME Church while a 
demented gentleman who wanted to start a race war, was welcomed into 
their Bible study--at the end of that hour, Reverend Clementa asked all 
of the worshippers to bow their heads and close their eyes as he prayed 
for what had occurred that evening. While their heads were bowed and 
their eyes closed, Dylann Roof opened his, after having been welcomed 
into their midst, and he slaughtered Reverend Pinckney and his eight 
worshippers.
  Why? Because he was allowed to get this gun when he was not eligible 
to get one. They found out on the fifth day that he was ineligible but, 
by that point, it was too late. As a result, those poor souls lost 
their lives.

829,"RECOGNIZING TWO MAINE CONSTITUENTS, DR. MICHAEL TAYLOR AND WENDY TAYLOR",CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE228,0,Ms. PINGREE,"  Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize two of my Maine 
constituents, Dr. Michael Taylor and Wendy Taylor, whose shared vision, 
determination, and commitment have changed and saved lives in Northern 
Haiti and engaged countless Mainers in support of better health and 
better lives.
  Over seventy years ago, the founding documents of the World Health 
Association proclaimed that ``The enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human 
being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic 
or social condition.''
  Michael and Wendy Taylor have long believed in this right, and they 
recognized the extraordinary need in Haiti. In establishing Konbit 
Sante in 2001, they committed to supporting the development of an 
improved health care system to meet the needs of the Cap Haitien 
community. Their vision was to ensure maximum local direction and 
partnerships within the existing system rather than the creation of a 
parallel system. And they knew that it was important to not just 
improve access to health care, but to improve the quality of that care.
  The beauty of this effort has been in the Konbit--which, in Haitian 
Creole, loosely translates to working together for a common goal. 
Rather than providing short-term expertise, Konbit Sante's focus has 
been on strengthening infrastructure, enhancing training, and ensuring 
necessary resources. Right from the start, the Taylors recognized that 
real, sustainable improvements in an under-resourced health system 
required taking the long view. This has not been fast nor always easy, 
but this capacity building model--trusting and supporting Haitians to 
serve Haitians--has yielded extraordinary results.
  Michael and Wendy have had successful careers, raised children, 
enjoyed art and music, nurtured deep and enduring friendships, and 
travelled the world--always coming back to coastal Maine. Along the way 
they have invested their time, talents, and resources in doing good, 
making lasting contributions for the betterment of humankind and 
inspiring so many others to join them.
  Dr. Taylor is receiving the 2019 Presidential Citation today from the 
American Academy of Dermatologists in recognition of his extraordinary 
contributions to the people of Haiti. His wife and Konbit Sante 
cofounder, Wendy, will be at his side. I want to congratulate them 
both, as they make me proud to represent the good people of Maine.

community, whether they are at work, at home, at school, or at church.
  Less than 2 weeks ago, five people, four of whom were my 
constituents, left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt Company in 
Aurora, Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken by a 
horrific act of gun violence. I am committed to honoring the lives of 
victims of gun violence through action.
  H.R. 1112 is a commonsense and bipartisan bill that will help address 
a deficiency in background check laws by allowing law enforcement to 
conduct a thorough background check. I am proud to cosponsor an 
amendment that will help ensure this legislation improves the safety of 
victims of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence, 
sexual assault, and stalking.
  Yesterday was the first time in more than two decades that the U.S. 
House of Representatives passed a major gun safety bill, and today we 
have an opportunity to take a further step. H.R. 1112 will help save 
innocent lives, and I look forward to working on commonsense 
legislation that balances protecting our gun rights and ensuring the 
safety of our community.

831,EGYPT,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1585,0,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss the situation in 
Egypt, a country where unchecked repression has come to define the 
government of President el-Sisi.
  The 2011 Egyptian revolution brought hope of a democratic future for 
the country, but it has failed to materialize, subverted by aspiring 
autocrats. After winning historic democratic elections in 2012, the 
Morsi government sought to consolidate its control, issuing a 
declaration to provide the President with sweeping authorities and 
eliminating checks on Executive power. The response was another popular 
uprising and a military coup led by then-Defense Minister Abdel Fattah 
el-Sisi.
  Although cheered by some who favor President el-Sisi's crackdown on 
the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and anyone suspected of being 
affiliated with it, his Presidency has become a model for autocratic 
rule. His police have arrested human rights lawyers, journalists, civil 
society activists, and opposition politicians. Anyone who criticizes 
the regime or calls for a more democratic system is threatened, 
arrested, and accused of ``terrorism'' or some other vague crime 
against the state. Once detained, they have been subjected to physical 
and psychological abuse while they wait for months or more often years 
before being subjected to sham trials that make a mockery of due 
process.
  Earlier this month, President el-Sisi's government took another step 
to consolidate his rule. Egypt's rubberstamp Parliament approved 
constitutional amendments that would enable el-Sisi to remain in power 
until 2034, 12 years beyond the end of his second and final term. Other 
amendments would enable el-Sisi to tighten his control of the 
judiciary, create a second Parliamentary chamber dominated by 
Presidential appointees, and expand the authority of the military to 
codify its role in civilian political life. Egypt today is a civilian 
government in name only. The military, led by el-Sisi, effectively 
wields total control.
  In 2011, we all hoped the Egyptian people had a brighter, albeit 
challenging, political future ahead of them, but 7 years after the 
overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the el-Sisi government is erasing any 
remaining hope for democracy in the country. The calls of those who 
flooded the streets under Mubarak and Morsi for greater political 
freedom and civil liberties, less corruption, and more accountability 
are treated not as visions for Egypt's future, but as threats to el-
Sisi himself.
  Regrettably, it seems that the only constant in U.S.-Egyptian 
relations over the last several decades, besides Egyptian Government 
repression and billions of dollars in U.S. military aid, is the 
reticence with which successive U.S. administrations have confronted 
this issue. There always seems to be an excuse for why now is not the 
time to insist on meaningful progress to advance democracy and human 
rights by our ally Egypt. If not now, when? What line would the 
Egyptian government have to cross for the Congress and the 
administration to recognize the threat that a brutal military 
dictatorship poses to stability in Egypt, and to our long-term 
interests in the region?
  Every U.S. administration has engaged, in varying degrees, in quiet 
diplomacy to address human rights abuses and corruption overseas and 
issued public statements or withheld foreign aid to encourage progress. 
Diplomacy, if backed up with consequences, can achieve results, but 
successive Egyptian Governments have gambled that, at the end of the 
day, we will look the other way in the mistaken belief that doing so 
serves U.S. security interests, and by and large, that has been the 
case.
  It is interesting to compare the Trump administration's selective 
condemnation of government repression in other countries, where the 
number of political prisoners is a fraction of those in Egypt, to 
President Trump's pronouncement that President el-Sisi as a ``great 
guy.'' What a sad commentary on what this country purports to stand 
for.
  We must acknowledge what history has repeatedly shown, that upholding 
our values is the best way to protect our interests. That does not mean 
cutting off all aid and walking away from Egypt. That kind of 
reactionary approach is equally short-sighted. What it does mean is 
that we need a more principled, measured, and consistent policy and 
make clear that our aid is not a blank check--that Egypt's leaders are 
not above the law; that freedom of expression is universal; that due 
process is a right; that torture, cruel and inhuman treatment are 
forbidden under international law; and that governments should be 
accountable to their people.
  At a time when President el-Sisi is seeking to manipulate the 
legislative process to cement his hold on power for life, senior 
officials at the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon 
need to stand up for what is first and foremost in our national 
interest: the principles that define us as Americans.
  I hope all Senators will join me in encouraging the Trump 
administration to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors and 
realign our policy toward Egypt with our values.

832,OPPOSING EXTREME PRIORITIES,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2276-2,0,Mr. ALLEN,"  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise here this morning to speak out 
against the extreme priorities of our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle. With so many pressing issues facing the 116th Congress, I 
find it appalling that H.R. 1 has been reserved for legislation that 
completely undermines the democratic framework of our country.
  Simply put, this bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled power grab 
through more government, more regulation, and political speech 
repression. To call this legislation the For the People Act is 
borderline ludicrous.
  H.R. 1 would eliminate States' authority to set voting 
qualifications, restore voting rights of convicted felons even if it 
contradicts State or local policy, outlaw voter verification, and force 
taxpayers to subsidize anonymous donations even if it is for a 
candidate they do not support.
  This is just the tip of the iceberg. H.R. 1 is not for the people 
but, rather, an attempt to expand power to Federal bureaucrats and 
unelected Federal judges, undercutting the will of everyday citizens 
and the Constitution.
  This is not reform. This is a shameless attempt to keep one party in 
power, and the American people deserve better.

834,SITES RESERVOIR PROJECT ACT,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE229,0,Mr. GARAMENDI,"  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I introduce the ``Sites Reservoir 
Project Act,'' which would provide federal support for the 1.8 million 
acre-feet Sites Reservoir and related water infrastructure in Colusa 
and Glenn Counties.
  Specifically, the ``Sites Reservoir Project Act'' would direct the 
Bureau of Reclamation to complete the feasibility study for the project 
and, if deemed feasible, authorize federal funding and technical 
support for its construction. The reservoir would be owned and operated 
by the Sites Joint Powers Authority, a regional consortium of local 
water agencies and counties formed in 2010.
  Our state must make forward-looking investments to capture and store 
water during wet years for use during drought. The Sites Reservoir is 
one such critical infrastructure project needed to meet California's 
future water needs, given climate change. The project is essential to 
integrated water management in the Sacramento Valley and would maximize 
storage of excess Sacramento River flows during winter storms for use 
later in the year. The Sites Reservoir Project would increase storage 
capacity north of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, improving 
resiliency in our statewide water system, and helping to advance 
California's renewable energy goals with the pumped-storage component 
planned for phase II of the project.
  To date, more than $1.2 billion in public funding has been committed 
to the Sites Reservoir Project, including $816 million from 
California's State Water Bond (2014 Proposition 1) and federal funding 
from the Bureau of Reclamation for the feasibility study and related 
work. In November 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture committed 
$449 million in low-interest financing from the Rural Development 
Program, recognizing the project's importance to California's farming 
communities.
  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and northern California neighbor 
Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) for his support as the bill's original 
cosponsor and for sponsoring similar legislation in previous 
Congresses.
  I look forward to working with all members of the California 
delegation to advance this bipartisan bill and see this critical 
reservoir project completed.

836,STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2299,1,Ms. NORTON,"  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, this week was, for all intents and 
purposes, D.C. Statehood Week in the Capital. I am pleased that, today, 
Senator Carper has announced that he is introducing the Washington, 
D.C. Admission Act to make the District of Columbia the 51st State. I 
am grateful to Senator Carper, who garnered a record number of Senate 
cosponsors last year and has been a most vigorous champion of statehood 
for the District of Columbia.
  I come to the floor for my first time this session to discuss D.C. 
statehood because we have many new Members who may be under the 
mistaken impression that the 700,000 people who live in your Nation's 
Capital are treated in the same rights that your own residents are. I 
beg to differ.
  In this city, the citizens do not have each and every right in this 
Congress. To be sure, we have what is called home rule, and I will 
later indicate that even that is limited.
  The reasons for this unique place, for our Capital, left without the 
full rights of other citizens, has to do with a quirk, an accident, 
where the Framers came to believe that the Capital should not be part 
of a State because they were, in the beginning, parts of various 
States, and they felt that they could not then control what the Capital 
would do.
  Well, of course, they don't want a Capital to be part of a State, but 
they didn't really envision statehood, the Capital as a State, because 
they were thinking of the Thirteen Colonies. And since every city had 
to be in a State, they could only envision putting the city in a State.
  We are about 218 years beyond that, and it is time, way past time--
shall I say, overdue in time--to understand how the Nation's Capital of 
the greatest nation in the world should be viewed and what rights its 
citizens should have.
  So I am very grateful to Senator Carper for the work he has done and 
for his introduction of the bill in the Senate this week, the 
counterpart of the D.C. statehood bill, which I have already introduced 
in the House.
  The bill I have introduced already has 198 cosponsors. I bet--I 
haven't looked closely, but there is probably no bill in the hopper 
that has more cosponsors than the D.C. statehood bill. It is not 
bipartisan yet. That will happen, because this is how we make progress 
on matters in the House of Representatives. We go one House at a time.
  Remember, the District doesn't have any representation in the Senate; 
yet we have gotten a distinguished Senator introducing the statehood 
bill, and he has been most energetic, getting the majority of the 
Democratic Senators on the bill last session.
  I am particularly moved today because of the record number of D.C. 
residents and their colleagues who came to the Congress yesterday to 
demand that they have equal rights with all other American citizens. I 
greeted a room full of residents who had visited every office to tell 
Members what they don't know.
  I am grateful particularly that the Speaker of the House, Nancy 
Pelosi, has strongly endorsed D.C. statehood. I believe that means that 
D.C. statehood will be on the floor this session. I want to thank our 
Speaker for making D.C. statehood a priority, and indicating in her own 
words how important it is that every citizen be treated equally.
  In the same way, Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah 
Cummings has committed to holding a hearing on D.C. statehood, and I 
will predict this afternoon on the floor that that bill will get out of 
committee and come to the floor of the House for a vote.


  The progress we are making on D.C. statehood is also seen in the 
inclusion of our statehood demands in what is called H.R. 1. That is an 
all-democracy bill that tries to improve and make sure that full 
democracy in every form is present in the United States. In H.R. 1 are 
extensive findings for D.C. statehood.
  I thank the Democratic majority for including the District of 
Columbia and its plea for statehood in this all important pro-democracy 
bill. It is called the For the People Act, and H.R. 1 was the first 
bill introduced.
  Most Members who come to the Congress come knowing only that the 
Nation's Capital is where all these wonderful memorial buildings are. 
They know that it is a tourist mecca. Many may have come as children or 
even as adults, as tourists. They probably don't know that 30 million 
visitors from all over the world visit our Nation's Capital.
  In other words, most Members of the House who, by the way, will spend 
more time in the District of Columbia than they will spend at home, 
still don't know very much about their own Capital City. They probably 
don't know that only in America does the legislature not grant full 
representation to their Capital City.
  Well, I have just voted on the House floor. I vote on amendments, but 
I did not vote on the final bill. I do vote in what is called the 
Committee of the Whole. The reason I am able to vote there is that, 
when I first came to Congress in 1991, I saw that I could, indeed, vote 
in committee, and I knew there was something called the Committee of 
the Whole.
  Well, what is the difference between voting in committee, like the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, for example, where I have 
always served and voted, what is the difference between that and the 
Committee of the Whole? No difference.


  Both are committees that were created by the Congress, not the 
Constitution.
  So, since I vote in committee, I asked for the right to vote in the 
Committee of the Whole. It was granted.
  But only in America, again, could the following happen: my Republican 
friends sued the House for allowing the vote in the Committee of the 
Whole.
  The courts looked at that, pronounced the right of the Congress to 
give that vote in the Committee of the Whole, just as the District has 
the vote in committee, and my Republican friends then appealed.
  At the Court of Appeals, the verdict was, yes, the District of 
Columbia can vote in the Committee of the Whole, just as they vote in 
committee.
  And my good Republican friends didn't quite have the nerve to appeal 
that one to the Supreme Court, but what they did do, when Democrats 
lost the House 2 years later, was to take away a vote, that the courts 
had said was legitimate, from the residents of the District of 
Columbia, who are number one per capita in taxes paid to support the 
government of the United States. And therein lies the outrageous 
anomaly.
  Those who pay the most taxes per capita have the least rights. That 
is why we are determined to get our rights.
  Yes, I have just voted on two gun safety amendments that were on this 
floor today. I couldn't vote on the final bill, but I could vote on 
those amendments. They were important amendments relating to background 
checks.
  By the way, something like 97 percent of the American people in one 
poll were shown to favor background checks. That means you check to see 
if a person has a criminal background and shouldn't have a gun. What is 
the controversy in that one?
  So I was able to vote on those two amendments.
  This is all by way of self-help, thinking through what is it I can do 
to make sure the people I represent have the maximum of representation 
they can. I sure am not crying about what I cannot do, when you 
consider what I can do.
  I am chair of the most important subcommittee now in the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Through that committee, I 
have been able to rebuild whole parts of the District of Columbia: The 
Wharf, the Southwest Waterfront as it is called; the southeast 
waterfront, Capitol Riverfront; parts of Washington, like NoMa.
  I have been able to do a great deal. That is not the issue.
  The issue is equal. Not equal for me personally; equal for those I 
represent, who have paid their dues without getting their rights.
  When I say, ``pay their dues,'' I want to elaborate on that. The city 
I represent has one of the strongest economies in the Nation. It has a 
budget of about $14 billion. That is larger than the budget of 12 
States. Many States are crying poor, trying to tax or not tax their 
residents, embroiled in that controversy.
  The city I represent has a $2 billion surplus. Its per capita income, 
the per capita income of the Americans who live in your Capital City, 
is higher than that of any State.
  Now, we are about the equivalent in size of seven states. Our per 
capita income, though, is higher than that of any State. Take your 
biggest States, Texas and New York and California: higher per capita 
income. That tells you about how much economic activity there is in 
your Nation's capital.
  This city, which is something of a city state, has residents whose 
personal income is higher than that of seven States; we do not cry 
poor.
  Our population growth is among the highest in the Nation. People want 
to live in your Nation's capital. It is one of the most pleasant, 
livable cities in our country.
  What do they pay per capita in taxes? $12,000 per resident in taxes 
to support a government that does not give them equal rights.
  Our Armed Forces--Armed Forces with representatives from every State, 
it should be known--has always had residents of the District of 
Columbia who fought and died in every war, including the war that 
created the United States, the Revolutionary War. You, of course, are 
aware of that war, the war that was fought for taxation without 
representation. No wonder District residents are demanding that our 
Congress live up to that great slogan and standard.
  Now, as I indicated, it is not as if we don't have any rights. The 
Congress passed the Home Rule Act in 1974--I will speak later about the 
deficiencies of the Home Rule Act--but that means that the city does 
have its own elected mayor and its own elected legislature, its 
council.
  How did we get that? Well, first of all, it took over 100 years after 
the Civil War. The first home rule was given to the Capital City by 
Republicans in the 19th century who had fought and won the Civil War, 
where those in my party the Democrats had fought on the side of 
slavery.
  Republicans fought on the side of freedom, and when it saw it had a 
capital that did not have freedom, it gave the District home rule.
  Now, the Republicans had rather much lost their way, as the Democrats 
certainly had, for more than 100 years, but when Richard Nixon was 
President of the United States, the Home Rule Act was passed.
  I would just like to read a few of his words. He said, in signing the 
bill: ``As a longtime supporter of self-government for the District of 
Columbia, I am pleased to sign into law a measure which is of historic 
significance for the citizens of our Nation's Capital.''
  He went on to say: ``I,'' that is Richard Nixon, now, ``first voted 
for home rule as a Member of the House of Representatives in 1948, and 
I have endorsed the enactment of home rule legislation during both my 
terms as President.''
  This was bipartisan, finally. And Republicans, that party, that post-
war party, post-World War II party, deserves credit for understanding 
that the time had come for the Capital City to have home rule.
  That home rule was not complete, in the sense that, and most 
importantly, the District budget has to come here, and it becomes a 
foil on which to press amendments to overturn laws that people may not 
like.

  I have been able to defeat most of those riders, as we call them, or 
attempts to take down D.C. laws, but the D.C. budget shouldn't come 
here at all.
  I recognized that while pursuing statehood, I could get close to 
statehood by simply finishing the Home


Rule Act and making it whole and complete, and so I embarked on a two-
track road. One, of course, is the one I have just discussed: D.C. 
statehood.
  The other is what I call free and equal D.C. bills, bills that 
together bring us close to statehood. I started with a congressional 
review amendment. This one is really nonsensical.
  The District passes a law. Ultimately, most of those laws matter not 
to the Congress and certainly aren't overturned, but the Home Rule Act 
says that the law shall not become final for 30 days, and that is 30 
consecutive days.
  The House is not in session consecutive days. This is Thursday, for 
example. We are out, so I don't know if it is 3 or 4 days this week 
that would be counted, but you have to count up till you get to 30 
days, and then, of course, the bill can become law.
  Well, it always does. No one uses this particular power at all. If 
they want to overturn D.C. laws, then they simply try to attach it to 
appropriations as they come.
  So this is completely unused, but it is terribly burdensome on the 
city, because you simply have to keep renewing these bills that have 
been passed in the District until you get finally through the 30-day 
period. It is ridiculous: not used by the Congress, burdensome on the 
city, should and could be gotten rid of without anyone noticing it in 
the Congress or caring about it. So I began with that one, which the 
Congress can't possibly care about, because it doesn't even use it 
ever.
  But look at some of the other things that could be done even without 
statehood, which is leading me to embark on this two-track system.
  For example, the District of Columbia does not have a local 
prosecutor, like a district attorney, for example, or a state's 
attorney.
  The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a Federal official, 
not chosen by the District of Columbia, but by the President of the 
United States, is essentially the district attorney for the District of 
Columbia. We have no say in this.
  And that U.S. attorney has a jurisdiction that has nothing to do with 
what U.S. attorneys do in other States. It is local law. 90 percent of 
what the U.S. attorney has as jurisdiction is local law, like the law a 
DA would enforce. About 10, sometimes 15 percent of his work is 
Federal.
  We want to send him back to all of his Federal work, give him time to 
do all of that so that we would have a local prosecutor.
  That is one of the bills that this Congress could pass, House and 
Senate, and hardly think about it, because it is certainly 
uncontroversial that the city have its own law enforcement officer to 
enforce its criminal laws.
  And there is a National Guard rule act. Now, that is the equivalent 
of what I am speaking of when I say that the Congress should have no 
interest, only the District.
  The National Guard cannot be called out in the event, for example, of 
a hurricane or a huge snowfall or a flood, only the President of the 
United States can.


  The President of the United States does not need to be bothered with 
tasks related to ordinary emergencies in the District of Columbia. 
Somehow, the Mayor would have to find the President and say: Please 
call out the National Guard. That is the local National Guard.
  We don't want jurisdiction over the National Guard when it comes to 
national matters. We want the same jurisdiction that the States have. 
The States have the right to call out the National Guard to protect 
their residents when there are natural disasters. That is, essentially, 
what we are asking for. So that, too, is part of my Free and Equal D.C. 
series.
  Again, there are 20 of these bills. Let me just indicate one other: 
the District of Columbia Home Rule Clemency Act. I investigated how 
often clemency is allowed or has been afforded, and I found only one 
instance. I will tell you why.
  The President of the United States alone can offer clemency to 
someone who has broken local law. Do you think he bothers or, for that 
matter, should bother? That is why they don't post anyone who gets 
clemency in the District of Columbia.
  These are the kind of local matters that are holdovers, absolute 
holdovers, from the days when the District had no home rule. We can't 
possibly hold our heads up as a democracy and have matters like this 
that cannot be attended at the local level.
  Occasionally, someone comes forward with the notion: We understand, 
Congressman. We want to make sure that the residents of the Nation's 
Capital have the same rights as other places. Here is what we would 
like to do. You come out of a portion of land, contributed by the State 
of Maryland, so why not return the District of Columbia to Maryland, 
then you would get your full and equal rights?
  Well, the first thing you ought to do is ask Maryland about that. 
Then you might ask the District of Columbia. And here I have the 
answers, I think.
  Statehood is endorsed by 86 percent of D.C. residents. Retrocession, 
as it is called, has no constituency either in Maryland or in the 
District.
  This is how I know that.
  There was a poll taken in Maryland asking whether or not they thought 
the District of Columbia should be returned to Maryland. Now, 
understand, Maryland is a very progressive jurisdiction, but it only 
has one big city. That is the city of Baltimore. It apparently is not 
welcoming of another city which has formed its own identity as a State 
and, for that reason, has an identity as a big city.
  I am not surprised that a poll of Maryland legislators found that 92 
percent of Maryland Senators oppose retrocession of the District to 
Maryland, and 82 percent of Maryland Delegates--that is their lower 
house--oppose retrocession.
  What I think this points up is that there are no easy answers: taking 
a city that is almost as old as the Nation itself--the District became 
the Capital City in 1801--and somehow finding some easy answer, which 
turns out to be even harder. It is hard enough to get the Congress to 
recognize statehood.
  Now, suppose we have to go to Maryland, in the case of retrocession, 
and D.C. to get that answer. That is a harder road to climb. It is not 
democratic, because that is not what Maryland wants and that is not 
what the District of Columbia wants. It is a very mechanical answer to 
a very deep problem.
  I indicated that I just voted in the Congress in the Committee of the 
Whole, and I have voted now, in this new Congress, which is about 8 
weeks old, two or three times. Each of those votes are of such great 
significance to the people I represent. It encourages them to believe 
that they will have a vote not only in the Committee of the Whole, but 
they will have a vote where every other American has a vote.
  For them, I can only say that they have overpaid, in every 
conceivable way, for equal rights--yes, by fighting and dying in every 
war and, yes, in Federal taxes paid, per capita, a larger amount than 
any residents.
  For me, of course, this is a labor of love because I was born and 
raised here. I am the daughter of a runaway slave who ran away from 
Virginia.
  It is interesting that he ran away and found himself and settled in 
the District of Columbia as an illegal immigrant, I suppose--a runaway 
slave--but there was work here. He found work in the city and began to 
raise work helping to build the city because they were building the 
roads of the city at that time in the 1830s.
  It was no part of his vision that the District would ever have the 
same rights as other Americans, certainly no part of his vision, as 
then still a slave, that he would have anything to do with it.
  So, this afternoon, as I think about my city and strive for its 
equality, I think of my great-grandfather, Richard Holmes, who sought 
freedom for himself and his family the only way he could: by simply 
walking off of a plantation and making his way to the District of 
Columbia. In his name, I am honored to seek more of that freedom and 
equality for the 700,000 Americans who now live in our Nation's 
Capital.

837,COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgH2276,0,Mrs. TRAHAN,"  Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a great sense of 
urgency.
  Every day it seems as if there is another news story about a shooting 
in a school, a movie theater, a synagogue, or on a city block. We have 
lost far too many lives due to gun violence.
  From my own community, I celebrate the life of Olivia Marchand from 
Westford, whose mother, Jody, endured years of domestic abuse. In 2010, 
she survived her husband's brutal attack but lost her beautiful Olivia 
when her husband shot and killed her and then killed himself.
  This tragedy devastated our whole community. As a mother, this loss 
still fills me with grief and anger.
  Today, Jody keeps her daughter's memory alive, educates women on 
domestic violence, and fights for tougher gun laws. We must answer 
America's call for action on gun violence, not the gun lobby's call to 
maintain the status quo.
  Yesterday, we passed universal background check legislation, a 
necessary first step to tackle gun violence in America. I urge my 
colleagues to continue voting for these critical reforms.

                             Appropriations
",,2019-02-28
849,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,11,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just a couple of short weeks ago, we 
finally finished the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills, and I 
greatly appreciate those who worked with us to get that done.
  I want to talk today about the need to reach a new 2-year budget 
deal. We have to do that so the Appropriations Committee could then 
begin to work in earnest on the fiscal year 2020 bills.
  We have shown that we can move the appropriations bills quickly, but 
we have to have the budget deal. In fact, unless we will get a budget 
deal, sequestration returns in fiscal year 2020. That would mean steep 
cuts in programs that invest in America and support working families.
  It means we would have to make cuts in our defense programs for the 
next fiscal year--cuts of $71 billion. This is real money. There would 
be a 10-percent cut in funding to support our troops and to invest in 
military readiness.
  It would also require that we cut $55 billion for nondefense programs 
in the next fiscal year. That is a 9-percent cut. The reality is, it 
means less investment in infrastructure, education, housing, or 
agricultural programs. It means less money for veterans' healthcare, 
protecting our environment, or combating the opioid epidemic.
  These cuts are not just hypothetical numbers on a piece of paper. 
They affect real people and real families. They affect people in my 
State. They affect the people in the State of the distinguished 
Presiding Officer. They affect people in the 50 States represented by 
all 100 of us.
  Of course, the worst part about that is the cuts will come at the 
same time we are facing significant increases in important programs 
that we have no control over.
  For example, we have to fund the decennial census. The Constitution 
requires us to have this census, and we have to fund it by $4 billion 
if we are going to follow what the Constitution of the United States 
requires us to do in conducting the 2020 census.
  We have all talked about veterans' healthcare. We have had a 
significant increase in the healthcare costs for veterans, and we have 
to have significant increases in the budget if we are going to 
adequately fund their health.
  The VA MISSION Act, which provides additional private care options 
for veterans, becomes effective in June of this year. That is going to 
cost at least an additional $3 billion, and estimates could climb 
significantly higher. That is on top of the $3 billion increase for VA 
medical care that we have already enabled through advance 
appropriations.
  Then we are going to need an additional $1 billion to ensure that an 
estimated 5 million people who receive affordable housing assistance 
can stay in their homes. In addition to these increased costs, we 
expect to lose nearly $4 billion in receipts and cost savings in other 
programs compared to this year.
  This may sound like just a whole lot of numbers. It is more than 
that. It means we have $15 billion right off the bat that we must 
account for above this year's levels. Of course, I am sure there will 
be more increases that we will have to address.
  As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know how hard 
Chairman Shelby and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get 
through the bills we had this past year. We got them done, but it was 
not easy staying within levels.


  We have to have a 2-year budget deal. We have to negotiate it now. If 
we wait until the very last second to pass these bills, it will cost 
the taxpayers a lot more money because the Departments cannot plan. We 
are not going to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it is going to 
fix itself.
  Of course, again, in the Appropriations Committee, we try to work in 
a bipartisan way. But we cannot responsibly do our job in the absence 
of cap levels that allow us to meet the needs of the American people.
  Again, this is not just an accounting issue. This is the security and 
the well-being of the greatest Nation on Earth. It is not rhetoric; it 
is reality.
  The budget deal has to be based on parity if we are going to pass it. 
It has to have equal treatment for defense and nondefense programs, as 
we have had in the past.
  We have to invest on both sides of the ledger if we are going to 
create a strong national defense, a strong economy, and a healthy 
citizenry of the United States.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
a letter to all Senators that was received yesterday from over 300 
retired admirals and generals who agree with this premise.",L000174,2019-02-28
850,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,12,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. These admirals and generals, many of whom I know and a lot 
of whom I do not, have been here with Republican and Democratic 
administrations, but they are all people who have served our Nation and 
care about our Nation. They are part of a coalition called Mission: 
Readiness, Council for a Strong America. They call on Congress to 
negotiate balanced investments in both defense and nondefense programs.
  They wrote: ``As members of Mission: Readiness, we recognize the fact 
that the strength of our military--and our Nation--is dependent on the 
strength of our people.''
  We have certainly seen this. You can go back to the time of World War 
II, when Harry Truman found that we could not find the people we needed 
in our military because of things like malnutrition or a lack of 
education; we needed to improve the nutrition programs in our schools. 
This is not rhetoric; it is reality.
  These admirals and generals want a strong United States of America, 
just as I do and just as every single Member of this body--of either 
party--wants.
  If the press reports are accurate, the President is planning to send 
up a budget on March 11 that not only fails to provide a constructive 
path forward, but it is going to be dead on arrival. If press reports 
are accurate, the President will, yet again, propose deep cuts to 
nondefense programs, even though Congress has rejected President 
Trump's cuts for the last 2 fiscal years. Every Republican and every 
Democrat knows that you have to have a balance between defense and 
nondefense programs.
  President Trump also proposes large increases for defense programs, 
paid for using a budget gimmick that his own Acting Chief of Staff, 
Mick Mulvaney, would rail against when he was in Congress. He says he 
will move large portions of the defense base budget into the Overseas 
Contingency Operation, or OCO, account so that it will not count 
against the budget caps. Mick Mulvaney and most Republicans and 
Democrats have said we cannot do this. It is not a recipe for success.
  OCO is meant for costs associated with military operations in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. It is there to address crises overseas. 
It supports our men and women deployed and in harm's way.
  The OCO account should not be used as a slush fund to pay for the 
everyday operations of the Department of Defense or to avoid a real 
debate on the budget caps.
  To suggest we should move billions in the base defense budget into 
OCO at a time when the President is actively reducing our troop 
presence overseas shows what a disingenuous move it is.
  I went back in my notes, and I found a letter written by then-
Congressman Mick Mulvaney--now the acting Chief of Staff for President 
Trump. He wrote this in March of 2014. It is strikingly relevant today, 
5 years later. Then-Congressman Mulvaney wrote a letter signed by 
numerous Members. He opposed a $10 billion increase in OCO, calling it 
is a ``misuse'' of funds and an attempt to ``circumvent the caps'' for 
things unrelated to overseas combat at a time when war operations were 
``winding down.'' He opposed the gimmick. He argued for greater 
transparency and discipline in the budget process.
  He said he would not want any President--well, of course, in that 
case, it was President Obama--to have this power. Now he is Acting 
Chief of Staff of another President, and we are told the President may 
propose an increase of $105 billion, more than doubling OCO funding, as 
we are withdrawing troops. That is not the way forward.
  Let's have an honest conversation, Republicans and Democrats 
together, about our needs as a nation. We have to do the hard work to 
set new caps. It is not easy. Every one of us will have to cast 
difficult votes. Well, so what? We are elected to a 6-year term. There 
is not a single Member of this body who, at one time or another during 
their campaigns, did not say something to the effect of ``I am willing 
to cast tough votes.''
  Well, let us have it, this onerous conversation. Let us do the hard 
work to set new caps. Let us cast those difficult votes. Let us show 
the people who elected us they did the right thing. Let us invest in 
the programs. Let us strengthen our military, grow our economy, improve 
our infrastructure, and build the future of this country we love. Let 
us not use a budget gimmick to frustrate that debate. Trust me, the 
American people will see through that kind of a gimmick.


  I am ready to have those conversations. I want to move forward with 
the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills. Let's get the work done the 
American people sent us here to do. If we have to stay a few evenings 
and if we have to stay a few weekends, let's do it. It is for the 
greatest Nation on Earth. Let's do it. I urge leadership on both sides 
of the aisle, in both Chambers of Congress, to begin these negotiations 
now.
  Then we have to take up, with urgency, a disaster package. In the 
last 2 years, we have had the deadliest disaster seasons in recent 
memory--Hurricanes Michael, Florence, Irma, and Maria, the California 
wildfires, volcanic eruptions in Hawaii, and typhoons along the Pacific 
coast. These communities, States, and territories need our help.
  When Tropical Storm Irene hit Vermont in 2011, I found out firsthand 
how devastating natural disasters can be. Roads were washed away, towns 
and villages were cut off from vital services, and people's homes were 
destroyed.
  The day after Irene, I went around the State of Vermont with our 
Governor and with the head of our National Guard in a helicopter, 
landing in small towns. Many times the only way you could get into 
these towns was by helicopter because roads were gone and the bridges 
were gone.
  You would see bridges, like a child's toy, twisted and a mile from 
where it was supposed to be. A farmhouse that had been on the north 
side of the river was now upside down on the south side of the river. 
We were in the middle of the State, and we knew it was critical. The 
Federal Government provided assistance to help recovery because we are 
part of the United States of America.
  The people of Puerto Rico and others that have been so badly damaged, 
these are Americans. We should stand together to help them. I am sorry 
we were not able to reach agreement to include a disaster package in 
the fiscal year 2019 minibus we passed just 2 weeks ago. We were so 
close to an agreement on a package--so very close, Republicans and 
Democrats alike. It would have addressed the needs of all impacted 
communities.
  It broke down because the President insisted we eliminate disaster 
assistance for Puerto Rico. I guess he thought tossing rolls of paper 
towels for the people is good enough. Puerto Rico is part of the United 
States. It is not, as the White House described it, an island 
surrounded by water, I guess, as compared to those other islands. It is 
a part of the United States. These are American people. They have 
served in our military. They help us in our medical facilities. They 
are Americans, and they cannot be left out.
  Hurricanes Maria and Irma--they had two hurricanes--devastated Puerto 
Rico. They destroyed the island's homes and infrastructure. They caused 
the deaths of an estimated 2,975 people. It was one of the deadliest 
hurricanes our country has ever seen, certainly in my lifetime.
  Now, we provided Puerto Rico assistance in past disaster bills, but 
they have so many unaddressed needs that have to be met. Many people, 
even after the hurricane, are still living in temporary housing. Roads, 
bridges, and communities still need to be rebuilt. One of the largest 
infrastructure projects to be undertaken on the island is the 
rebuilding of Puerto Rico's energy grid, which needs more assistance.
  Most importantly, in the absence of supplemental assistance, we 
estimate that 140,000 Puerto Ricans, U.S. citizens, are going to lose 
nutrition assistance at the end of March.
  We are the United States of America--United States of America--and 
this is the U.S. Senate. We are supposed to take care of all our 
citizens when they have crises. We do not pick and choose based on with 
whom we are politically aligned.
  I voted for disaster relief for States that were predominantly 
Republican and other States that were predominantly Democratic, but I 
don't look at it like that. I look at the fact that they are part of 
the United States of America, and they had a disaster. They should be 
helped.
  Last month, the House passed H.R. 268, a comprehensive disaster 
package that provided over $14 billion to help all States and 
territories impacted by recent disasters to help them recover and 
rebuild. I worked closely with the House on this bill. I believe it 
will address the needs of all disaster-impacted communities.
  On Tuesday, Senators Perdue and Jones and others, working very hard, 
introduced a similar but not identical bill. I am taking these bills 
with me this weekend. I am going to review them carefully. I thank the 
bipartisan group of Senators--Senators Perdue and Jones and others--for 
bringing the issue back to the forefront of the Senate. I am certainly 
committed to working with my good friend Chairman Shelby. I also worked 
with Republicans and Democrats in the House Appropriations Committee. I 
want a package that can pass both Chambers in addressing the needs of 
all States and territories hit by recent disasters.
  I certainly urge the majority leader, Senator McConnell, to commit to 
bringing this to the floor as soon as possible. With that, I see other 
Senators on the floor.
  I yield the floor.",L000174,2019-02-28

                       Remembering Otto Warmbier
",,2019-02-28
852,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,14,Mr. PORTMAN,"  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, in the context of the ongoing 
negotiations with North Korea, there has been a lot of discussion today 
in the media about Otto Warmbier.
  Otto Warmbier was a young man from my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. 
This is an emotional issue for me because, through the process of 
trying to bring Otto home, I got to know his family very well.
  He was a young man with a lot of promise, 22 years old, and a college 
student at the University of Virginia. He had gone as a tourist to 
North Korea. He was pulled out of the line at the airport.
  Here he was, a kindhearted college kid, found himself a prisoner in 
North Korea. He was there for about 18 months. His detainment and his 
sentence were appalling; unacceptable by any standards. At some point 
soon after being sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, from what we 
know, Otto suffered a severe brain injury. What happened? We may never 
know the details, but we do know one thing, and that is he was severely 
mistreated.
  Who did the North Korean Government tell about the fact that he had 
this brain damage? No one. Unbelievably, for the next 15 months of his 
life, they kept this a secret. They denied him access to the best 
medical care he deserved, which of course we would have provided.
  I was in communication with the North Korean Government during this 
time through their offices at the United Nations in New York. They 
didn't even tell us about the terrible mistreatment he had suffered and 
the condition he was in. They refused repeated requests for consular 
access that normally would have been provided to someone who has been 
detained, regardless of their health situation. This included denying 
requests, of course, from me, from others in this body and other bodies 
of Congress but also from the Obama administration, the Trump 
administration, the Red Cross, also from the Government of Sweden, 
which typically acts for us in North Korea as a consular service. I say 
that because while I support engagement with North Korea--in fact, in 
my experience with Otto Warmbier, it makes me even more convinced we 
need to have communication because we had no good lines of 
communication.
  I support the ongoing talks with North Korea, specifically about 
denuclearization. I want to make clear that we can never forget about 
Otto. His treatment at the hands of his captors was unforgivable, and 
it tells us a lot about the nature of the regime. We can't be naive 
about what they did to Otto, about the brutal nature of the regime that 
would do this to an American citizen.
  Of course, it is not just about Otto or other visitors. It is about 
how the people of North Korea are treated, many of whom also have had 
their human rights violated. No one should have to go through what the 
Warmbier family has gone through. They have been incredibly strong, by 
the way, through this whole ordeal. I watched them channel their grief 
into something constructive, exposing some of the human rights abuses 
in North Korea, as an example.


  Throughout this ordeal, I have stood with Fred and Cindy and their 
entire family. I will continue to, but I also want to say today, as we 
discuss these broader issues with North Korea, let's keep Otto Warmbier 
at the front of our minds. Let's be sure he is high on our agenda and 
in our consciousness as we deal with North Korea and, again, 
understanding, because of our experience with Otto, the brutal nature 
of this regime.


                          China Investigation

  Mr. President, I will now talk about the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations' hearing we had today.
  I am here to talk about China and the impact it is having on the U.S. 
education system. I chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, 
which is a subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs 
Committee. My colleague Tom Carper, on the other side of the aisle, is 
the ranking member. We worked together on bipartisan--I believe you 
would say nonpartisan investigations.
  We had success working on the opioid crisis in coming up with 
legislation to stop fentanyl from coming through the mail, the 
deadliest of all the drugs. We also had success in pushing back against 
human trafficking, leading to actually shutting down the website that 
trafficked more women and children than any other one, backpage.com.
  Today we looked at something that is also very important for our 
country; that is, understanding better how these Confucius Institutes 
work. We issued a bipartisan report today talking about how there is a 
lack of transparency in how American colleges and universities manage 
their Confucius Institutes. These are located at more than 100 colleges 
and universities around the country. These institutions in America have 
received more than $150 million in support from the Government of China 
for these Confucius Institutes since 2006.
  Confucius Institutes are enterprises that engage in the teaching of 
Chinese culture and language, and they are at universities and colleges 
around the world. These Confucius Institutes are designed, funded, and 
primarily staffed by the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government 
bills them as an opportunity for cultural exchange, and the funding 
comes from them. It is an appealing prospect for many U.S. schools 
trying to meet their demand for language instruction, but we need to be 
careful.
  There needs to be more transparency in how these institutes operate 
in the United States, and there needs to be more reciprocity so the 
United States can also provide its cultural institutions in China. That 
is not happening now because China has systematically shut down 
comparable U.S. State Department public diplomacy efforts on college 
campuses in China.
  Let me be clear. I do support cultural exchange--we all should; it is 
a good thing--with China and with the international community more 
broadly, but there needs to be reciprocity, and there needs to be 
appropriate engagement without, in this case, the Chinese Government 
determining what is said and what is done on U.S. campuses.
  The law must be followed. That is why transparency is so important.
  This morning we held a hearing following an 8-month investigation 
into this issue. Based on our findings, let me focus on these two 
issues of transparency and reciprocity--transparency in how colleges 
and universities manage the institutes which are controlled, funded, 
and mostly staffed by the Chinese Government and the lack of 
reciprocity in how China does not permit U.S. State Department 
programming in China.
  Our report details how China, known for its one-sided dealings in 
trade--not having a level playing field in trade--also does not have a 
level playing field with regard to these cultural changes.
  Our report documents how U.S. officials had expressed concerns about 
China's influence through its Confucius Institutes. Recently, the FBI's 
Assistant Director for Counterintelligence testified before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee that the Confucius Institutes are ``not strictly a 
cultural institute'' and that ``they are ultimately beholden to the 
Chinese government.'' The State Department has labeled Confucius 
Institutes ``China's most prominent soft power platform.''
  Higher education groups have also expressed concern. The American 
Council of Education, the National Association of Scholars, and the 
American Association of University Professors have all recommended that 
U.S. schools fundamentally change how they manage Confucius Institutes 
or consider shutting them down.
  Other foreign governments have already acted. For example, the UK 
Conservative Party Commission on Human Rights called for the suspension 
of further agreements until it can complete a more comprehensive review 
of potential threats to academic freedom at the Confucius Institutes in 
the United Kingdom.
  The Canadian Province of New Brunswick recently announced that it 
would cease its Confucius Institute operations, citing academic freedom 
concerns and that the program provides a ``one-dimensional'' view of 
China. Finally, an Australian State, New South Wales, is currently 
reviewing the Confucius Institute program, citing that it exposes 
children to propaganda.
  These concerns are well-founded. Past statements by Chinese officials 
make clear the purpose of Confucius Institutes. For example, in 2011, a 
former member of the Chinese Government explained:

       The Confucius Institute is an appealing brand for expanding 
     our culture abroad. It has made an important contribution 
     toward improving our soft power. The ``Confucius'' brand has 
     a natural attractiveness. Using the excuse of teaching 
     Chinese language, everything looks reasonable and logical.

  The Director General of Confucius Institute Headquarters has also 
commented on how the program controls messaging about controversial 
topics. She said in 2014:

       Every mainland China teacher we send . . . will say Taiwan 
     belongs to China. We should have one China. No hesitation.

  So with regard to issues like Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square, 
the Confucius Institutes stay away from those issues that are 
considered controversial.
  We know that Confucius Institutes exist as one part of China's 
broader, long-term strategy, but China has invested heavily in them, 
giving about $150 million to U.S. schools just in the last decade. 
China's other long-term initiatives include its Made in China 2025 
plan, which is a push to lead the world in certain advanced technology 
manufacturing. The Thousand Talents Program is another state-run 
initiative designed to recruit Chinese researchers in the United States 
to return to China for significant financial gain, bringing with them 
the research knowledge gained at U.S. universities and companies. We 
plan on continuing to examine the U.S. Government's responses to these 
issues as well.
  Confucius Institutes, by the way, do not stop at colleges and 
universities alone. China has also opened more than 500 Confucius 
Classrooms programs at U.S. K-12 schools. In fact, the Confucius 
Classroom program is a priority for the Chinese Government. A document 
obtained by the subcommittee during our investigation details a plan to 
expand Confucius Classrooms by seeking ``top-down policy support from 
the state government, legislative and educational institutions, with 
particular emphasis on access to the support from school district 
superintendents and principals.''
  Over the last 8 months, we interviewed U.S. school officials, 
teachers, and Confucius Institute instructors. We also reviewed tens of 
thousands of pages of contracts, emails, financial records, and other 
internal documents obtained from more than 100 U.S. schools that were 
either active or recently closed Confucius Institutes.
  Since our investigation started, more than 10 U.S. schools announced 
they would be closing their Confucius Institutes. We found that Chinese 
funding for Confucius Institutes comes with strings attached--strings 
that can compromise academic freedom. The Chinese Government vets and 
approves all Chinese directors and teachers, events, research 
proposals, and speakers at U.S. Confucius Institutes. Chinese teachers 
sign contracts pledging with the Chinese Government that they will 
follow Chinese law and ``conscientiously safeguard China's national 
interests.''
  Some schools actually contractually agreed that both Chinese and U.S. 
law will apply at Confucius Institutes in


the United States on their school campuses. Think about that. American 
universities are agreeing to comply with Chinese law on their campuses. 
This application of Chinese law at these schools can result, of course, 
in exporting China's censorship of political debate and prevent 
discussion of politically sensitive topics.
  As such, numerous U.S. school officials told the subcommittee that 
Confucius Institutes were not the place to discuss topics like the 
independence of Taiwan, Tibet, or the Tiananmen Square massacre. Put 
simply, as one U.S. school administrator told us: ``You know what 
you're getting when something is funded by the Chinese government.''
  Investigators from the Government Accountability Office also spoke 
with U.S. officials, who acknowledge that hosting the Confucius 
Institute could limit events or activities critical of China, not just 
at the Confucius Institute but also elsewhere on campus.
  In response to the growing popularity of Confucius Institutes, the 
United States initiated its own public diplomacy program in China 
through the State Department. The Chinese Government effectively shut 
it down. Since 2010, the State Department has provided $5.1 million in 
grant funding for 29 American Cultural Centers in China. Through this 
program, a U.S. school would partner with a Chinese school to set up a 
cultural center, which would enable Chinese students to better 
understand our country, our culture.
  The Chinese Government stifled the program from the start. Seven of 
the 29 American Cultural Centers never even opened. Of those that did 
open, they needed permission from the Chinese partner schools, 
sometimes including local Chinese Communist Party officials, just to 
hold events. Eventually, because of the obstacles, the State Department 
stopped funding the program altogether. There are four programs 
remaining. They are all going to be phased out entirely by this summer.
  We heard some very interesting testimony today from the State 
Department--testimony that details the academic environment in China 
that has made it impossible for us to have the kind of freedom they 
enjoy over here. The State Department testimony aligns with the 
findings of our investigation.
  For example, while the State Department conducts various public 
diplomacy programs in China, the Chinese Government has increasingly 
impeded access to some segments of Chinese society, including Chinese 
schools and universities. All Chinese institutions, including 
universities, have a foreign affairs officer or a ``gatekeeper'' that 
is an internal governmental office that manages contact between the 
non-Chinese entities and the institution. Any Chinese institutions that 
wish to interact with foreign government officials must obtain approval 
first from this gatekeeper.
  The State Department even told us that the Fulbright Program, a 
prestigious and longstanding student exchange program, is impeded as 
Chinese authorities have prevented Chinese alumni of the Fulbright 
Program from forming a Fulbright Association, a standard practice in 
other countries. We even heard directly from an American educator who 
was detained by the Chinese police and questioned extensively about her 
involvement with a State Department grant. While the Department of 
State said they conveyed to the Chinese Government that it expects 
reciprocal access for U.S. diplomats in our programs, it is not 
happening. Obviously, more needs to be done.
  While the State Department is mostly known for its overseas 
diplomatic efforts, it also has oversight responsibilities right here 
in the United States with regard to these Confucius Institutes. The 
State Department conducts field site reviews to ensure that foreign 
nationals who come to the United States on these Exchange Visitor 
Programs have visas that are appropriate and that they are here for the 
stated reason.
  There are roughly 100 Confucius Institutes at colleges and 
universities in America, yet the State Department has conducted field 
visits only to two of them. At those two, they found serious problems. 
At the Confucius Institute, the State Department revoked more than 30 
visas for Chinese visitors who were supposed to be working at the 
university that sponsored their visa but were actually teaching in the 
K-12 environment. They also discovered evidence of ``fraudulent 
paperwork and coaching'' that was a ``deliberate attempt to deceive'' 
investigators, according to the State Department.
  The Chinese director coached the Chinese teachers to tell the State 
Department they were working on research programs that they really 
weren't working on at the university's campus.
  State also told us it does not collect the visa information 
specifically related to the Confucius Institute, so we don't know how 
many Confucius Institute teachers there are or where they are. Again, 
they visited only 2 schools out of 100, and in those they found serious 
problems with regard to the State Department's responsibilities on 
visas.
  Our investigation also identified failures at the Department of 
Education that have contributed to a lack of transparency and oversight 
at schools that take money from foreign governments. If a U.S. school 
receives more than $250,000 from a single foreign source in 1 year, it 
is required by law to report that data to the Department of Education, 
which, in turn, publishes it on its website. The Department of 
Education, however, has not issued any guidance on foreign gift 
reporting for 14 years, the same year that China opened its first 
Confucius Institute, and our investigation was able to find that 70 
percent of the colleges and universities that should have reported 
receiving funds for Confucius Institutes from China did not; 70 percent 
are out of compliance. When a school fails to report a foreign gift, 
the Department of Justice can force the school to comply, but only at 
the request of the Secretary of Education. The Department of Education 
has never referred this type of case to them--never.
  We received two important commitments at the hearing this morning. 
One is the Department of Education has committed to issuing new 
guidance to the more than 3,000 schools it oversees. This guidance is 
important to ensure that schools know that they are obligated to report 
receiving these foreign government funding sources. They also agreed to 
step up their enforcement on the law on reporting foreign government 
funds from Confucius Institutes.
  The State Department committed this morning to do more to ensure 
visas are being properly used at Confucius Institutes around the 
country. Again, they conducted only two site reviews. They have to do 
more, and they said they will. We are going to follow up on that.
  As with all of our investigations, we are developing legislation 
aimed at addressing the problems identified here today. I want to call 
attention, as I conclude, to a news report that came out just a couple 
of days ago. The Chinese Communist Party's central committee and the 
Cabinet published a document stating that the Confucius Institutes will 
remain ``a key government policy.'' Specifically, the news report plans 
to ``optimize'' the spread of Confucius Institutes. While it is unclear 
what ``optimize'' means at this point, any legislation must try to 
anticipate the potential rebranding of Confucius Institutes or other 
efforts that may seek to avoid the transparency, disclosure, and 
reciprocity that is needed if these programs are to continue on our 
campuses.
  Thank you.

                         Tribute to Bruce King
",,2019-02-28
854,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,16,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my good friend from Georgia has to 
get somewhere, and I have to get somewhere. I will be very brief.
  I want to take a moment to pay tribute. We have staffers here who are 
just unsung heroes. They work day in and day out. Because of their 
diligent work, the world and the country is a better place.
  One of these people who works in quiet dignity and gets so much done 
and is so well respected is Bruce King. He has been indispensable at my 
office, and today, this afternoon, it is my unfortunate duty to say 
farewell to Bruce.
  He has worked in the Senate in some capacity since 1984. He has 
worked for Judiciary, Senator Lautenberg, the Budget Committee, and as 
the senior


counsel for multiple Democratic leaders on the Federal budget, 
stretching from Leader Daschle to Leader Reid to me. In that short 
time, Bruce wasn't short of legislative achievement, from negotiating 
the balanced budget agreement of 1997 to blocking the privatization of 
Social Security in 2006, from shepherding health reform through the 
Senate to passing the financial rescue bill after the crisis in 2008.
  One of our most distinguished Senators would be proud of that record. 
Their name would be in lights. Bruce did all of that and much more in 
his, as I said, quiet, steadfast, brilliant dignity.
  I have never sat on the Budget or Appropriations Committees, so when 
I became leader, having his experience and wisdom was incredible. I 
have met no one who could take these complex issues and put them in 
terms that even someone like myself could understand, not being an 
expert on those things. He was able to understand the big picture and 
never get caught in the minutia, although he knew the minutia extremely 
well.
  When you ask Bruce's opinion on a matter, he presents it so 
succinctly and persuasively that you know it is the right answer in a 
matter of minutes, until he decides to play devil's advocate against 
his first opinion and convinces you of the opposite because he is one 
of those staffers who has never had an ax to grind. He said: Let my 
Senators know both sides, and let them decide.

  But we knew both sides so well and so lucidly because of Bruce's 
ability to take these issues and help us understand them.
  He can juggle so many variables in his head at once. He can weigh the 
pros and cons. He has an instinctive knowledge of how to deal with the 
tradeoffs, and he can keep it all in a simple way.
  He is a modest man. He has sat at the same desk in the Capitol for 14 
years. Every day, he brings his lunch--peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches--and he leaves the office at almost the same time every 
night to have dinner at home with Janis, his beloved wife.
  Senators get the spotlight and the credit when our initiatives 
succeed, but so many initiatives would never have succeeded without 
Bruce King. Bruce, through the years, deserves an ocean of credit for 
his work. He would never claim a drop of it because he is a humble man.
  For all his expertise, he is humble, kindhearted, and thoughtful. 
Everyone likes him. In all the years he has worked here, I never heard 
a single person say a single bad thing about him. That is a pretty good 
tribute in a place like the Senate.
  Bruce's departure will be a loss to his friends and colleagues and to 
the Senate as a whole and, of course, to my office.
  There is only one bad thing I can say about him. He switched his 
allegiance from the New York Mets to the Nationals. The good news is 
that he will be able to catch some more games with Janis, his son 
Aaron, and his daughter Liana.
  Bruce, you are a blessing to our office, to the Senate, and to the 
country. We wish you the best.

                            Disaster Relief

  Mr. President, I will be very brief. Two things happen at this time 
of day every day in the Senate and only two. The first is that the last 
person having their say finally gets up and says it, which means that 
you all have to listen to me for a minute. When the last person speaks, 
they don't tell you anything new. They tell you what everybody else 
said in a different way. You get to hear a small speech about that.
  The other thing that happens is that Sheldon Whitehouse comes to the 
floor and talks about global warming. That happens every day. Sheldon 
hasn't been down here. I don't know if he is sick. I don't know where 
he is. I am going to replace Sheldon for a minute.
  Every day goes by, and we ought to talk about climate change and 
things like that. I am going to talk about disaster relief, which ties 
right into climate change. I am not a global warming guy, except to say 
I think it is going on. It has been going on since the planet was 
created. It will be going on long since we are gone. How tough it is 
depends on our dealing with it--how we sequester carbon, how we manage 
carbon, and how we have businesses and industries find new ways to fuel 
their industries and fuel their mechanisms, and things like that.
  Tell Sheldon when you see him that I came down to talk about how we 
do need to address these things. It is all of our responsibility. We 
can address it in a positive way, just like we did in the Montreal 
Protocol, where 25 years ago we got rid of fluorocarbons that were 
drilling a hole in the atmosphere and causing us to have terrible 
cancer of the skin.
  Tell Sheldon I have listened to him. I heard some of his great 
speeches. Mine is not nearly as close to how good his are. I wanted to 
make sure a day didn't go by without our saying what Sheldon says.
  I want to talk about the disaster bill that Senator Leahy, only a few 
minutes ago on the floor, talked about, and I want to talk about the 
urgent job we need to do in the Senate.
  We had terrible disasters in the South and Southeast 3 years ago. We 
had hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. Billions of dollars were lost in 
South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and other 
locations. We failed to meet the disaster demands that we have to help 
those farmers and ag producers and business and industries to get back 
on their feet.
  We now have a dire crisis. We have an emergency in the Southeast. It 
is time we got the disaster bill that we have been trying to pass for a 
year passed. We had it as a rider twice. We had it as a rider on the 
bill that was going to end the shutdown. At the last minute, it got 
negotiated out of the picture, not because it was a bad bill but 
because nobody would leave it in there and it did free up some money.
  We have until March 15 to get it done. If we don't, there are going 
to be farmers in most of the Southeast who are going out of business. 
Industries that this Nation depends on will be terrible. You will pay 
way too much for your food. I don't know about you, but if you don't 
have nutrition to go with the energy you need, you don't have anything.
  I am here to plead with every Democrat and every Republican that when 
we get the bill to the floor--and it will be some time before March 
15--to support the disaster relief bill for the Southeastern United 
States and for Puerto Rico. The Democrats wanted so badly to add Puerto 
Rico to it, and the President signed off on that part. So we don't have 
a problem with the executive branch. I ask you to support all of the 
other provisions in it to see that those who were so badly damaged get 
their relief.
  Let me tell you what that relief is. I am not talking about a 
handout. As an example, I am talking about the pecan industry that is 
housed in my State of Georgia. It is a tremendous industry in Asia. It 
is a tremendous export in the United States, with a tremendous balance 
of payments which contribute to our country. Well, 70 percent was wiped 
out. It takes 15 to 20 years to replace a pecan orchard. They have to 
start growth from a seedling to be a full, maturing tree to produce the 
crops to get to the marketplace.
  Some of our crops are annual crops. A lot of them are long-term 
longevity crops. It is very important that we get them back on their 
feet. We will reclaim our place in the marketplace, but if we don't, 
somebody will take it away from us. Maybe it is Egypt, maybe it is 
India, or maybe it is somebody else.
  I am down here to say that climate does change and we can do 
something about it by addressing carbon. And the economy changes. We 
can do something about it by helping industries.
  When disasters come, if they are not responded to quickly and 
resolutely, they end up causing big losses to everybody in business, in 
productivity, and in our industries.
  I want to ask everybody on the floor to please join me--hopefully, 
before the 15th or at least by the 14th of March--


to support the disaster bill that passed. Senator Shelby, Senator 
Leahy, myself, Senator Perdue, and Senator Rubio, and many others 
worked very hard on this to bring it together to get the pieces that 
were missing in place.
  I want to thank, particularly, Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy for 
the time they and their staff have given us in the last couple of weeks 
to try to recover from the vote 2 weeks ago, when we lost what we 
thought was a solution to this problem.
  Mr. President, I appreciate the time on the floor.
  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Delaware.",I000055,2019-02-28

unmet disaster needs in this country. I look forward to working with

United States and other States.


                             Climate Change
",C001088,2019-02-28
859,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,21,Mr. COONS,"  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about 
climate change--to talk about something that is a pressing and real 
problem that affects everyone in this country, and, in fact, in our 
world. It is a challenge that we can't afford to ignore any longer 
because the health of our families, our economy, our environment, and 
even our national security, quite literally, depend on our ability to 
address it and address it promptly.
  After a year of recordbreaking extreme weather in 2018--when we saw 
rising average temperatures fuel California's deadliest wildfire season 
on record, when Florida was faced with the strongest hurricane ever to 
reach that State's panhandle, and when farmers in Delaware and across 
the country faced challenges due to severe flooding and drought--it is 
clear that we can't afford to sit back and do nothing about climate 
change while the American people pay the price.
  The costs of our inaction are real--real in human suffering, real in 
disaster recovery spending, real in lost economic opportunity, and real 
in the burden borne by our Armed Forces around the world.
  Yes, there is a clear link between climate change and national 
security. The Pentagon has consistently pointed to climate change as a 
real national security threat that will make the military's job around 
the world harder. National security leaders from across 
administrations, both Republican and Democratic, have warned that 
climate change acts as a ``threat multiplier,'' increasing global 
instability and weakening fragile States as climate change leads to 
more extreme weather events and scarcer food and water resources.
  In many ways, these findings echo themes about climate change that we 
already know--that it is already happening, that it continues to get 
worse, that it is going to cost us dearly, and that we can do something 
about it. It is that last point that I want to focus on. We can do 
something to stop the disastrous impacts of climate change, so long as 
we recognize it and work together in a bipartisan way to develop, take 
up, debate, and pass meaningful legislation that can make a difference.
  Democrats have a broad range of bold and new policy proposals and of 
tested and fully developed policy proposals to address climate change. 
Many of them are bipartisan.
  I wanted to come to the floor today to talk through 4 different bills 
that I have cosponsored--some that are relatively new and some 
considered across several Congresses--that are positive, constructive 
steps forward we can take to address climate change.
  The first, and probably my oldest bill in this field, is called the 
MLP Parity Act--a catchy name, I know. It has five Republican 
colleagues who have cosponsored it now over three Congresses. This bill 
expands to renewable forms of energy, to carbon capture and 
sequestration, and to renewable and so-called clean energy a popular 
and long-established tax tool for financing energy projects that the 
oil and gas and pipeline sectors have enjoyed for decades. It would 
level the playing field. It would stop picking winners and losers in 
terms of energy tax policy. It would be, literally, an ``all of the 
above'' energy financing strategy. If enacted, it would be the first 
permanent change for the financing of clean energy projects in the U.S. 
Tax Code--potentially, worth billions of new private investment in 
renewable forms of energy.
  It is also cosponsored by the Republican chair of the Energy 
Committee, Senator Murkowski, the Republican chair of the Banking 
Committee, Senator Crapo, and three other colleagues from across the 
country. We have five Democrats and five Republicans. It has had a 
hearing in front of the Energy Committee and a hearing in front of the 
Finance Committee in previous Congresses. This is the sort of solid, 
scored bipartisan bill that would be a meaningful step forward in 
addressing climate change.
  Senator Lindsey Graham and I have introduced the IMPACT for Energy 
Act to create a private foundation to support cutting-edge energy 
research and technology commercialization. Why would we do this? What 
am I talking about?
  Well, a guy named Bill Gates, one of the greatest inventors and 
innovators in American history, wants to deploy private investments and 
foundation investments alongside the Department of Energy, in 
partnership with a lot of other individuals, to significantly 
accelerate the cutting-edge research being done at our National 
Laboratories through the Department of Energy.
  This is a tool that several other Federal Agencies already have. It 
is a so-called private foundation that allows them to marry up private 
sector dollars--foundation dollars--with Federal dollars to leverage 
greater impact. This private foundation can go out and raise that 
additional money and add it to the energy R&D already being funded by 
the Federal Government.
  I also want to applaud the hard and bipartisan work of my colleagues, 
led by Senators Murkowski and Cantwell on the Energy Committee, on a 
comprehensive energy bill with a wide range of policy ideas that can 
move us forward. It has several components that I contributed and that 
would help to address climate change. I very much hope that in this 
Congress we can finally take up this bipartisan bill and see it signed 
into law.
  Last, but in some ways most importantly, I want to mention a bill I 
offered at the end of the last Congress with my friend and former 
colleague, the Senator from Arizona, Jeff Flake. Despite our very 
different ideological, cultural and contextual backgrounds--we are from 
different States, from different faiths, and from different 
perspectives on the role of government and society; he is a real 
conservative, and I am a progressive Democratic--we still managed to 
come together and introduce a bill that addresses the cost of ignoring 
climate change and the impact it will have on the people in our home 
States.
  We offered the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. It is a 
commonsense bill to achieve significant and sustained emissions 
reductions and to help to mitigate the worse impacts of climate change. 
Our bill would accomplish this by using a free-market approach to 
pricing carbon pollution that would spur economic growth and put money 
back in the pockets of American taxpayers. Similar legislation has been 
introduced in the House of Representatives by a bipartisan coalition. I 
look forward to reintroducing this bill in this Congress.
  The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act should be the 
centerpiece of a robust, bipartisan climate agenda because it 
aggressively tackles emissions while optimizing economic growth and 
income for working families. We estimate that our bill would reduce 
emissions by 90 percent by 2050, while creating as many as 2 million 
net new jobs in the next decade.
  I believe this is an efficient way to use market forces to address 
the very real problem of climate change while creating jobs and 
opportunities for American workers. Frankly, an outright ban on 
nonrenewable sources would be inefficient and disruptive to workers 
from all sectors, but, in particular, across the building trades and 
other vital sectors of employment. In contrast, sending a strong market 
signal in favor of lower carbon or carbon-neutral energy would spur 
investment and growth in these technologies by the private sector and 
lead us toward a lower carbon future through competition.


  We don't need to choose between clean energy and economic growth or 
between combating climate change and creating jobs. These two goals are 
not permanently and mutually exclusive. They can go hand in hand if we 
craft the right policies. Still, we cannot move abruptly away from an 
economy that relies heavily on fossil fuels without having a real and 
coordinated plan for the very people--the millions of Americans--whose 
jobs will ultimately be impacted by that transition.
  Fortunately, a gradual transition to a clean energy future can also 
be an effective job creator. In 2017, the renewable energy and energy 
efficiency sectors alone employed 2.8 million Americans. If we place a 
price on carbon and then let the market work, we will create jobs 
across a wide range of industries, occupations, and geographies.
  As we work to deal with the effects of climate change by moving to a 
cleaner energy and infrastructure economy--an economy that is more 
resilient--we will need to rely on workers who are already in place in 
many of these industries. We will need building trades professionals to 
construct and maintain our new resilient and clean energy 
infrastructure. We will need manufacturing workers to build these more 
energy-efficient products. We will also need scientists and engineers 
to help research, develop, design, and deploy these new technologies. 
These workers bring real experience and skills to the table, and we 
must ensure that these skills translate into new, good jobs and that 
the workers in these new jobs are able to organize for fair 
competition, for fair compensation, and for fair work conditions.
  We can't tackle climate change alone. The United States is the 
largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, but our emissions have been 
declining in recent years. Meanwhile, China has whirred past us, and 
China and India and other countries are rapidly catching up in their 
carbon emissions. We need an approach that incentivizes these countries 
to reduce their emissions as well. The United States is a world leader 
in science and technology and innovation. We need to develop and 
advance new technologies--carbon-neutral technologies like small, 
modular nuclear reactors and carbon capture and sequestration--that we 
can export. Then we need to find ways to encourage countries like China 
and India to modernize and industrialize while also reducing their 
emissions.
  There is good work taking place in this area, and there are good 
solutions we can act on together. We need to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in a serious, thorough, deliberate, and thoughtful way. We 
need to be prepared to adapt to the ongoing impacts of climate change. 
We need to make sure American workers and families aren't left behind 
or are burdened by Federal climate policy.
  This administration, unfortunately, strikes me as taking us backward. 
We are voting on an EPA Administrator in this Chamber who is failing to 
take action on climate, even on action that is widely supported by 
industry. Our President just proposed a National Security Council 
initiative to counter the consensus around climate change and refute 
the idea that greenhouse gases are harmful to the environment. I 
shouldn't even need to say this, but that just isn't how science works.
  That is why, here in the Senate, we need to take the opportunity to 
lead and to have voices from both parties in Congress and in this 
country who want to take bold steps to address the climate. The hard 
part is going to be squaring these big, bold ideas with political 
reality. That is hard, but there are ways we can do it. Instead of 
being silent, we should bring this conversation to the forefront. 
Instead of debating whether climate change is real, we should be 
passing bipartisan bills, like the ones I have mentioned today, that 
can meaningfully address climate change and improve our economy.
  Climate change is a serious threat to our economy, to our security, 
and to our way of life. We need leadership from all parts of our 
society and government to tackle it, and we must do our part in the 
Senate. I look forward to having conversations across the aisle, to 
working together, to identifying real solutions to the challenges 
before us, and to creating new opportunities for America's workers.

863,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,25,Ms. STABENOW,"  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have often said healthcare is not 
political. It is personal, and there is no part of healthcare that is 
more personal than the decision if, when, and under what circumstances 
to have a child and who decides the medical course of action in a 
serious medical crisis.
  These decisions need to be made by women, their families, and their 
doctors. They should not be made by politicians who are more focused on 
their own political advantage rather than medical tragedies facing 
pregnant women at the end of pregnancy who want desperately to have a 
child.
  Our Republican friends know very well that nobody--and I mean 
nobody--in this Chamber supports infanticide. No one. In fact, in 2002, 
Congress voted unanimously--100 Members, including myself--to reaffirm 
that it is illegal, period. Suggesting otherwise is insulting and, 
frankly, disgusting, and it is beneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate.
  How dare the majority pretend to care about the health of women and 
children. If the Republican majority cares about the health of moms and 
their babies, why are you continuing to try to take their healthcare 
away? The President and the Republican majority have tried again and 
again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Let me remind you that before the Affordable Care Act, insurance 
companies could, and most of the time did, refuse to cover maternity 
care as basic healthcare for women, leaving parents with bills of tens 
of thousands of dollars for an uncomplicated birth.
  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I was proud to author 
the provision requiring maternity care in the Affordable Care Act. I 
remember the debate. I remember a very specific debate with a former 
colleague from Arizona, and I remember Republican efforts to strip that 
provision to cover maternity care from the Affordable Care Act. 
Fortunately, they were not successful. Now the administration is 
legalizing and offering junk insurance plans that treat being a woman 
as a preexisting condition again.
  One study found that none--none--of the newly approved plans cover 
maternity care. Maternity care is not a frill. It is basic healthcare 
for women, and if we are seeing more and more of these healthcare plans 
being put on the market, where women assume they are going to be 
covered and once again will not be, that is outrageous.
  Why aren't we passing a bill to guarantee that prenatal care and 
maternity care are covered for moms and babies as essential healthcare 
in every insurance plan? I assure you, this medical care is essential, 
and until parts of the Affordable Care Act began to be unwound by the 
administration, it was viewed as essential care for every woman.
  How dare you pretend to care about the health of women and children 
while voting to dramatically slash Medicaid and healthcare for low-
income working families. When you gut Medicaid, you are keeping moms 
and babies from getting the healthcare they need. In fact, Medicaid 
provided prenatal care and maternity care for 43 percent of American 
moms and babies born in 2016--43 percent. Why aren't we voting to 
strengthen Medicaid? Why aren't we voting to strengthen Medicaid 
healthcare for moms and babies? Why isn't that being brought to the 
floor?
  A few years ago, the Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill 
that I led with Senator Grassley called the Quality Care for Moms and 
Babies Act. This bill would create a set of maternal and infant quality 
care standards in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. 
The goal is simple: improving maternal and infant health outcomes. 
Shouldn't we all want to do that?
  Let me be clear. We have no uniform quality standards right now 
across the country for almost half of the births that occur every year. 
The Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act will help


make sure every mom--every mom--gets the best pregnancy care possible 
and every baby gets a healthy start. Why isn't that a top priority for 
action in the U.S. Senate, to protect the health of moms and babies?
  Let's also be clear. We have a real healthcare crisis that we need to 
address in this country. In most of the world, fewer and fewer women 
are dying from child birth but not in the United States. In fact, our 
maternal mortality rate is climbing. More women are dying, and our 
infant mortality rate ranks a shameful 32 out of 35 of the world's 
wealthiest nations. The United States of America is 32 out of 35 
countries--wealthiest countries in the world--in the number of infants 
that are dying in birth. That is something we need to have a sense of 
urgency to act on.
  There are a lot of things on healthcare. There are a lot of things to 
improve outcomes for children and moms and give them a healthy start 
and a healthy life that we should be doing right now, as well as 
stopping the administration from undermining basic healthcare for women 
and children. It is time to stop the cynical political stunts and start 
protecting--really protecting--the health of moms and babies.

867,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,29,Ms. HIRONO,"  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am glad to join Senator Stabenow, who 
was on the floor just now, to respond to the shameful lies and gross 
exaggerations that have been claimed by some on the other side of the 
aisle.
  Earlier this week, we voted on legislation that some of my colleagues 
claimed was needed to outlaw infanticide--the killing of babies. How 
absurd. It is, and has always been, illegal to kill any human, 
including infants.
  So what was in that legislation we voted on earlier this week? To 
honestly discuss the bill, we need to have a factually and medically 
accurate conversation about abortion.
  A healthy fetus becomes potentially able to live outside the womb at 
about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Very few abortions occur after that--less 
than 1 percent--and generally are performed either because the fetus 
has a fatal condition or the pregnant woman's life or health is at 
severe risk. These are heartbreaking situations involving very wanted 
pregnancies--hardly the time for the heavy hand of government to reach 
into our wombs.
  Under this bill, doctors will be required to resuscitate infants born 
with fatal conditions, even if the parents did not want these measures 
that could prolong their infant's suffering and instead wanted to spend 
the limited time they had with their baby comforting their child and 
holding them close.
  How dare anyone pretend to know what care is best for these families 
instead of trusting them and their doctors to decide. How dare Congress 
interject itself into a decision we have no business deciding for 
others. Yet this is exactly what this bill would have done.
  I encourage my colleagues to read stories from women who have been 
speaking up about their experiences with abortion later in pregnancy. 
These stories are usually found on the internet as well as in the 
national press, as more women feel under attack and are coming forward 
to tell their stories. Perhaps, in hearing from these women, my 
colleagues will realize what these women need is compassion, not 
condemnation.
  Stories like that of Dana Weinstein, who bravely told her story to 
CNN. Years ago, Dana and her husband learned at 31 weeks that their 
daughter's brain had a severe defect. Doctors told the couple their 
daughter would not be able to suck or swallow and would most likely 
suffer from uncontrollable seizures upon birth. They heard what a 
resuscitation order would entail. They listened to what an existence, 
short-lived or otherwise, would look like. They were briefed on hospice 
care.
  After the diagnosis, the kicks in Dana's belly, which had given her 
so much joy, became unbearable. She feared her daughter was seizing and 
may be suffering. Ultimately, Dana and her husband decided to get an 
abortion. For this baby they loved, it felt like--in their words--``a 
more peaceful path for her passing.''
  These are the stories. Compassion and understanding are what is 
needed in these instances, but instead of compassion, what my 
colleagues have offered this week is inflammatory political rhetoric 
and shaming and intimidating women and their providers who care for 
them in an attempt to score partisan points.
  President Trump--never missing an opportunity to score partisan 
points--weighed in on Twitter claiming that Senate Democrats ``don't 
mind executing babies after birth.''
  Today former Governor Scott Walker said to a crowd at the 
Conservative Political Action Conference that ``people are taking 
already-born babies from the hospital and aborting them there''--a 
comment that doesn't even make sense.
  Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, chimed in at the 
same conference, calling the choice that women like Dana make murder. 
These charges are false, incendiary, and this sort of language is 
intended to incite the Republican Party's base. It emboldens violence 
against abortion providers--violence which nearly doubled from 33 
reported death threats or threats of harm in 2016 to 62 in 2017, 
according to the National Abortion Federation.
  The hard truth is, the Republican Party hurts women. One of the ways 
they are doing this is by working as hard as they can to set up 
barriers or to eliminate entirely safe and legal abortions wherever 
they can.
  They demonize women who face the heartbreaking situation of needing 
an abortion later in pregnancy, oftentimes for medical reasons.
  They want to cut off crucial healthcare dollars to providers who even 
discuss abortion with patients. This is a gag rule that this 
administration is seeking to impose.
  They create loopholes to allow businesses to exclude coverage for 
contraception for workers, and to make sure that these and all of their 
other efforts stick, they pack the Federal courts with a line of 
aggressively anti-choice judges to uphold Federal Agency actions and 
State laws restricting abortion access.
  Doing the bidding of these rightwing ideologue supporters like the 
Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, Donald Trump has sent 
us judicial nominee after nominee with records of attacking a woman's 
right to choose as laid out in the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. 
Wade and restated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.
  These nominees come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I 
serve, and parrot the line provided for them by the Trump 
administration. When asked if they will respect precedent and uphold 
Roe v. Wade, they say they will ``follow the law.'' Then, when they get 
confirmed, they are in a position, with their lifetime appointments, to 
do exactly the opposite.
  The prime and most dangerous example of this kind of bait and switch 
is Brett Kavanaugh--a notoriously rightwing political lawyer appointed 
by George W. Bush to the second highest court in the United States--the 
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.
  Kavanaugh was not even on Donald Trump's original so-called short 
list of possible Supreme Court nominees--not the list released before 
the 2016 election and not the first list released thereafter. No, 
Kavanaugh only found a place on that list after he wrote a harsh 
dissent in a case involving a young refugee's right to an abortion.
  A minor, then 17 years old, was being kept in the custody of the 
Department of Health and Human Services because she had entered the 
United States without documentation. Where she was held in Texas, in 
order to access abortion services, a minor must have parental consent 
or receive permission from the judge. This is called a judicial 
bypass--to proceed without that parental consent.
  In this case, called Garza v. Hargan, the young woman did go through 
the process of going to court and receiving a judicial bypass. She had 
people willing and able to transport her and to


pay for the health services she needed, but the radical Trump appointee 
in charge, well known for his anti-abortion views, decided it would be 
in her best interest to find adult sponsors for her first, presumably 
to help her make a decision, but the Texas court had already decided 
she could make her own decision, and she did.
  She challenged the Trump appointee and his Agency, and ultimately a 
majority of the DC Circuit agreed with her that she had the legal right 
to an abortion and the Federal Government could not delay any further.
  Brett Kavanaugh, sitting on that circuit, disagreed and wrote a 
dissent, which must have captured the attention of those in charge of 
Donald Trump's Supreme Court short list because not long after his name 
appeared on that list.
  What did he write to earn his place on the list and eventually a 
nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court? He wrote a dissenting opinion 
that falsely characterized the Garza case as one about parental 
consent, which we know was not so because a judicial bypass was already 
in place.
  He wrote the dissent using the code words of the extreme anti-choice 
and anti-women wing of the Republican Party. He accused the majority on 
that court of creating ``a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in 
U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.'' He 
was wrong. There was no new right being created.
  He falsely claimed that by permitting the abortion ``[t]he majority's 
decision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court's abortion 
jurisprudence.'' He was wrong again. The majority decision was correct 
under Roe v. Wade.
  He wrote it was not an undue burden for this young woman to be 
prevented from getting an abortion until a sponsor family could be 
found for her. This was not even a legal argument, but he based his 
dissent on it. That is the dissent that moved Brett Kavanaugh to the 
head of the line on the short list for a nomination to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, where he sits.
  So when he came to the Judiciary Committee for a hearing, some 
Senators--myself included--were rightly skeptical that he would respect 
precedent if confirmed. At his hearing, Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein 
asked Judge Kavanaugh about Roe v. Wade and its status as settled 
precedent. He testified that Roe was ``settled as a precedent of the 
Supreme Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.''
  He further went on: ``Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirms Roe and 
did so by considering the stare decisis factors. So Casey now becomes a 
precedent on precedent.''
  It sure sounds like someone who will apply the precedents of Roe and 
Casey and others who rely on them, doesn't it? That is not so.
  The very first opportunity he got, Brett Kavanaugh, as Supreme Court 
Justice, voted against following precedent. Not 4 months after his 
confirmation, Justice Kavanaugh voted in the minority in a Supreme 
Court case called June Medical Services v. Gee to allow a restrictive, 
anti-abortion law in Louisiana to take effect.
  This law would have so restricted access to abortion that only one 
provider would have been left in the entire State of Louisiana of 4.7 
million people. Even Chief Justice Roberts voted with the majority to 
block the law. That is because it was clear from recent precedent in 
Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt that such restrictions don't meet 
constitutional standards.
  Justice Kavanaugh's cavalier attitude to the burden that he would put 
on a woman's ability to exercise their constitutional right is no 
surprise. His callous disregard for the way unwanted pregnancies can 
change the lives of women and children is not unexpected, and his 
willingness to hew to the party line of his supporters and ignore the 
assurances he gave the Senate is simply par for the course with Trump 
judicial nominees. This is what they do. It is an abuse of power, and 
women across the country are paying for it.
  Why do my colleagues across the aisle use this Chamber, time and 
again, to bring forward political shams that shame and retraumatize 
women who face profoundly heartbreaking situations? The will of over 
half of this country is 67 percent of Americans support Roe v. Wade and 
access to safe and legal abortion. Sixty-seven percent of Americans 
support a woman's right to choose.
  How is it that Republicans continue to bring forward bill after bill 
and amendment after amendment that goes against a constitutionally 
protected right of women--of women? This is why I say Republicans hurt 
women.
  I am proud of the vote I cast in opposition to the sham bill we voted 
on this week. My vote was rooted in fact and understanding about what 
an abortion in later pregnancy actually means. It was rooted in the 
understanding that when faced with these difficult situations, these 
decisions are best left to a woman and her doctor. These decisions 
should not rest with the U.S. Senate.
  My vote was cast with a clear understanding that if unchecked or 
unchallenged, this administration and this Senate will continue to 
assault a woman's right to choose and chip away at it bit by bit, where 
it will end up being a nullity, and that is what they want.
  I will continue to stand in opposition to attacks that seek to limit 
the personal freedom of women across the country and what would be more 
of a personal freedom for a woman than to exercise control over her own 
body?

                     Confirmation of Andrew Wheeler
",,2019-02-28
871,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,33,Mr. PETERS,"  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss why I voted in 
opposition to the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler for the position of 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
  Clean air and clean water are not only vital to our public health; 
they are at the very heart of our economy. Nowhere is that more 
apparent than in my home State of Michigan, where we are blessed to be 
surrounded by the Great Lakes, a source of drinking water for more than 
40 million people and the lifeblood of our State's multibillion-dollar 
fishing, shipping, and tourism industries. That is why I spent my 
entire career in public service fighting to protect our environment.
  In the Michigan State Senate, I worked to ban oil drilling under the 
Great Lakes to preserve our most precious source of drinking water. 
When I represented the city of Detroit in the House of Representatives, 
I fought to end harmful air pollution coming from piles of petcoke that 
left homes coated in dust while being breathed into the lungs of 
residents.
  In my first term in Congress, I supported landmark climate change 
legislation that sought to drastically reduce deadly greenhouse gas 
emissions that are continuing to warm our planet at an unsustainable 
rate. In the U.S. Senate, I led the charge to protect the Great Lakes 
from pipeline spills and pressured industry to cut down their deadly 
sulfur-dioxide emissions that give Michigan communities some of the 
highest rates of asthma anywhere in the country.
  I have championed these vital efforts because protecting our 
environment in Michigan is in the best interest of everyone, and I will 
never let up on that fight. There is so much more work to do and even 
more pressing challenges ahead of us. We cannot afford to turn back the 
clock on clean energy innovation or refuse to address climate change, 
and that is, unfortunately, what we can expect from the EPA now that 
Andrew Wheeler has been confirmed. His entire career has been devoted 
to undermining public health and environmental protections.
  As Acting EPA Administrator, he is personally responsible for the 
most significant efforts to roll back our Nation's bedrock 
environmental laws in the Agency's history. He oversaw the proposed 
rollback of Clean Water Act protections that safeguard drinking water 
for tens of millions of people. He is leading efforts to weaken 
standards on the largest sources of greenhouse gases and to reduce 
protections against climate change. When he was a Senate staffer, he 
drafted the so-called ``Clear


Skies Act,'' which was directly intended to undermine the Clean Air 
Act.
  As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Wheeler represented a company that 
didn't just knowingly violate environmental laws but consistently put 
its own employees' safety at risk by undermining basic protections for 
coal miners. He has even undermined the widely supported mercury and 
air toxics standards. These commonsense standards would have protected 
people, particularly children, from a well-known neurotoxin that 
impairs fetal brain development and reduces children's ability to 
learn.
  Every single one of these actions has a direct bearing on human lives 
and has put people at risk. In Michigan we have witnessed firsthand the 
visceral and painful human costs when public leaders fail to keep our 
drinking water and our air quality safe. Just ask the people of Flint 
whom they would want to have in charge of protecting their drinking 
water. I can tell you it certainly is not Andrew Wheeler. The city, the 
State, and the EPA all contributed to the crisis that poisoned 
thousands of children through lead exposure, and now those children 
will suffer lasting consequences for the rest of their lives.
  While I am proud that the Senate was able to come together to provide 
initial Federal funding to help Flint replace its lead pipes, the 
community needs continued support going forward. I am committed to 
doing everything in my power to ensure that the people of Flint are 
made whole, and that included my opposing this nomination. We cannot 
allow the failures of leadership that led to Flint's devastating crisis 
ever be repeated again.
  The people of Michigan and of every State deserve to know that their 
air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink. Yet 
communities across my State and around the country are facing another 
emerging drinking water crisis. This time it is from toxic fluorinated 
chemicals, known as PFAS, that are currently unregulated by the EPA. 
Rigorous testing has found that 1 out of every 10 water systems in my 
State has unacceptable high rates of PFAS chemicals. Families across 
the State have been exposed to these dangerous chemicals that have been 
linked to cancer, thyroid and heart problems, and even autoimmune 
issues. But under Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has failed to take 
aggressive action to list PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste and to 
establish strong and forcible limits to protect drinking water and to 
limit exposure to these toxic substances.
  While I work to bring Senate action to this issue through legislation 
and hearings, the Wheeler-led EPA thinks action can wait. Michigan 
families certainly deserve better. My constituents are understandably 
concerned about their drinking water, and they are rightfully skeptical 
about who will be at the helm of the Agency charged with keeping water 
safe.
  Since Wheeler has failed to exercise the leadership needed to address 
the environmental concerns we face on a national level, it is clear 
that he is completely unprepared to lead the Agency charged with 
tackling the global crisis of climate change. We must confront climate 
change. I have been advocating for action since before I ran for 
Congress. It is an issue impacting our economy, our health, our safety, 
and our national security. I am committed to continuing to work with my 
colleagues to find innovative and achievable solutions to address 
climate change, but we also need a leader at the EPA who can find 
commonsense ways to address this very serious threat, to protect our 
environment, and to ensure that our country can remain economically 
competitive. We need a leader who will fight to protect the people and 
the interests of my State. Given his abysmal record, it is clear that 
Andrew Wheeler isn't the right person for the job, and that is why I 
voted against his confirmation.

                        Tribute To Jean Pollard
",,2019-02-28
875,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1571-4,37,Mr. SULLIVAN,"  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, as you know, I try to come down to the 
floor every week to talk about someone in my State who is making a big 
difference in Alaska, a big difference in their country, and a big 
difference in what I believe is the best State in this country. That is 
just my opinion. I am sure the Presiding Officer thinks his State is 
the best in the country, but that is why we are all here in the Senate.
  Of course, Alaska is beautiful, particularly now as the snow is on 
the ground and the Sun is out. It is back out and high in the sky. It 
is also nearly time for the Iditarod--the last great race--something, I 
am sure, Senator Murkowski and I will be talking about on the floor in 
the coming weeks. It kicks off this weekend.
  We know it is a beautiful and amazing State, but what really makes 
Alaska such a great place are the people--the people who work 
tirelessly for causes they believe in.
  Many people don't know this, but Alaska is also incredibly diverse. 
In fact, Anchorage--my hometown and the State's largest city--is home 
to the country's three most diverse census tracks, racially and in 
terms of nationalities. By the way, the fourth is Queens, NY.
  I will just give you an example. Last week, we had this great event 
called Bridge Builders. It was in Anchorage. There were all of these 
different ethnic communities in Anchorage coming together. I spent a 
lot of time there on Saturday.
  We are very proud of our diversity. We are proud that more than 100 
languages are spoken in our schools. Think about that if you want to 
talk about diversity. We are proud of the foods and the cultural 
events. We are proud of the unique tapestry that makes up Alaska.
  We are very proud of our history, and we are also blessed to have 
people who work diligently for all of us to keep history alive. I can 
think of no better way to cap off Black History Month than to recognize 
someone who, for years, has been fiercely determined to unearth a very 
important part of Alaska's history--actually, a very important part of 
America's history--one that transpired in my State but that greatly 
influenced our Nation during a very critical time.
  I want to introduce you to Ms. Jean Pollard. She is our Alaskan of 
the Week. Jean has brought back the story of the African-American Army 
Engineers of the 93rd, 95th, and 97th regiments who were in the U.S. 
Army during World War II and stationed in Alaska during World War II.
  More than 3,000 of these brave soldiers were integral in Alaska in 
building what we call the Alcan Highway--the Alaska-Canada Highway--one 
of the 20th century's greatest engineering feats.
  Let me tell you about Ms. Pollard. Now a retired schoolteacher, she 
grew up in Georgia. When she was a teenager, her father, who was in the 
Army, got transferred to Alaska. Like all Alaskan students--like our 
good students, our pages in the Senate--she took a class on her State's 
history--Alaska history--in high school.
  During the class, she learned about how the Army built the Alcan 
Highway in 1942 to help defend Alaska and America from invasion by 
Japan. A lot of people don't know this. Yes, Alaska was invaded and 
occupied by the Japanese military during World War II in the Aleutian 
Islands. I am going to talk about that a little bit more.
  She learned about this in high school. It was a good story, but the 
most important element she was taught in high school was actually left 
out. The highway was only able to be finished because of the more than 
3,000 African-American soldiers who built it.
  So after getting a master's degree in education and a minor in 
history and after being a teacher for decades, Ms. Pollard only learned 
the entire story herself when she was sitting home one Friday night 
watching a PBS documentary about the building of this incredible 
highway.

  What did she learn? Again, let's go back in time. It is March 1942, 3 
months after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. As the war effort was 
heating up, construction began on a 1,700-mile-long vital link 
connecting the great State of Alaska--it wasn't a State then; it was a 
territory--to the lower 48 for the war effort.
  Soon a massive mobilization followed--about 10,000 Army troops. Huge


trucks, civil engineers, food, tents, you name it, were deployed to 
start building this road.
  Then, in June 1942, the Japanese invaded Attu and Kiska Islands in 
the Aleutian Islands chain of Alaska, adding a new sense of urgency to 
the completion of the road.
  These soldiers worked day and night--200 bridges, 800 culverts, 
through some of the most rugged terrain on planet Earth, mountains, 
rivers, no rest, hard, backbreaking work--and they were able to 
complete this 1,700-mile road that still exists today--some of you may 
have driven it--in less than a year.
  When the road was being built, the military was still segregated, and 
African Americans in the Army--much like in the rest of the country--
were treated as second-class citizens. They were assigned to the 
toughest jobs on this project, using the worst equipment. In the 
summer, it was full of mosquitoes, black flies, mud, and swamps.
  Winter comes early in Alaska. According to the historian, Lael 
Morgan, the winter of 1942 was considered one of the worst winters on 
record since 1906 in terms of how cold it was--and, trust me, it gets 
cold in Alaska--and how much snow there was.
  The Black troops were required to build winter barracks for the White 
soldiers, while the African-American troops lived in tents. When the 
snow fell, they couldn't get supplies, and some nearly starved to 
death, Lael wrote. It is reported that some even succumbed to injuries 
due to the cold--fatalities due to the cold.
  They did so much of the hard work. However, the contribution of these 
great African-American soldiers and heroes were completely almost 
scrubbed from all of the history books. Nobody that Ms. Pollard spoke 
to--social studies teachers or history professors--knew anything about 
this history.
  In Ms. Pollard's words: ``They stole that history.'' The history 
books wouldn't write it. It was wrong, and she knew she had to make it 
right so she went to work.
  As a teacher herself and a lifelong learner, she knew that bringing 
the story to the school system was key to keeping our history alive--
accurate history. Eventually, she called the historian I spoke about, 
Lael Morgan--a former Alaskan who was then living in Maine and happened 
to be featured in that documentary that Ms. Pollard watched on that 
Friday evening.
  Lael decided to help in a big way. Incredibly, a year later, she sold 
her house in Maine and headed up the Alcan Highway to Alaska. Together, 
and with the help of a team of others Ms. Pollard recruited, they 
amassed enough material to give to the school system to set the history 
right.
  Now schools across Alaska are putting this story--this real story--
into their curriculum, and now she is trying to get it required as part 
of a course that the university students in Alaska who are studying 
education have to take.
  She and her team put calls out across the internet for anyone who was 
involved in or had a relative involved in building the highway. She was 
able to track down three members of the African-American Army Engineers 
who were still alive. She flew to interview one of the soldiers who was 
100 years old. Another one, who lives in Louisiana, traveled to Alaska 
in 2017 for the 75th anniversary of the highway's completion.
  Recently, Ms. Pollard mentioned the names of the soldiers she spoke 
to back then. There was a soldier from Virginia, SGT Reginald Beverly, 
who, unfortunately, has now passed away. The soldier in Louisiana who 
came to Alaska in 2017 is Private Leonard Larkins. He has 10 children. 
The Alaska Highway Project will be bringing him and his three sons back 
to Alaska on August 3 to help him celebrate his 99th birthday.
  I am in the process of drafting a Senate resolution to recognize all 
of the members of the African-American Army Engineers who helped build 
the Alcan Highway, which was so critical to protecting our Nation and 
Alaska.
  Ms. Pollard describes herself as feisty. Others might describe her as 
fiercely determined. When the Alaska State Legislature, at her urging, 
passed a resolution commemorating these African-American soldiers who 
built one of the greatest engineering highways in the world, she was 
sitting behind some of the State legislators.
  She heard one whisper to another: Have you met this Jean Pollard?
  The other said: Yes, she calls me several times a day about this 
bill.
  Julie and I were just with Ms. Pollard this past weekend, as I 
mentioned, at the Bridge Builder event in Anchorage--my wife Julie and 
I. She is very passionate, very persuasive, and we are very proud of 
her.
  Ms. Pollard and the team that created the Alaska Highway Memorial 
Project are on another mission to erect a memorial in a park in 
Anchorage. They have the design, and they certainly have the will with 
her driving it, and I have no doubt they will get it done to 
memorialize this great engineering feat by American heroes who were not 
treated well by their country.
  Like the story of how Ms. Pollard brought important history back to 
our State, the story of building the Alcan and of the civil rights in 
the military also has an uplifting message.
  On October 25, 1942, less than 8 months after they started, two 
soldiers, one African American and one White, shook hands after 
completing this highway. Six years later, President Harry S. Truman 
ordered the Army desegregated, 16 years before the passage of the Civil 
Rights Act. Many historians now cite the work and the experience on 
this Alcan Highway project, and the African-American soldiers and White 
soldiers working together on a really difficult challenge, as also 
helping make that possible--civil rights, 16 years later.
  The Federal Highway Administration calls the Alcan Highway the road 
to civil rights. Isn't that a great depiction?
  So, Ms. Pollard, thank you and your team for bringing that history 
back to us. I am proud to have talked a little bit about that important 
history for Alaska and America on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Congratulations for being our Alaskan of the Week.

  That is why I am proud to introduce the SAVE Act. This is bipartisan 
legislation that would help States establish State-based exchanges that 
would increase access and drive down costs.
  These are solutions that we know work. States with State-based 
exchanges have higher enrollment rates and more affordable coverage.
  Right now, there are a number of States that haven't set up their own 
exchanges. That is tens of millions of people, including millions of 
people throughout New Jersey, who stand to benefit.

879,DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgS1569-2,0,Mr. ALEXANDER,"  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, President Trump has been in Vietnam 
this week, meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. I applaud 
the President for his efforts to improve the U.S. relationship with 
North Korea.
  There is not a more difficult relationship anywhere in the world at 
this time than that relationship. But I am glad he chose not to seek a 
deal just for the sake of a deal.
  As he returns from his summit with the North Korean leader and turns 
his attention back home, I want to make a respectful suggestion, and 
that is this: that President Trump ask his lawyers to take a second 
look at existing funding authorities that the President has to consider 
construction of the 234 miles of border wall that do not require a 
formal declaration of a national emergency.
  I support what the President wants to do on border security, but I do 
not support the way he has been advised to do it. It is unnecessary and 
unwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis about 
separation of powers when the President already has congressional 
funding authority to build the 234 miles of border wall that he 
requested in his January 6 letter to the Senate.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record 
following my remarks the text of the President's January 6 letter to 
the Senate Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. President, there has never been an instance in which a President 
of the United States has asked for funding, Congress has refused it, 
and the President has then used the National Emergency Act to justify 
spending the money anyway.
  If President Trump can build a wall when Congress has refused to 
provide the funding, then the next President can declare a national 
emergency and tear the wall down or declare climate change an emergency 
and stop oil exports and offshore drilling. There is no limit to the 
imagination of what the next leftwing President could do to harm our 
country with this precedent.
  After an American revolution against a King, our Founders chose not 
to create a Chief Executive who could tax the people and spend their 
money any way he chose. The Constitution gave that responsibility 
exclusively to a Congress elected by the people, and every one of us 
U.S. Senators has taken an oath to support that Constitution.
  Separation of powers is a crucial constitutional imperative that goes 
to the very heart of our freedom.
  I don't know how the late Justice Antonin Scalia would have decided a 
case on this matter, but I do know what he said about separation of 
powers, and this was what Justice Scalia said:

       Every tin horn dictator in the world today . . . has a Bill 
     of Rights. That's not what makes us free. . . . What has made 
     us free is our Constitution. . . . The word ``constitution'' 
     . . . means structure. That's why . . . the framers debated 
     not the Bill of Rights . . . but rather the structure of the 
     federal government. The genius of the American constitutional 
     system is the dispersal of power. Once power is centralized 
     in one person, or one part [of our government], a Bill of 
     Rights is just words on paper.

  That was Justice Scalia.
  The President can avoid this dangerous precedent completely. He can 
use the congressional funding authority he already has to build the 234 
miles of wall that he asked Congress to approve in the January 6 letter 
that I submitted for the Record.
  Here is how this would work. On January 6 of this year--last month--
in his letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the President 
requested $5.7 billion to build 234 miles of new physical barrier on 
the southern border.
  Then, on February 14, a couple of weeks ago, Congress passed the 
Homeland Security appropriations bill, which provided $1.375 billion to 
build 55 miles that the President had asked for.
  On February 15, the day he signed the Homeland Security 
appropriations bill, President Trump announced that he would use two 
additional sources of funds that had already been approved by Congress, 
which could be used to fund the border wall.
  The first was $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. The 
second was up to $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense accounts 
to support counterdrug activities and to block drug-smuggling corridors 
across international boundaries.
  The President is authorized to do this because of a provision in law 
that allows him to transfer up to $4 billion among the accounts of the 
Department of Defense. That is $4 billion in a Department of Defense 
budget of about $600 billion.
  These three sources of funding that I just mentioned add up to about 
$4.5 billion or $1.2 billion less than the $5.7 billion that the 
President requested in his January 6 letter.
  So where does he get the rest of the money? He can get it by 
transferring $3.7 billion instead of $2.5 billion from the Department 
of Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities. Then the 
President would be able to build the 234 miles of wall he requested on 
January 6, and he would not need to declare a national emergency.
  To be specific, this means the President would use $1.375 billion 
from the Homeland Security appropriations bill plus $601 million from 
the Treasury Forfeiture Fund plus $3.7 billion from the Department of 
Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities, which would add up 
to equal his full $5.7 billion request to build 234 miles of border 
wall.
  If my analysis is incorrect, I hope that the President's lawyers will 
tell me.
  Using funds already approved by Congress avoids the constitutional 
crisis of separation of powers. Using funds already approved by 
Congress avoids establishing a dangerous precedent, which could be 
misused by subsequent Presidents. Using funds already approved by 
Congress avoids taking money from military construction projects 
specifically approved by Congress for such activities as military


barracks and hospitals. And using funds already approved by Congress 
avoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely that 
the full 234 miles are ever built.
  It may be a couple of weeks before the Senate votes on a resolution 
regarding the national emergency declaration, so we don't know yet 
exactly what we will be voting on. There is time for the President's 
lawyers to take another look and determine whether we can both build 
the 234 miles of border wall that the President has asked for and avoid 
this dangerous precedent. Then the Senate could both support the 
President's border request and be faithful to our oath to support a 
Constitution that creates separation of powers as a crucial check on 
Executive power that goes to the very heart of our freedom.",A000360,2019-02-28

People's Missionary Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas will celebrate Mrs. 
Willie C. Woodson on the occasion of her 100th birthday.
  Mrs. Woodson was born in Burneysville, Oklahoma, on February 19, 
1919--the third of fourteen children. She and her older brother, 
Thomas, were often tasked with caring for their younger siblings on top 
of school work. Shortly after starting the ninth grade at a local high 
school in Ardmore, Oklahoma, Mrs. Woodson's family came under hard 
times that left her without money to pay for books or school lunches. 
She was left with no choice but to forego her remaining years in school 
and focus on her family, her community, and her faith.
  Upon her move to Dallas, Mrs. Woodson joined the People's Missionary 
Baptist Church and has been a devout member ever since. As one of the 
eldest active members of the church and a known mentor to all, she is 
commonly referred to as `Mother Woodson' by family and friends alike. 
No matter how busy she is, she always makes the time to attend church 
every Sunday morning. She especially loves to attend the service on the 
first Sunday of the month because she enjoys sitting with the church's 
Mothers Board in their assigned row, dressed in white.
  Mrs. Woodson refuses to let the limitations of old age stop her from 
a full schedule of activities. She has many hobbies that fill her free 
time, including reading, watching wrestling and cheering on the local 
Dallas sports teams. She also still prepares all of her meals and 
cleans the house on her own.
  Madam Speaker, I want to commend Mrs. Willie C. Woodson for a life 
dedicated to her family, friends and church and want to wish her the 
happiest of birthdays. Congratulations are in order for her and her 
family as they celebrate this extraordinary milestone.

886,TRIBUTE TO HARVEY SCALES,CREC-2019-02-28-pt1-PgE233,0,Ms. MOORE,"  Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my deepest condolences to 
Mrs. Rochella Scales and her family on the loss of Milwaukee's 
``Godfather of Soul'', Harvey Scales. Harvey was born in Osceola, 
Arkansas, on September 27, 1941, and passed away on February 11, 2019. 
He was a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, relative and 
friend to many here in Milwaukee and around the world.
  Harvey's family moved to Milwaukee when he was a young child where 
his father found work at American Motors. He attended both Roosevelt 
Junior High and North Division High Schools. For over 60 years, Harvey 
Scales has entertained us all beginning as a teen with doo wop bands in 
the 50's with such renowned Milwaukee contemporaries as the late Al 
Jarreau until he ultimately formed the band, Harvey Scales and the 
Seven Sounds in 1961. Harvey Scales and the Seven Sounds' first gig was 
at the Wisconsin State Fair. Harvey was able to perform in places in 
Milwaukee and Wisconsin where African Americans were not allowed and 
sought to break barriers through his music by playing at venues that 
drew an integrated crowd.
  He was signed at various record labels over the years including the 
legendary soul labels of Chess and Stax. Harvey was signed by 
Casablanca Records after co-writing the platinum-selling song ``Disco 
Lady'' in 1976 for Johnny Taylor. In fact, it would be the biggest hit 
of Taylor's career, and the first song certified as platinum by the 
Recording Industry Association of America. Casablanca Records released 
Harvey's albums ``Confidential Affair'' in 1978 and ``Hot Foot: A 
Funque Dizco Opera'' in 1979.
  Harvey proved himself to be more than an entertainer; he was also a 
person who endeavored to unite everyone through the love of music. He 
was both a social and a fun person to be around; he had friends 
throughout the industry including MC Hammer and the late Aretha 
Franklin to name but a few. Harvey continued to perform well into his 
70s; in fact, one of his last shows was at Summerfest in 2017. The 
songs he wrote would be later sampled and recorded by a new generation 
of musicians including the Beastie Boys and Pete Rock.
  Harvey leaves family and friends to cherish his memory including his 
wife Rochella Scales; Children: Tonya Stoudermire, David Vela, Daniel 
Vela, Dorothea Felder, Theresa Sheppard, Rodney Sheppard, Cornell 
Scales, Eric Scales, Harvey Scales, Jr., Jewel Henry, Kim Brown, 
Michael Brown, Rochelle Brown, Michelle Brown, and Bobby Brown; 40 
grandchildren and a host of other relatives.
  Harvey Scales, my friend and fellow Blue Devil will be greatly missed 
because of the positive impact he left on the lives of so many. While 
his death leaves a huge void, he will be remembered for his lifetime as 
a music artist who continues to inspire future generations. The legacy 
of his music continues with his son, Harvey Scales, Jr., rapper JR 
Scalez who collaborated with his father, as well as, the many musicians 
who continue to both perform and record his music.
  Madam Speaker, Harvey Scales has positively impacted the 4th 
Congressional District, the State of Wisconsin and the world. As family 
and friends gather to remember and celebrate the life of this loving 
and remarkable man; I applaud him and his legacy.

being a Member of the House of Representatives.
  I also am speaking without notes because, over 40 years ago, I lost a 
teenage friend of mine just a few yards from my front door in what was 
perhaps one of the first drive-bys in the history of Los Angeles, a 
senseless killing where a young man on drugs decided to shoot through a 
wall of someone's home--my friend's home. With one shot, Rudy died at 
the age of 16.
  Today, I had the honor and the privilege of voting on a bill that 
would make our streets safer--not solve every problem, but reduce the 
amount of crying and dying that goes on in too many communities around 
America.
  I must say this--and it is unfortunate to have to clarify--because I 
am Latino, people are assuming that the person who shot Rudy was a 
Latino or a Black male or what have you. He was not. He was a young 
man--a victim, himself, of drug abuse--a White young man.
  It should never happen to anyone, and people should never assume that 
it only happens to certain people in certain communities. Tens of 
thousands of human lives are lost every year in the greatest country, 
America, and we need to make it better.

for equality like the Rainwater Family of Carrollton, Texas during this 
Black History Month. Over the last 100 years, each generation of the 
Rainwater family has persistently worked to grow Carrollton, Texas, 
into a diverse, inclusive, and loving community.
  Born on February 3, 1912, Annie Heads Rainwater was the sixth child 
of Walter and Nancy Heads. In 1932, Annie married Charlie ``Wash'' 
Rainwater, son of George W. Rainwater and Delia Bush. Annie and Charlie 
had eight children, two of which passed away as infants. Annie and 
Charlie lived on the family farm belonging to Annie's grandparents--
located in present day Carrollton, Texas. Annie was a homemaker and 
Charlie managed the family farm. Together, they attended church and 
spent time instilling Christian values of charity, hard work, and 
friendship in their children.
  In 1962, Dallas' school district desegregation plan was slowly being 
put into place. In Carrollton, a then-rural school district to the 
northwest, Annie Heads Rainwater's six children had no neighborhood 
high school. Under segregation laws and as was customary, black 
students were not allowed to attend the all-white Carrollton High 
School just minutes away from the Rainwater family farm. Black students 
were bused 20 miles to all-black Booker T. Washington High School in 
Dallas, and later, 30 miles north to Denton's all-black Fred Moore 
High.
  To Mrs. Rainwater, the school system had failed her family. As a 
recent widow, Mrs. Rainwater filed civil action in U.S. District Court 
against Carrollton's school district, demanding desegregation. Her 
younger daughters, Nancy and Betty, were named as plaintiffs in the 
case. Later that year, Judge Sarah T. Hughes ordered Carrollton to 
integrate its high school. In fall 1963, Mrs. Rainwater watched as 
Nancy and other teenagers became the first black students to attend 
all-white R.L. Turner High School in Carrollton, Texas. Annie Heads 
Rainwater lived until 1992. In 1994, the Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD 
recognized Annie for her bold perseverance against many odds by 
dedicating Annie Heads Rainwater Elementary in her honor.
  Today, Annie Heads Rainwater's son, Rev. Willie Rainwater, continues 
to carry the torch for justice and freedom through his work at Christ 
Community Connection. Willie and his wife, Juanita, work diligently to 
provide scholarships to underprivileged students in Carrollton-Farmers 
Branch ISD. Additionally, Willie and Juanita started the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. parade that celebrated its 25th anniversary last month.
  Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the 
Rainwater Family for their significant contributions to the Carrollton, 
Texas community.

Kansas City, Kansas, as a national commemorative site. I would also 
like to thank Senator Pat Roberts for his important leadership on this

  The bill that passed this week honors the significant history of 
Quindaro, which served as a key stop on the Underground Railroad and 
helps preserve the site for future generations.
  Quindaro is an important part of United States and Kansas history in 
the fight for freedom and equality. It serves as a reminder of a dark 
chapter in our Nation's history.
  Sadly, for too long, the Quindaro Townsite has lacked proper 
investments needed to preserve it as a historic site. But the community 
leaders in Kansas never gave up on fighting for Quindaro, people like 
Marvin Robinson a Kansas City, Kansas, native who spent over 30 years

not address the serious issue of illegal gun transfers.
  Madam Speaker, criminals do not follow the law. According to the 
Department of Justice, 77 percent of State prison inmates convicted of 
a firearm crime either obtain their firearm through theft, off the 
black market, from a drug dealer, or on the street.

instead, and infringe upon Second Amendment gun rights. I urge my

Bill, kept asking Marlee: What is your wish with Make-A-Wish?
  After a few weeks, sweet Marlee answered: ``Dad, if I have to think 
about it this hard, I don't need a wish.''
  Marlee turned Make-A-Wish into make a gift. She opened Marlee's Bear 
Workshop and partnered with Build-A-Bear to give kids with cancer teddy 
bears and hope.
  Thank you, Bill and Shelly, and all who loved Marlee for giving us 
such a special person. She made our world better.

899,CLOSING BACKGROUND CHECK LOOPHOLE IS LIFE SUPPORT,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-2,0,Mr. DOGGETT,"  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, selling a gun to a convicted felon, to a 
perpetrator of domestic violence, to a fugitive from justice, merits a 
jail term, but those who oppose this reasonable background check bill 
are enabling just that.
  Someone who couldn't buy a .22 inside a gun shop can, today, go 
outside that shop and buy a military-style killing machine and get away 
with it.
  Doctors Seth Goldstein and Lisa Epstein, who visited my office this 
very week on behalf of Moms Demand Action, and 117 San Antonio 
physicians, they have a view that is different from Members of Congress 
concerning the result of gun violence. They witness this violence in 
the emergency room after young bodies are torn apart.
  What a different view this debate would have if it were occurring 
amidst the pain, violence, and blood in a hospital emergency room, 
because closing this loophole is about life support.
  We have got to end the trauma. Let's join the doctors who are out 
there seeking to save lives and do our part to save lives by passing 
this bill.

901,NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2237-5,1,Mrs. RODGERS of Washington,"  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the 
President's national emergency declaration.
  First and foremost, I support President Trump, and I support the 
wall. Walls work to protect our security, combat human trafficking, 
stop the flow of drugs, and encourage legal immigration.
  Democrats have pushed for zero wall money, open borders, and 
abolishing ICE. These policies make our Nation vulnerable and threaten 
our security, and it is a tragedy.
  So I don't blame the President for proposing extreme measures to 
respond to their extreme policies and tactics. However, yesterday, I 
made the difficult decision to disapprove of this type of unilateral 
executive action, just as I could not approve any such unilateral 
action by any President.
  I am 100 percent with President Trump for building the wall, but the 
emergency declaration only maintains the status quo. Securing our 
border is fundamental to who we are as a sovereign nation, and that is 
why I voted over a dozen times for stronger border security, including 
$25 billion for the wall last year.


  Unfortunately, as the President recognized, himself, this national 
emergency could be tied up in the courts for years with no guarantee 
that judges will rule in favor of the wall to be built. It is Congress' 
job to provide the resources our Nation needs to keep us safe, and I am 
concerned that if this is tied up in the courts, we will be stuck with 
the status quo of no wall and a border that isn't secure.
  My vote to disapprove of this unilateral executive action had nothing 
to do with the merits or need to build President Trump's wall; it was 
about our Constitution and this body's exclusive Article I powers to 
make laws and use the power of the purse.
  I spoke out strongly when President Obama said that if Congress 
didn't act, he would use the pen and the phone, and then he proceeded 
to act alone on DACA and act alone in reappropriating money within 
ObamaCare and regulating every mud puddle in America.
  Remember, President Obama initially said he couldn't act alone on 
DACA because he wasn't a king or an emperor. After a robust debate in 
Congress, he flip-flopped and took executive action. His executive 
action took away Congress' authority to act, and DACA still isn't 
solved.
  These unilateral actions by President Obama put more power in the 
hands of unelected people sitting in cubicles in Washington, D.C., and 
they turned elected Representatives into elected bystanders. When 
Representatives become irrelevant, citizens become irrelevant, and we 
the people are powerless against faceless, unelected bureaucrats.
  Unilateral executive actions set bad precedent. If it is okay for the 
executive branch to act alone after the legislative branch doesn't 
reach an agreement, where does that take us?
  Governor Jay Inslee already has said that he would be willing to 
declare a national emergency on climate change allowing for drastic 
Federal action that would never have to be approved by Congress.
  What if, without any congressional approval, a future President used 
a national emergency to take money from our VA clinics, Fairchild Air 
Force Base, or force management at the Colville National Forest to 
force a Green New Deal on the American people?
  Whether it is at the border or upholding the separation of powers in 
our Constitution, we, conservative Republicans, must be consistent 
about being the party for the rule of law. It is those principles that 
define us.
  Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker Pelosi: I am 100 percent with Trump on 
the wall. I am also 100 percent with the Constitution. As 
Representatives of the people, it is our call to put aside any personal 
ambition or partisan divides so that the people are protected.
  This isn't about political parties, personalities, or power. It never 
has been. It is about making sure that the promise of America is never 
breached and knowing that the only ones who can preserve it are we the 
people. I take this seriously and will always lead by upholding my 
Article I constitutional authority to be a strong voice for those I 
have the privilege of serving in the United States House of 
Representatives.

902,TRIBUTE TO HENRY LEE JONES,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE225-3,0,Ms. MOORE,"  Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a man of faith, 
Henry Lee Jones. He was a husband, father, grandfather and entrepreneur 
from the Fourth Congressional District of Wisconsin. Henry Lee Jones 
was born on July 19, 1943 in Aberdeen, Mississippi to the union of 
Elloyd and Rohdana Jones and passed away on February 18, 2019.
  Mr. Jones moved to Milwaukee in his late teens and was employed by A. 
O. Smith as a welder for 12 years. In 1975, Henry and Bobbie's Bungalow 
was established on the corners of 14th Street and Keefe Avenue in 
Milwaukee. The restaurant featured specialties such as a variety of 
soul food, BBQ seafood and scrumptious desserts. The Bungalow's 
signature dessert is peach cobbler.
  The Bungalow Restaurant provided catering services to many 
individuals in the community, as well as businesses and organizations. 
One of the most famous organizations he catered to was the Green Bay 
Packer franchise. In fact, as quoted in the Shepherd Express Newspaper, 
``The authenticity of Bungalow's Southern-styled menu heavy on pork, 
chicken, beef and fish has even captured the attention of the Green Bay 
Packers. Members of the Green & Gold have had Bungalow employees truck 
their soulful grub to Green Bay for many years now. Whether ordered 
from Lambeau Field or the Bungalow's cozy brick building, options 
abound. You'll find relatively rare dishes such as oxtails and smoked 
ham hocks in addition to more common fare like fried chicken, steak and 
catfish. And though the Bungalow staff takes pride in making healthy 
meat and sides, including yams, turnip greens and okra, one can still 
order ``gravy, gravy and more gravy.'' Even if you don't spot a Packer 
on a day you visit this establishment, you can still enjoy the many 
autographed photos on the walls.
  As a successful entrepreneur, he was inspired to expand his business 
to other locations across the city of Milwaukee and Kenosha. He was 
never a complainer but rather a doer. Mr. Jones' children share his 
passion and continue to carry on his legacy and business.
  He married Bobbie Jones on July 29, 1967 and their union was blessed 
with 5 sons: Henry, Jr., Milton, Rodney, Demetrius and Lavial. Henry 
was preceded in death by his parents. He leaves many family and friends 
to cherish his memory including his wife Bobbie Jones and Children: 
Mitch Malone, Richard Jones, Henry Jones Jr., Milton Jones. Demetrius 
(Nichole) Jones and Lavial Jones; Siblings: Dorothy (John) Williams, 
Delores Tools, Elloyd (Parline) Jones, Yvonne Jones; Grandchildren: 
Latoya (Emmanuel) Amoah, Deaquann Forrest, Vegas Jones, Naytosha Jones, 
Xavier Jones, Corey Malone, Britany Malone, Marcus Malone and Cortez 
Malone; 6 great grandchildren and a host of nieces, nephews and other 
relatives.
  Henry had a significant impact on the community who not only enjoyed 
his cooking but his loving and joking spirit as well. He was a pillar 
of the community, the patriarch of his family. I have known Mr. Jones 
for over 30 years, well before I began my legislative career and he was 
my friend. He has made a positive impact on Milwaukee and it is truly 
an honor for me to pay homage to someone who has contributed so much to 
Milwaukee and the State of Wisconsin.
  Madam Speaker, for these reasons I rise to pay tribute to a man whose 
legacy will continue to benefit the Fourth Congressional District.

Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is dedicated to making our world a 
better and safer world.
  Ashley and Chris Gasperi, ER nurses, were residents of Feasterville 
and worked at Temple University Hospital and St. Mary Medical Center. 
Despite dedicating their careers to caring for others, they both craved 
more and later decided to move to Kenya to establish a nonprofit 
organization that seeks to break the vicious cycle of poverty in rural 
communities.
  Together, they established Ekenywa. Ekenywa works to dig wells, 
sometimes hundreds of feet deep, to establish a reliable water source 
to communities and schools in rural Kenya. The creation of these wells 
allows for solar-powered irrigation systems, enabling communities to 
farm year-round, even in the presence of a drought.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of the Gasperi family and Ekenywa. 
They are truly making a difference in the lives of countless people 
across the world.
  I speak on behalf of our entire Bucks County community when we tell 
them how much we appreciate their service and their sacrifice.

citizen in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently was recognized in a 
national science competition.
  Walker Anderson, a Doylestown resident and a senior at Central Bucks 
West High School, recently won $2,000 as a semifinalist for the 
Regeneron Science Talent Search competition. This recognition was 
received by only 300 students nationwide and only four in the State of 
Pennsylvania.
  As impressive as this may be on its own, this is only one academic 
achievement of Walker's. Walker previously placed first in the under-18 
category at the World Puzzle Championship in Prague, competing on the 
U.S. team, and was recently accepted into the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology.
  Mr. Speaker, I am sure we will hear of Walker well into the future, 
as his STEM research and grasp of complex mathematical and scientific 
concepts is truly remarkable.
  I wish Walker and his parents, Susan and Ken Anderson, all of the 
best. I also thank Mark Hayden, Walker's STEM Research Club adviser, 
for his guidance and his vision.

908,INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NON-DISCRIMINATION HOME RULE ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE217-4,0,Ms. NORTON,"  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I introduce the District of 
Columbia Non-Discrimination Home Rule Act of 2019 to end the unique 
applicability of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 
(RFRA) to the District of Columbia. My bill would protect the 
District's right to self-government, ensuring the District is treated 
the same as states, and defend LGBTQ and reproductive rights in D.C.
  RFRA, which provides more protection for religious exercise than the 
First Amendment requires, applies to the federal government, the D.C. 
government and the territorial governments, but not to state 
governments. As RFRA does not apply to the states, under the principles 
of home rule, it should likewise not apply to the District.
  While RFRA was designed to be a shield to protect religious freedom, 
it is being used, as evidenced by the Supreme Court's 2014 Hobby Lobby 
decision, as a sword to discriminate against the LGBTQ community and 
women. Members of Congress have used RFRA as a justification for 
trying--but failing--to overturn D.C. antidiscrimination laws. House 
Republicans have repeatedly tried since 2015 to nullify or block the 
District's Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act (RHNDA), which 
prohibits employers from discriminating against employees and their 
families based on reproductive health decisions, claiming, in part, 
that it violates RFRA. However, it appears that no one has challenged 
RHNDA's legality under RFRA in court.
  My bill ensures that District residents are treated the same as 
residents of the states under RFRA. I strongly urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation.

that makes me proud of this Chamber. After years of inaction, Congress 
is moving to address our country's gun violence problem.
  We have seen some of the worst mass shootings in our Nation's history 
in just the past few years. Las Vegas, Thousand Oaks, Sutherland 
Springs, Parkland, Sandy Hook--these are only a few of the names that 
recently shocked us to the core. And, sadly, each time, Congress failed 
to act.
  But today--today--we are offering more than thoughts and prayers. We 
are offering legislation. This bill has bipartisan support--finally, 
something we can all agree on.
  Strengthening our background check system is a small but a very 
important first step. We simply cannot allow criminals to take 
advantage of loopholes.
  Background checks work. They keep guns out of the hands of criminals, 
and background checks will save lives.

911,SUPPORTING GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LEGISLATION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE223-4,0,Mr. KING of New York,"  Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act. Both pieces of legislation would close deadly 
loopholes in federal law to increase public safety. I am proud to co-
lead these important initiatives to reduce gun violence.
   H.R. 8, which would require background checks on all firearm 
purchases, is a common sense measure that will help keep our children 
and communities safe. This is particularly important with the rise of 
internet and gun show sales, where prohibited purchasers can easily 
skirt the law to obtain deadly firearms. This bill would also reduce 
firearms trafficking through secondary sales and enhance law 
enforcement's ability to trace firearms used in a crime.
   Similarly, H.R. 1112 would increase public safety by giving 
background check operators sufficient time to complete background 
checks.


While roughly 90 percent of background checks on gun sales are 
completed immediately, a small amount requires additional time for 
operators to discern whether a purchaser is prohibited from buying a 
firearm. However, under current law, if a background check is not 
completed within three business days, the sale can proceed. This 
loophole allows thousands of prohibited purchasers each year--including 
the shooter in Charleston, South Carolina--from obtaining guns without 
the completion of a background check.
   H.R. 1112 would keep everyday citizens safe by keeping firearms out 
of the hands of prohibited purchasers. It would also protect law 
enforcement by reducing the need for ATF agents to retrieve guns from 
individuals who shouldn't have been allowed to purchase them.
   While there is no single measure that will completely eliminate gun 
violence, these bills take crucial steps towards reducing it. They also 
protect the rights of law abiding gun owners. I am proud to support 
these pieces of legislation and encourage my colleagues to do so.

decided to oppose the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler, the nominee for 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.
  While Mr. Wheeler is certainly qualified for this position, I have 
too many concerns with the actions he has taken during his tenure as 
Acting Administrator to be able to support his promotion. I believe 
that Mr. Wheeler, unlike Scott Pruitt, understands the mission of the 
EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards; however, the 
policies he has supported as Acting Administrator are not in the best 
interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the 
threat of climate change to our Nation.
  I met at length with Mr. Wheeler, and we discussed many important 
environmental issues about which I care


deeply, from EPA's enforcement of landmark environmental laws to 
greenhouse gas emissions and mercury pollution. Since last August, the 
EPA has proposed to roll back environmental protections, including 
determining it is no longer ``appropriate and necessary'' to regulate 
mercury emissions from power plants, halting efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, and replacing the Clean 
Power Plan.
  These efforts are of great importance to the State of Maine, which is 
located at the end of our Nation's ``air pollution tailpipe'' and is on 
the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in 
other States. Moreover, there is no doubt that the greenhouse gas 
emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to our 
State's economy and our natural resources, from our working forests, 
fishing, and agricultural industries, to tourism, and recreation.
  Reducing harmful air pollutants is critical for public health, 
particularly for Maine, which has among the highest rates of asthma in 
the country. In Maine, cars, trucks, and other vehicles produce more 
than 50 percent of our State's greenhouse gas emissions. Controls for 
mercury, one of the most persistent and dangerous pollutants, are 
especially important for children and pregnant women. The Agency's 
recent efforts to halt progress in these critical areas takes us in the 
wrong direction.
  In keeping with my past practice, I will vote to allow the full 
Senate to consider Mr. Wheeler's nomination so that every Senator can 
have a clear up or down vote on this important nomination of a member 
of the President's Cabinet.

funeral service will be held on Saturday, March 2, 2019, at 12:00 p.m. 
at Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church in Burkville, Alabama.
  James Austin Jenkins, Jr. was born on December 28, 1937, to the late 
James Austin Jenkins, Sr. and Octavia McCray Jenkins. A product of the 
Lowndes County, Alabama Public School System, he graduated from Lowndes 
County Training School before attending Alabama State University, where 
he received his bachelor's degree in Political Science.
  James built quite an impressive career as a public servant in our 
nation's federal government which was demonstrated through his 
dedicated services to the National Park Service, as a Ranger stationed 
in the Washington Monument and as a Horse Mounted Ranger at Prince 
William Forest Park in Virginia, as well as in Federal Government Law 
Enforcement, and finally as a National Zoological Park Police Officer 
with The Smithsonian Institution.
  George Washington Carver once said, ``No individual has any right to 
come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind distinct 
and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' We are all so 
blessed that Mr. James Austin Jenkins, Jr. passed this way during his 
life's journey. As a proud member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., 
his exuberant personality captured the attention of all those he 
encountered and made him the life of the party wherever he went. He 
will be remembered for his welcoming spirit and love for his 
fraternity, his friends, and above all else, his family. He leaves 
behind a great legacy in public service to and warm cherished memories 
in the lives of those who knew him.
  While he was preceded in death by his parents and brothers, Aaron, 
Frederick, and Elliot; he is survived by his children, Karen, Earl, 
Bianca, Alicia, and Nathan; and a host of family and friends who will 
miss him dearly.
  On a personal note, James and I both understood the importance of 
addressing the important issues facing our nation's Veterans and would 
discuss these issues at the Veterans Brain Trust during the 
Congressional Black Caucus' Annual Legislative Conference, which he 
attended regularly.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, along with my wife, 
Vivian; and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia's Second 
Congressional District in paying tribute to Mr. James Austin Jenkins, 
Jr. for his service to our country. We extend our deepest condolences 
to his family and friends during this difficult time of bereavement and 
pray that they will be comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy 
Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

926,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,2,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed the 
31st new circuit judge since January of 2017. Eric Miller came to the 
Senate for our consideration with a stellar resume and a sterling legal 
reputation. We had every indication he would interpret our Nation's 
laws and Constitution as they are actually written. This is exactly the 
kind of judge the American people deserve to sit on our Nation's courts 
of appeals. That is why the Senate will continue to make judicial 
nominations a top priority.
  This week, however, we need to make more progress on the backlog of 
important executive branch nominees whom Democrats' delaying tactics 
and obstruction have left literally languishing on the Senate calendar.
  The first is Michael Desmond, the President's choice to serve as 
Chief Counsel of the IRS. Mr. Desmond has put his legal expertise to 
work through years of public service, including at the Department of 
Justice Tax Division and at the Department of the Treasury. He has an 
impressive private sector background as well.
  So listen to this: In the last Congress, the Finance Committee 
recommended Mr. Desmond to the full Senate by a vote of 25 to 2. That 
was last August. Yet this noncontroversial nominee never got a floor 
vote and had to be sent back to the White House. Well, Mr. Desmond was 
renominated. Earlier this month, our colleagues on the Finance 
Committee reported him favorably yet again--26 to 2.
  I am sorry my Democratic colleagues required us to file cloture on 
this thoroughly noncontroversial nominee. It is a good example of the 
unreasonable tactics that have, sadly, become their standing operating 
procedure in many cases, but I am glad we voted to advance the 
nomination yesterday, and I urge everyone to join me in voting to 
confirm him soon.


                           The Green New Deal

  Mr. President, on another matter, the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, led by Chairman Barrasso, is meeting today to consider 
legislation that would help reduce, capture, and find productive uses 
for carbon dioxide emissions. It is an important subject and deserves a 
serious approach, but, as we all know, some on the far left have 
recently offered other ideas on this subject. That is right--the much 
heralded Green New Deal. Nothing says forward-thinking and fresh ideas 
quite like borrowing the name of an 80-plus-year-old policy program and 
just adding the color ``green.''
  So what is this thing all about? That turns out to be an interesting 
question. It depends on whom you ask. The Democrats who authored it say 
it is a massive reorganization and government takeover of our Nation's 
economy and our culture. Some have argued it is the only way to stop 
the world from ending in about a decade.
  This was interesting news, even to many of their fellow Democrats. 
Our colleague Senator Durbin reacted this way:

       I have read it, and I have reread it, and I asked [Senator] 
     Ed Markey: ``What in the heck is this?''

  That was the assistant Democratic leader.
  But it looks like, one way or the other, the Democratic Party as a 
whole is eager to get behind this great idea.
  So what is in it? Here are just a few of the hits in the 16-page 
resolution the Senate will soon be voting on.


  Here is one you will like: ``Upgrading all existing buildings in the 
United States and building new buildings.''
  Don't want a Federal bureaucrat to decide how your house should look 
or what size it should be? Don't want to pay to rebuild the entire 
downtown? Don't want to tear down your small business so it can be 
replaced by the government? Too bad. These new social planners know 
best.
  Here is another quote: ``Meeting 100 percent of the power demand in 
the United States''--listen to this--without using any American fossil 
fuels or nuclear power whatsoever.
  That is right. It is the War on Coal on steroids. Say goodbye to all 
of those jobs, and say hello to a new wave of cronyism that would make 
the half a billion dollars in taxpayer losses from Solyndra look like 
pocket change. Everything in your garage will have to go too. A lengthy 
background document that this plan's authors have since tried to scrub 
from the internet helpfully explains that a Green New Deal would mean 
``replac[ing] every combustion engine vehicle.''
  How about this one: ``Guaranteeing a job . . . to all people of the 
United States.''
  That one is buried on page No. 14--a government-guaranteed job for 
everyone. That may sound like a good utopian goal, but their handy 
background document makes the real intention known, promising 
``economic security for all''--listen to this--even for those who are 
``unwilling to work.''
  That is a lot of magic wand-waving, but I have only scratched the 
surface. The background document also called for a plan to ``build out 
high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.'' 
As our colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this might be a tough sell 
in Hawaii or in Puerto Rico or in other places. The Governor of 
California just scaled back a high-speed rail project in California 
because, as he put it, it ``would cost too much and, respectfully, take 
too long.'' Even with heavy Federal subsidies, it is billions over 
budget and behind schedule.
  That document also promised to, magically, ``remove pollution and . . 
. emissions from manufacturing'' just like that. I wonder why nobody 
has thought of that before.
  So it is clear what we have here. It is the far left's Santa Claus 
wish list that is dressed up to look like serious policy.
  Bad ideas are nothing new, and silly proposals come and go, but the 
philosophies and the ideas behind this textbook socialism are not just 
foolish; they are dangerous. Their ascent in the Democratic Party is a 
real threat to American prosperity and to working families.
  Chairman Barrasso reported that one analysis found that this proposal 
could increase the average household's power bills by as much as--
listen to this--$3,800 a year. Another estimate predicted that families 
would have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars just to replace 
common household appliances with Washington-approved models.
  What about the total cost to the government for this socialist 
shopping spree? One recent estimate has that pegged at a cool $93 
trillion over the first 10 years--more than the combined GDP of the 
entire world. Let me say that again. Their plan is predicted to cost 
more than the entire economic output of every country on Earth 
combined.
  Remember what the American people are supposedly getting in return--a 
sprawling socialist state to rule over us, a host of good jobs and key 
industries ripped away, and an end to every energy source that the 
middle class can actually afford. Remember, China has already sailed 
past the United States in terms of carbon emissions. The far left still 
wants us to unilaterally disarm our whole economy--lots of pain for us 
and no meaningful gain in containing global emissions. We will go 
bankrupt, but at least it will be great for China. I bet they are 
cheering in the streets.
  So the way I see it--the way most Republicans see it--is this 
proposal is either a brilliant piece of comedy or a disastrous 
socialist vision that is totally alien to the United States of America.
  What about our Democratic colleagues? Where do they stand?
  Recently, I announced that Senators will get to go on record and vote 
for or against all of this, but curiously enough, this planned vote was 
met with outrage from the very people who were claiming to champion the 
proposal.
  Last night, our colleague from Rhode Island said it was ``truly 
preposterous'' for me to schedule a vote on the Green New Deal. That is 
not exactly a ringing endorsement of a plan the Democrats claim to 
support. He does not seem to be alone in his uneasiness. At one point, 
the Speaker of the House dismissed her party's own plan as the ``green 
dream.'' The senior Senator from California worried publicly the other 
day that there is no way to pay for it. As I noted, the assistant 
Democratic leader summed up a lot of people's thinking when he asked: 
``What in the heck is this?'' I think a great many Americans all across 
the country are asking themselves the very same thing--what the heck is 
this?
  Before much longer, every Member of this body will have a chance to 
go on record, loud and clear. Do our Democratic colleagues really 
support this fantasy novel that is masquerading as public policy? Do 
they really want to completely upend Americans' lives to enact some 
grand socialist vision? Do they really want this to be their Democratic 
Party? Well, before long, the Senate will vote, and these questions 
will be answered.

Green New Deal. I would ask the leader--and we are going to keep asking 
him and every Republican in this Chamber--what they would do about 
climate change, about global warming.
  So, Leader McConnell, do you believe that climate change, global 
warming, is real? Yes or no.
  Second, do you believe that climate change, global warming, is caused 
by humans?
  And, three, do you believe that Congress should take immediate action 
to deal with the problem?
  Until Leader McConnell and his Republican majority answer those 
questions, the games they are playing here will have no meaning. This 
is not a debate. It is a diversion. It is a sham.
  Democrats will be introducing a resolution in a few days--shortly--
that says we believe in these three things, and we will be asking our 
Republicans if they support or oppose that resolution.
  The silence of the Republican majority on climate change is enormous. 
Is it because the oil industry gives so much money to our Republican 
friends? Is it because they are antiscience? What is the reason?
  Not a single bill has been brought to the floor to deal with climate 
change or global warming in the 5 years Leader McConnell has been the 
majority leader. What is your plan, Leader McConnell? What is your 
answer? We know what you don't like. What do you like? Anything?


                              North Korea

  Now, the Trump administration is in the middle of two crucial 
negotiations with foreign capitals, the result of which will have 
ramifications for decades.
  In Vietnam, President Trump will meet with Chairman Kim to continue 
discussions over the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while at 
the same time administration officials continue negotiations with 
Beijing over a major trade pact. In both instances, President Trump 
would have the best chance of having success if he articulated clear 
objectives and maintained a hard line until those objectives were 
achieved.
  For a time, that approach--the right approach--seemed to hold sway at 
the White House, as sanctions and tariffs brought both North Korea and 
China to the negotiating table. Recently, however, President Trump 
seems headed


down the path of capitulation on both North Korea and China, prepared 
to trade away our leverage in exchange for flimsy agreements. The 
President can't seem to stick to a policy, even when it is beginning to 
work. So eager is he for that quick photo op.
  There is an old expression that March comes in like a lion and goes 
out like a lamb. Well, based on all reports, when it comes to North 
Korea and China, spring is coming a little early at the White House. 
President Trump, on both China and North Korea, came in like a lion, 
with tough rhetoric and hard-line policies, but now President Trump is 
poised to go out like a lamb, meekly accepting half-baked agreements 
from both capitals for the sheer sake of it.
  In North Korea the highest priority of U.S. foreign policy has been 
the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula, as well as the cessation of human rights abuses by 
the brutal, despotic, and murderous Kim regime. But just this weekend, 
before leaving for Hanoi, President Trump said: ``I don't want to rush 
anybody; as long as there's no testing, we're happy.'' That is a far 
cry from the complete denuclearization that he called for in the past, 
and it signals a dangerous softening of our position before the talks 
even started.
  The irony of ironies is that for all the talk of ``maximum pressure'' 
and ``fire and fury,'' President Trump's stance on North Korea may wind 
up far weaker than Hillary Clinton's. I know he doesn't like to hear 
that, but the truth is the truth.
  President Trump seems more interested in touting his warm 
relationship with Chairman Kim as an accomplishment in and of itself. 
President Trump's calling a brutal autocrat a friend on Twitter is no 
substitute for actually achieving something for the American people in 
Hanoi.
  I hate to say it, but it would be absolutely incredible and even 
pathetic if President Trump were giving in to North Korea for the sake 
of a photo op to knock Michael Cohen's hearing from the front page, but 
if the past behavior of the President is any guide, something like that 
is, unfortunately, totally conceivable.


                                 China

  Now, Mr. President, the same situation is playing out in China. After 
starting down the right path, press reports indicate that President 
Trump appears to accept something far short of his initial aims. 
President Trump has already started promoting a ``signing summit'' at 
Mar-a-Lago before an agreement has even been inked. Just imagine how 
that undercuts our negotiators--to say already he is going to sign 
something when we are eyeball to eyeball with the Chinese. That is not 
the art of the deal. That is the art of capitulation.
  As the Times reported this morning, ``Mr. Trump has grown impatient 
with the talks, and a consensus is growing in Washington that Mr. Trump 
will ultimately accept a weak deal.'' Shame on him if he does.
  China is robbing and stealing our family jewels: American industrial 
know-how, American information technology, Americans' ability to do 
things.
  When we are good at it, China doesn't let us in and compete, unless 
we give them all of the knowledge of how to do it themselves, and China 
steals our intellectual property. Just 2 weeks ago, there was another 
hacking--and now we are going to capitulate?
  What the Times goes on to say is that ``the Chinese have so far 
declined to make concrete commitments to reform their economy that the 
administration has demanded''--these are the words of the New York 
Times--``including ending China's practice of subsidizing companies, 
engaging in cyber-theft and forcing American companies to hand over 
intellectual property to Chinese partners in order to do business 
there.''
  Even our business community does not want the President to 
capitulate. I met with a bunch of them. They want him to stay strong. 
Everyone wants him to stay strong. Now he is caving.

  This President cannot take a policy and pursue it to its end. His 
attention span is so small, his desire for immediate gratification 
seems to be so large that the American worker loses. If we capitulate 
to China, that American worker will lose for decades. That American 
worker's children will lose.
  So I say to President Trump, it would be a momentous failure if you 
relent now and don't receive meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable 
commitments on structural reforms to China's unfair trade policy. 
Simply buying more soybeans or buying more materials or planes is not 
going to solve the structural problem, and in a few months China will 
continue to unfairly gain on us--not right.
  So, I wonder, where are all the supposed hawks? Where is Secretary 
Pompeo on China and North Korea? Where is Ambassador Bolton? Do they 
feel they can argue internally with the President and he overrules them 
and that is that? What good is it for them to be there? Oh, yes, they 
can say: It would have been even worse if we weren't there. That is no 
way to do policy when either American safety, in regard to North Korea, 
or American economic prosperity in the future, in regard to China, is 
at stake.
  I believe Ambassador Lighthizer has made a sincere effort to do the 
right thing on China, but his efforts are constrained by a President 
who seems intent on weakening his hand every few weeks. Again, where is 
Bolton? Where is Pompeo? Where are they? They have been hawks on these 
two issues their whole lives. Now they get in the administration; they 
just go along, when they were among the loudest critics of President 
Obama and President Clinton? Not right. Not good for America.
  It just so happens that two of President Trump's signature foreign 
policy issues will come to a head at roughly the same time. There are 
historic opportunities here to make America safe by removing nuclear 
weapons from a rogue regime and to end two decades of rapacious Chinese 
trade policy. We can finally put American companies on a level playing 
field with our largest competitor. If the President, having brought the 
Chinese to the table with tough sanctions and tariffs, takes 10 percent 
or 20 percent of what we can get, that would be very bad for this 
country, American workers, and American incomes. As they continue to 
stay flat or decline, one of the main reasons is unfair trade practices 
by China. We have to be strong and tough. We can win this fight if we 
can stay strong.
  The bottom line is this. If over the course of the 1 month President 
Trump capitulates to both Beijing and Pyongyang, the foreign policy of 
his Presidency will be in shambles. It will zig and zag to no real 
accomplishment. More importantly, the national security and economic 
security of the American people will greatly suffer as a consequence.

933,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,9,Mr. THUNE,"  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a document later removed from her 
website, one of the Green New Deal's sponsors had this to say about the 
Green New Deal: ``The question isn't how we will pay for it, but what 
we will do with our new shared prosperity.''
  ``The question isn't how we will pay for it . . .'' That was the 
quote. That is a pretty staggering statement when you consider that the 
Green New Deal plans to upend most of American society as we know it, 
from transportation to healthcare, but I suspect there was a simple 
reason the Green New Deal authors didn't want to talk about how to pay 
for it--because they couldn't figure out how.
  This week, one think tank released a first estimate of what the Green 
New Deal would cost, and here is the answer: between $51 trillion and 
$93 trillion over 10 years--between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. 
Those numbers are so large that they are almost impossible to process.
  Just for perspective, consider the fact that the entire Federal 
budget for 2019 is less than $5 trillion. That is the entire Federal 
budget--defense spending, domestic priorities, Medicare and Medicaid, 
Social Security, everything.
  The Green New Deal could end up costing $9.3 trillion each year--
double the current Federal budget--and the government would still have 
to pay for a lot of other priorities on top of that. That money 
wouldn't cover defense spending, or Social Security, or a number of 
other urgent needs.
  The Green New Deal would assuredly raise Americans' energy bills, but 
that is just a tiny fraction of what Democrats' Green New Deal, which 
goes far


beyond mere energy policy, would cost American families. It is 
difficult to even imagine the staggering tax hikes that would be 
required to pay for this plan.
  This plan would never be paid for just by taxing the well-off. That 
is always the argument we hear. Taxing every household making more than 
$200,000 a year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years would leave the 
Democrats far short of $93 trillion. Taxing every family making more 
than $100,000 a year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years would still 
leave Democrats far short of $93 trillion. In short, actually 
implementing this so-called Green New Deal would involve taking money 
not just from the well-off but from working families in this country--
and not a little bit of money either.
  Ninety-three trillion dollars breaks down to over $600,000 per 
household. That is over 10 times the median household income in my 
State of South Dakota.
  Should the Democratic Green New Deal come to pass, ordinary Americans 
would see incredible tax hikes. Middle-class Americans would see a 
substantial and permanent reduction in their standard of living.
  When we talk about Democrats' socialist fantasies, we tend to quickly 
fasten on the staggering costs of these programs, but it is important 
to also remember what else they would cost Americans.
  Socialism just doesn't come with a staggering pricetag; it also comes 
with less freedom, fewer choices, and less control of your own destiny.
  Socialized medicine like Medicare for All wouldn't mean just big tax 
hikes; it would mean giving up your private insurance plan, even if you 
like your coverage. It would mean being forced onto the government's 
healthcare plan, whether you like it or not. It would mean waiting in 
long lines. It would mean long wait times you can't do anything to 
avoid.
  The Green New Deal would mean higher electricity bills and higher 
taxes, but it would also mean limited transportation choices, including 
no airplane travel, increased government control over your housing 
options, less reliable energy, and the list goes on.
  Democrats' socialist fantasies would cost Americans untold amounts of 
money and permanently damage our economy, but the loss of choice and 
freedom would cost Americans even more. Democrats' green dream would be 
a green nightmare for Americans and American families.

935,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,11,Mr. DURBIN,"  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you are a student of history, the 
speech you just heard is not a new speech. It is a speech that has been 
given repeatedly in the Senate Chamber. It was back in the 1930s, when 
a President named Franklin Delano Roosevelt had an idea, and the idea 
was radical at the time. Here was the radical idea: Shouldn't we allow 
people, during the course of their work-life, to put a little money 
away and to invest for their retirement so that when they reach the age 
of 65, they will have a program called Social Security?
  That was considered a radical socialist idea, taking money from 
everyone to create a positive program to help retirees across America 
when they reach retirement age. It takes away our freedom, they said. 
We ought to be able to make our own choices in life. They resisted it, 
but, fortunately, they failed and in their failure allowed the creation 
of the Social Security Program, which is the single most popular 
government program in America today. Over 95 percent of Americans count 
on Social Security to make sure that when they reach retirement, there 
is something there to take care of them, but that wasn't the end of the 
speech you just heard. It was repeated again in the 1960s because 
another Democratic President by the name of Lyndon Baines Johnson came 
up with a notion that, perhaps, if people are going to live a little 
longer and have Social Security, they should also be able to have 
affordable healthcare. So Lyndon Baines Johnson suggested the creation 
of Medicare.
  What did the critics say about Medicare? Socialism; that you would 
collect money from people all across America just to provide for the 
benefits to those who are retired; that you would take away our freedom 
to make our own savings plans for our future by saying we have to pay 
into Medicare. It is an attack on our freedom, they said. It is a 
socialist idea, they said. Thank goodness they lost in that debate as 
well.
  What happened, of course, was a creation of a Medicare Program, and 
we can see what came about as a result of it, a dramatic increase in 
the number of hospitals in America and doctors in America. We started 
taking healthcare seriously when it came to senior citizens. What is 
the proof in the pudding? Senior citizens started living longer and 
longer lives. They were healthier, they were independent, they were 
strong because of this so-called socialist program of Medicare.
  So if you listened this morning as Republican leaders came to the 
floor and decried socialism again, what is their point now? Their point 
now is, they believe that if we make a national effort toward dealing 
with climate change and global warming, it is socialism. It takes away 
our freedom.
  I would agree with them in this respect. If we do something as a 
nation, a sensible approach that is moderate, constructive, and 
positive, it is going to change the future. It is going to take away 
the opportunity that some of us will have to leave a planet for our 
children that is uninhabitable.
  Does anyone doubt--does anyone doubt--that we are dealing with some 
change in the climate that we face around this world? Does anyone doubt 
that the scientific evidence, year after year after year, about the 
increased temperature of this planet has had a negative impact on the 
world we live in--more extreme weather events than we have ever seen, 
tornadoes in Taylorville, IL, in December?
  Listen, I grew up in Illinois. I was awakened many times in the 
summer to get down in the basement because there was a tornado warning. 
My parents were worried about it. It was part of growing up in the 
Midwest, part of growing up in Illinois. I don't recall ever going down 
to the basement around Christmas. It turns out that tornado season in 
Illinois, and many other places, is now becoming a year-round event and 
flooding and fires and flooding in the city of Miami. All of these 
things are evidence to me that something is going on, and we have the 
scientific explanation. Greenhouse gas emissions are creating a 
different environment, warming our planet, changing our weather 
patterns.
  I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last several years and 
asked one basic question, can anyone name any major political party in 
the world today--any major political party in the world today--that, 
like the Republican Party of the United States, denies climate change?
  I make that open challenge over and over again on the floor and have 
never had a Republican come to me and say: No, there is another party 
somewhere that takes our position on the issue that climate change is a 
fallacy and a fiction. I will tell you, though--maybe I am not supposed 
to repeat this--but one Republican Senator, after I made that challenge 
over and over again, drew me aside in the elevator, looked in both 
directions, and said: I think there is a political party in Australia 
that also denies climate change. That is as good as it gets--one more 
party somewhere halfway around the world.

  When Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, comes to the floor and 
challenges the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, with the basic 
questions, I believe we have the right to ask for an answer.
  To the Republicans, to my friend from South Dakota who just spoke, to 
Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the first question is this: Do you 
believe that there is such a thing as climate change and global 
warming? That is a pretty easy question. The scientists overwhelmingly 
believe it. I do too.
  The second question that Senator Schumer has posed to them is this: 
Do you believe that our human activity has something to do with it? 
Well, the scientific evidence is overwhelming again. Once we got into 
the industrial age and starting spewing all of the smoke and chemicals 
into the air, things started warming up on this planet Earth.
  The third question that Senator Schumer has posed to the Republicans 
is basically fundamental, as well: What


are you going to do about it? The answer is obvious. For the 4 years 
the Republicans have been in control in the Senate, they have done 
nothing--nothing. Now they have a President who has the United States 
as the only country in the world--the only Nation on Earth--that has 
withdrawn from the Paris accord, which tried to create a global 
strategy to deal with climate change.
  The President is enthralled by the notion that climate change is a 
fallacy, a fiction, and so are the Senate Republicans. So any effort to 
address this is socialism. Any idea that we should come together as a 
nation and work toward a planet that our kids can live on is taking 
away our freedom. Well, we know better.
  Under President Obama, we started moving toward more fuel-efficient 
cars and trucks. A gallon of gas is giving us more mileage because of 
government policy. Well, I guess it took away the freedom of gas 
guzzlers, but we can at least say we made a positive step forward, and 
this administration is stepping backward, and they are doing it for the 
fossil fuel industry--for oil and gas and coal interests. They are 
coming to the floor and trying to get us into a fight, once again, over 
socialism when we talk about government policies that would guide us in 
the right direction for the future.


                        Prescription Drug Costs

  Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to give the first of 
what may turn out to be many speeches on a subject that affects every 
single American. The question is the rising cost of prescription drugs 
in this country.
  The first drug that I wanted to address, I wanted to choose carefully 
because I wanted to choose a drug that really is important to the 
largest number of Americans. So I thought to myself, what is the most 
commonly used life-or-death drug in America today? There is some debate 
about it, but I am going to suggest that it is insulin.
  In 1923--almost 100 years ago--researchers were awarded the Nobel 
Prize for the groundbreaking discovery of insulin to treat diabetes--
1923.
  The chief scientist in the discovery was Dr. Frederick Banting. He 
believed that insulin should be accessible to everyone. His team sold 
the patent to the University of Toronto for $1 so that ``no one could 
secure a profitable monopoly'' on the production of insulin. That might 
seem hard to believe today, with the price of insulin having increased 
more than 600 percent over the past two decades.
  Take a look at the chart, which maps the increases in price. Eli 
Lilly's blockbuster insulin drug, Humalog, was introduced in 1996 at a 
cost of $21. By 2019, the cost went up to $329.
  Sanofi's Lantus was $35 when it came to the market in 2001. It now 
costs $270. The insulin drug, NovoLog, cost $40 in 2001. By 2018, it 
went up to $289--for insulin.
  How many Americans are affected by this? There are 30 million 
Americans who live with type 1 or type 2 diabetes--almost 10 percent of 
our population. Approximately 7.5 million of them rely on insulin to 
manage their blood sugar levels. It is a matter of life and death. Yet 
patients are suffering because of these dramatic price spikes.
  A recent study found that one-quarter of patients who rely on insulin 
have been forced to ration their doses due to cost, basically in 
contravention of the advice of their doctors.
  This is a story that many of us have heard here. Last year, we heard 
from the mother of Alec Raeshawn Smith. He went off his mom's health 
insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, he could remain covered until 
he reached the age of 26. He had diabetes. He had coverage for his 
insulin until he reached the age of 26. Then he couldn't afford to buy 
health insurance. So when he went off of that insurance, he was faced 
with the monthly cost of his insulin out of pocket. That monthly cost 
was $1,000.
  He managed a little restaurant, and he couldn't come up with $1,000. 
So he decided that he would ration his insulin and not take as much as 
was required by his doctor, trying to make it last between paychecks. 
Alec died as a result of that decision.
  How is it that in the richest country on Earth, patients are having 
to ration their insulin or start GoFundMe websites just to survive?
  Insulin was a cure found in the 20th century that patients now cannot 
afford in the 21st century. Pharma's war on patients with diabetes must 
come to an end.
  Yesterday, there was a hearing, widely televised, where seven or 
eight of the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies faced the music 
before the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley, Senator Wyden, 
and many others asked questions about the issue I am raising today: 
What is going on? Why are you raising prices so high? There were no 
good answers coming from these executives.
  Today, I am going to start highlighting on the floor of the Senate 
the egregious cases of pharmaceutical greed in the United States.
  Years ago, there was a Senator from Wisconsin named William Proxmire. 
He was an unusual man. He was far different than most Senators today. 
He was the type of fellow who would show up at the University of 
Wisconsin games, passing out cards. That was his style of campaigning. 
He didn't spend a lot of money on television and radio.
  He really was a grassroots politician, and he was a tenacious fellow. 
He started something called the Golden Fleece Award--Proxmire of 
Wisconsin's Golden Fleece Award. Once a month or more, he would come to 
the floor and talk about waste--taxpayer waste--in our Federal 
Government. It developed a national reputation.
  In deference to Senator Proxmire, whom I had a chance to meet when I 
was a college student, I am going to try to follow in his tradition by 
pointing out egregious examples of greed by the pharmaceutical industry 
in the United States on a regular basis with the Pharma Fleece Award.
  My first Pharma Fleece Award is for the pharmaceutical industry's 
extortion of 7.5 million diabetic patients in America who depend on 
insulin. This is a lifesaving product that has been around for almost a 
century.
  How can the most common life-and-death drug be so expensive? First, 
the United States is an outlier. The same companies I am talking about 
sell exactly the same drug in other countries around the world for a 
fraction of the cost.
  The United States represents only 15 percent of all of the global 
insulin market; yet we generate more than half--more than 50 percent--
of Pharma's revenue for this drug.
  How can Lantus cost $372 in the United States? The exact same drug 
made by the same company costs $46 in France and $67 in Canada. Why? 
Why are we paying five, six, and seven times more in the United States 
for exactly the same drug? It is because the governments of France and 
Canada care about the cost, and they say to the company Sanofi, in this 
case, that makes Lantus: If you want to sell Lantus in Canada, we are 
not going to let you hike the prices and raise them to the high 
heavens. We are going to keep the prices reasonable so that the people 
of Canada can afford this lifesaving drug. What do we do in the United 
States? Nothing. We let them charge whatever they wish.
  How can Lantus cost $372 for Americans, while the same, exact drug 
for the French is $46, and just across the border, in Canada, it is 
$67?
  Our problem is that our system doesn't function as a free market. 
There is virtually no competition. Three companies control the insulin 
supply in America: Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk.
  Typically, in a free market, three competitors would lower the 
prices, wouldn't they? But in America, these three charge as much as 
they can and get away with it because they are protected by government-
granted monopolies.
  We should reward innovation, we should promote research, and we 
should ensure that companies do make a profit for their good work, but 
abusive manufacturers should not be protected from competition by our 
government.
  Lantus has been on the market since the year 2000. Sanofi has 
received 49 secondary patents on insulin. What does that mean? They 
have created a fortress around this lucrative drug for a 37-year 
monopoly in offering this drug for sale in America.
  Unfortunately, there is no effective deterrent today against Big 
Pharma's greed and price gouging on these and so many other drugs. That 
is why, earlier this month, I introduced a bill called


the Forcing Limits on Abusive and Tumultuous Prices Act, or FLAT Prices 
Act. This legislation will discourage and deter the pharmaceutical 
industry from raising prices by reducing the government monopoly 
periods when they do.
  You see, companies are awarded monopoly periods from 5 to 12 years by 
the Food and Drug Administration for drug approval beyond the patent 
protection. My FLAT Prices Act would reduce this FDA-granted 
exclusivity period for a drug whose price increases more than 10 
percent a year, bringing generic competitors into the marketplace, 
creating real competition, and trying to lower prices for Americans.
  That brings us to another issue. Today, there remains no generic, no 
biosimilar insulin that can be substituted in a pharmacy. Think about 
it. Almost a century after the discovery of human insulin and even half 
a century after the discovery of synthetic and analog insulin, we still 
don't have a generic insulin for sale in America that is affordable.
  I will acknowledge that these changes in insulin have improved the 
quality of life for patients. They have made them safer, more 
effective, and more convenient, but these changes have delayed the 
development of generic substitutes.
  There are other reasons the FDA has regulated insulin as a drug 
rather than as a biologic, placing insulin under a framework with a 
much higher bar than generics to prove they are substitutes. Thanks to 
the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--the Food and Drug Administration is 
supposed to be shifting its regulatory process for insulin to enable 
copycat versions, known as biosimilars, to be approved quickly. 
Unfortunately, FDA's plan to implement this law will not bring relief 
to patients any time soon.
  I do believe that the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Dr. 
Gottlieb, truly wants to lower costs and spur competition. I wasn't 
convinced when his nomination came up for a vote, but I have had 
subsequent conversations with him, and I think he is genuine. I think 
he wants to see the prices come down.
  However, the Food and Drug Administration's current plan will 
effectively freeze the approval process for lower cost insulin and 
force generic insulin makers who are under review to resubmit their new 
applications each year.
  This creates a 2-year lockup where it is unlikely that any new 
insulin competitors will come to market. America's diabetic patients 
cannot wait.
  That is why Senator Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, and I are 
sending a letter urging the Food and Drug Administration to revise and 
bring flexibility to this process so we can get the lower cost insulin 
on the market approved sooner.
  Two weeks ago, I received a little note from a constituent in Mount 
Vernon, IL. That is downstate, near where my father was born. He wrote 
that both he and his daughter had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 
in 1997. At that time, their Humalog insulin cost $10. Today, he writes 
that the cost is $300 a bottle, and he needs six bottles a month.
  His monthly costs have risen from $600 to $1,800. Here is what he 
said in this letter:

       At some point, drug companies must be held to account for 
     the actions they are taking. These cost increases are costing 
     American citizens to choose between insulin and eating in 
     many cases. I'm tired of listening to all the excuses. . . . 
     what is it going to take for Congress to do its job?

  I agree with my constituent. Congress needs to step up and demand 
real change. The sky-high cost of life-or-death insulin is literally 
killing Americans.
  My work with Senator Cramer to speed FDA approval of lower cost 
insulin and my bill to shorten monopolies for abusive pharma companies 
are a start. This pharma fleecing of insulin patients across America 
must end.

937,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,13,Ms. ERNST,"  Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today on the 
floor by my colleagues to discuss the unprecedented levels of 
obstruction aimed at President Trump's nominees. This issue plagued the 
115th Congress, and it is one I am hopeful we can remedy moving forward 
in this new session.
  The Senate is tasked with the critical role of providing advice and 
consent on many of the President's nominations, including executive 
branch officials and Federal judges. Vetting these officials is a task 
that I take extremely seriously, and I have often welcomed discussion 
regarding these critical appointments with my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, as well as my constituents.
  We can all agree that these positions must be filled by our Nation's 
most qualified candidates, individuals who are committed to public 
service and upholding the values and principles that make our Nation so 
great. We should also be able to agree that these positions should be 
filled using an expedient and timely process.
  As any Iowa small business owner can tell you, if you don't have 
employees, you can't function. Iowans and many others across this 
Nation expect the Federal Government to run on the same commonsense 
principle.
  The recent levels of obstruction for the President's nominees have 
not only kept the executive branch and our Federal courts from staffing 
critical positions but have also prevented the Senate from moving 
forward on other critical legislative priorities and initiatives.
  In the past, the Senate has been able to disagree on certain 
nominations and still move forward in a respectful and expedient manner 
to ensure that the Federal Government operates efficiently. However, 
during President Trump's first Congress, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have utilized a series of procedural tactics to eat 
up time on the Senate floor and to stall the President's nominees.
  To put this in perspective, during President George W. Bush's first 
Congress, the Senate forced a cloture vote on nominations only 4 times. 
That was during President Bush's first Congress. So it was 4 times.
  During President Clinton's first Congress, this increased to a mere 8 
cloture votes--8 cloture votes for Clinton.
  During President Obama's first Congress, the use of this tactic still 
remained minimal, with only 12 cloture votes on nominations. So it was 
Bush, 4; Clinton, 8; and President Obama, 12.
  Compare that to the use of cloture votes during the 115th Congress. 
My Democratic colleagues forced cloture votes 128 times--128 times. 
That is 10 times more often than during President Obama's first 
Congress.
  Despite that President Trump submitted nearly the same number of 
nominees as President Obama, 29 percent more Obama nominees than Trump 
nominees were confirmed during each President's respective first 
Congress. Yet these delays have often not been used to raise objections 
to controversial or unqualified nominees. That is just not the case.
  In fact, nearly half of all recorded cloture votes--48 percent, to be 
exact--received 60 or more votes to end debate. Furthermore, nearly a 
third received 70 or more votes to end debate. These nominees were 
confirmed with widespread bipartisan support.
  Cloture was not invoked in order to extensively debate the merits or 
the qualifications of those candidates. Instead, this procedural tactic 
has been used to run down the clock and prevent the Senate from moving 
forward with other important business.
  Many nominees from my home State of Iowa have been fortunate enough 
to escape some of these political games. I was proud to see the Senate 
reach an agreement in September to move forward and confirm Judge C.J. 
Williams to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa 
by a 79-to-12 vote. I am also glad that multiple U.S. marshals and U.S. 
attorneys have been able to fill critical Federal law enforcement 
positions in Iowa after being confirmed by a voice vote in the Senate.
  However, while many of these positions have been filled back in my 
home State, Iowans are still greatly harmed when the Senate fails to 
efficiently fill executive branch positions whose duties do impact the 
entire Nation.
  Furthermore, many States across our Nation have faced unnecessary 
challenges to filling critical positions after cloture was invoked for 
noncontroversial nominees.
  Take a State like Alabama, for example. Judge Annemarie Carney Axon 
received bipartisan support from both


of her home State Senators for her nomination to serve on the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. However, Democrats 
forced a cloture vote on her nomination before confirming her by a vote 
of 83 to 11.
  Similarly, Judge Terry Doughty was confirmed to be a judge on the 
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana by a 98-to-0 
vote after a forced cloture vote.
  These are not isolated examples. Just last year, multiple district 
judge nominees in Kentucky and Texas received the support of more than 
90 Senators, but only after their nomination was first stalled, again, 
by an unnecessary cloture vote.
  We cannot continue to allow the Senate to be bogged down by 
unprecedented obstruction tactics. The American people expect and 
deserve a fully functioning government with the right personnel in 
place.
  That is why I want to thank Leader McConnell for continuing to make 
nominations such a priority and managing to confirm so many Federal 
judges, despite these tactics. I also thank my colleagues, Senators 
Blunt and Lankford, for introducing a proposal that accelerates the 
nomination process for lower level nominees.
  This commonsense proposal builds on the previous Reid-Schumer rule 
affecting Senate considerations of Obama nominees during the 113th 
Congress--a rule that garnered widespread bipartisan support, including 
the agreement of 35 of my Democratic colleagues who still serve in the 
Senate today.
  I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable proposal that enables 
us to move forward in a timely manner while still encouraging input and 
debate on those candidates. It is time for the Senate to put a halt to 
these delay tactics and get back to fulfilling our commitments to the 
American people. Again, I urge support of the proposal.
  I yield the floor.",E000295,2019-02-27

939,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,15,Mr. CORNYN,"  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, maybe the fastest way to put people to 
sleep is to give a speech on cloture here in the Senate, but I hope 
that is not the case, because, as my colleague from Iowa just pointed 
out, this is an abuse of the Senate rules to do nothing but to obstruct 
and to slow down President Trump's well-qualified nominees for 
important positions.
  This is not about their qualifications. This is not about exercising 
the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. In virtually 
every instance in which the clock has been burned to get to an eventual 
vote, these largely noncontroversial nominees have been confirmed 
overwhelmingly.
  Call it part of the ``Trump derangement'' syndrome or the ``never 
Trump'' effort. It is very clear to me that rather than take these 
nominees one at a time, treat them fairly, assess their qualifications, 
and vote on their nomination, these people are being delayed and denied 
an opportunity to serve, and many of them have just simply given up 
because of the backlog of nominations. It is unfair to them, it is 
unfair to this administration, and it is completely an abuse of the 
Senate rules.
  We know that our Democratic colleagues have unnecessarily blocked 
nominees, put them through the ringer in hearings, and, in one 
particular case--the Kavanaugh nomination--engaged in an all-out smear 
campaign.
  This treatment has grabbed headlines, but the story that doesn't get 
much attention is what I want to talk about now--this practice of 
eating up time on the floor, using every second of the rules to 
essentially eliminate the possibility that we can take up other 
bipartisan legislation or consider these nominees on any sort of 
efficient and effective basis.
  As a result of the work, these nominees are being denied an 
opportunity to serve, the floor is being occupied by nominations that 
are uncontroversial, and we are unable to get to other important work 
that the American people want us to do.
  Now, it is true that the Senate is not known for speed, and, more 
often than not, there is a good reason. When we are appropriating 
taxpayer dollars or debating sanctions on hostile governments or 
negotiating changes to our healthcare system, speed is not always an 
asset.
  But when it comes to confirming nominees--those who already have had 
a hearing, who aren't controversial, who have already received a vote 
in committee--the process should be able to move rather quickly and 
efficiently.
  But, as I said, this is part of a concerted effort to undermine the 
Trump administration, to deny them the appointees necessary for them to 
conduct the Nation's business, and, in many instances, these are 
Ambassadors who should be representing the United States of America in 
foreign countries where it is important we maintain good communication 
with those other countries.
  Over the last 2 years, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
have forced votes on nominees who in previous years would have sailed 
through the Senate.
  Let's look at some of these numbers. You can see how much red there 
is on this chart--cloture votes in the first Congress. President Trump 
had 128 cloture votes, President Obama had 12, President Bush had 4, 
and President Clinton had 8. What that means is that, for example, in 
the Clinton administration, there were 120 nominees who were confirmed 
without the necessity of even going through the procedure of cloture. 
Frequently, these nominees are either passed by voice vote or unanimous 
consent or at some agreed upon time. Even fewer required a cloture vote 
under President George W. Bush. There were 12 under President Obama and 
128 under President Trump. If we were to continue down this same path, 
we would not be able to do anything else except consider nominations by 
this President, and we still wouldn't get to the end of the list.
  Our Democratic colleagues don't want to hold votes on these nominees 
to support or oppose a nomination; they simply want to waste the 
Senate's time and to test the patience of the American people. The 
majority of these nominees, as I said, aren't controversial. Nearly 
half received the support of 60 or more Senators during the cloture 
vote, and more than one-third got 70-plus votes.
  As I said, the delay and obstruction have led to a long list of 
vacancies across every Department and Agency. Critical leadership 
positions have gone unfulfilled while the nominees await confirmation 
votes from the Senate. As I said, many have simply given up, unwilling 
to accept any more disruption in their personal lives in the vain hope 
that perhaps someday, somehow, they will get a vote in the Senate. This 
list includes Ambassadors, Federal judges, Under Secretaries, Assistant 
Secretaries, and inspectors general. The list continues to grow while 
our Democratic colleagues insist on votes that will not change the 
outcome.
  It is one thing to have a nominee whose qualifications are 
controversial or where a debate would enlighten the Members of the 
Senate on how best to cast their vote, but that is not what is 
happening here.
  Despite our repeated pleas for Democrats to cooperate, things aren't 
going to change. That is why the rules change we are contemplating is 
so important. It would expedite the process for many nominees to 
receive a vote on the floor. It won't change the number of votes they 
need to get confirmed--they will still need to get a majority of 
votes--or tilt the scale in their favor in any way; it will simply make 
sure we are not wasting time that is not being used in order to delay 
or defeat nominations.
  Ironically, we have been told by our Senate colleagues on the other 
side that if we were to pass a rule limiting the postcloture time to 2 
hours and we would start it in 2021, at the end of President Trump's 
current term of office, they would vote for it. So this is really an 
unprincipled and nakedly partisan approach, because while they are 
willing to do it for the next President--and that could well be a 
second Trump term, or it could well be another President--they won't do 
it now, which demonstrates the hypocrisy they are exhibiting.
  What would happen is, a nominee would get a hearing in front of the 
appropriate committee. That would be debated, and there would be a vote 
up or down. If the nominee was passed out of the committee and made 
available to come to the floor, the Senate majority leader could still 
file a paper asking for a cloture vote. If that was obtained, then the 
postcloture time would be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours. In the


meantime, there would be an intervening day during which debate would 
occur. Every Senator would still enjoy the right to vote against any 
nominee they don't support, but to just burn time for time's sake is an 
abuse of the Senate rules and needs to stop. It is not just hurting 
these nominees; it is not just hurting the Senate; it is hurting the 
country. These Ambassadors, judges, and appointed officials who serve 
in the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the inspectors 
general who make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent legally and 
efficiently and that people are doing their jobs--none of those 
positions are able to be filled.
  I would point out that this rule change does not apply to all 
nominees. High-level Cabinet positions and Supreme Court Justices would 
still receive the 30 hours of debate time after 51 Senators have voted 
to proceed to that vote.
  It is important to note that this type of rules change isn't new. 
Actually, in 2013, there was a negotiated, bipartisan standing rule 
when Majority Leader Harry Reid and the current Democratic leader, 
Chuck Schumer, introduced a similar change to speed up the process, and 
this simply builds on the foundation they laid down. So if we asked 
them to do now what was done then on a bipartisan basis, their answer 
will be no--for no good reason other than it is President Trump who 
would presumably benefit from this restoration of that same process.
  As I said, the real hypocrisy of their position is indicated by the 
fact that they said they would vote for this rule, but they don't want 
it to take effect now. They want it to take effect in 2021. In short, 
they appear to believe that what we are trying to do is an important 
rules change to make, but they don't want to do it if it benefits a 
President they clearly despise.
  This political theater is being orchestrated by Senate Democrats and 
is impacting our ability to carry out our constitutional duty of advice 
and consent. I believe this is a necessary step to get the Senate back 
on track, and I will support this rules change when it comes to the 
floor for a vote and would encourage all of my colleagues to do the 
same.

943,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,19,Mr. PERDUE,"  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today as one of a number of our 
colleagues to talk about something that really bothers me. We are 
seeing historic obstructionism in the Senate today. It has been going 
on for the last 2 years.
  One of the fundamental responsibilities in the Senate is to provide 
advice and consent on Presidential nominations. When President Trump 
took office, he acted with urgency to fill positions in his 
administration with highly qualified and highly skilled, experienced 
individuals from the real world--not just people from the bubble but 
people from America. Unfortunately, Democrats have slow-walked this 
confirmation process every step of the way. In my view, this is 
historic obstructionism, and it needs to stop.
  This is the first time in U.S. history that the minority party has 
not waived the 30-hour debate rule to this degree. As a result, of the 
1,200 nominees to be confirmed by any new President, only 714 have been 
confirmed to date. At the end of last year, because of this historic 
Democratic obstructionism, we had 386 nominations in line waiting to be 
confirmed. At the end of Obama's first 2 years, only 5 nominees were 
outstanding, compared to the 386 for President Trump at the end of last 
year.
  Let me say that again. At the end of President Obama's first 2 years, 
only five nominees had not been confirmed. That means that out of 
everybody he sent to the Senate, only five at that point had not been 
confirmed. However, at the end of December this past year, President 
Trump still had 386 nominees in the pipeline right here in the U.S. 
Senate, waiting for us to get to them.
  Of the last three Presidents, we have collectively only had 24 
cloture votes required by the minority party--only 24. However, during 
President Trump's first 2 years, Democrats forced 128 cloture votes on 
nominees on the Senate floor. Each one of these cloture votes requires 
30 hours of debate. We can't do anything else on the floor while we are 
doing that. That means the normal business of the Senate cannot be 
transacted because we are waiting, due to the 30-hour debate rule, to 
get to the vote. Basically, under those realities, the Senate is able 
to do only one confirmation per week. Do the math--386 weeks is a long 
time.
  What is going on here has nothing to do with the nominees' 
qualifications, either. Every single one of Donald Trump's nominees who 
received a recorded vote was passed. Not one has failed to pass in this 
body--not one. The vast majority of these nominees are noncontroversial 
and get more than 70 or 80 votes and in some cases more than that.
  This chart shows that of the cloture votes we have had to take, 48 
percent got more than 60 votes, and 37 percent got more than 70. That 
means 70 percent of the nominees got more than 60 votes. These are not 
controversial nominees. That is not the issue.
  My own cousin, who is now Secretary of Agriculture, waited 4 months. 
I know this personally because he bunked in my place for 4 months while 
we were waiting to get his confirmation. When he finally got to the 
floor of the Senate, he got 87 votes.
  It is clear that the Democrats will stop at nothing to obstruct the 
Senate from working on real issues. Every hour we have to spend in the 
30-hour waiting period is time we can't utilize to take up the 
country's business and the priorities Americans want us to be working 
on. If this obstruction continues, President Trump will not have his 
full team in place until the end of his second term.
  These delays are petty, and the American people have had enough. I 
hear about it every time I go home.
  For the last 2 years, several of my colleagues and I have pushed to 
keep the Senate in session during the traditional August State work 
break in order to confirm nominees and make progress on funding the 
Federal Government. In August of 2017, the leader of the majority 
party, Senator McConnell, agreed to keep us here for the month of 
August in order to work on several things we were working on, including 
confirming these nominees. The minority party agreed, after 4 days, to 
basically confirm 77 nominees on that one day. What makes that 
important is that prior to that time in August, in all of that year, we 
had only been able to get 44 nominees confirmed. While staying here 
last August, in 2018, we confirmed 43 nominees and completed 75 percent 
of the government funding bills.
  As I speak today, there are 249 nominees before the U.S. Senate 
waiting to be confirmed. Basically, that would require 249 weeks to do 
if we follow the rule we have been following over the last 2 years. 
These nominees include the Assistant Secretary of Readiness for the 
Department of Defense, who has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 
months. This is in the Department of Defense, the Assistant Secretary 
for Readiness--one of the crisis areas we have in our military. For 8 
months this nominee has been waiting to be confirmed. The Under 
Secretary for Food Safety in the Department of Agriculture--one I hear 
a lot about--has been waiting 9 months in line to be confirmed.
  The people on the other side are saying: The President is just not 
sending up nominees fast enough.
  Well, what happens with these folks who have been sitting here for 9 
months waiting to be confirmed?
  The Assistant Secretary for Economic Development at the Department of 
Commerce has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 months.
  These are not low-level nominees; these are Assistant Secretaries who 
are waiting to be confirmed.
  This has to stop. This President is not even able to form his own 
Cabinet in complete terms because these Assistant Secretaries are not 
in place. We should be working around-the-clock to get these people 
confirmed.
  If this obstructionism continues, we should try to change the 
existing rules for confirming nominees by reducing the 30-hour debate 
rule at minimum. There is a plan in the Senate right now that would 
reduce the 30 hours of debate to 8 hours for most and 2 hours for


some. Reducing the debate time required would speed up the confirmation 
process and allow us to focus on other business in the Senate that 
people want us to address. Every single Democrat in the Senate today 
who was also here in 2013 supported reducing debate time on nominees, 
and they should do so again right now.

  I will close by saying that despite this historic obstructionism, the 
Senate has, indeed, over the last 2 years--because we focused on this 
as a priority, even with this 30-hour debate rule being enacted--we 
confirmed 63 district court judges, 31 circuit court of appeals 
justices, and two Supreme Court Justices. These judges will have an 
impact on the judiciary for years to come.
  By the way, these are not activists with political agendas or 
motives. They are accomplished, experienced jurists, dedicated to 
upholding the Constitution and adhering to the rule of law. It is 
criminal that we waited that long to get these people confirmed.
  I applaud the President for nominating such outstanding individuals 
to these positions. If this historic obstructionism continues in the 
Senate, I believe President Trump will not have his full team in place 
until the end of his second term, if then. This obstruction needs to 
end. The resistance movement threatens the security of our country and 
our ability to deal with the problems facing America today. It is time 
to rise above this partisan gridlock, change the rules, confirm these 
nominees, and finally begin to get results for the American people.
  I yield the floor.",P000612,2019-02-27

945,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,21,Mr. GRASSLEY,"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the 
IRS and tax issues and the tax bill last year, but following on what 
Senator Perdue said, I want to, first of all, compliment him for not 
only this speech but several times he has talked about how the Senate 
has stalled time after time on nominees.
  I want to bring to my colleagues' attention that at one time, there 
was a lot of concern by President Obama that his nominees were not 
being confirmed fast enough. We started hearing that in January 2013. 
All of a sudden, there was a feeling that we ought to have a bipartisan 
solution to this issue to speed along President Obama's nominees. At 
one time, the Democratic leader then was talking about using a nuclear 
option to accomplish a change in rules. Both Republicans and Democrats 
thought that wasn't a very good idea, so Republicans and Democrats got 
together and agreed to reduce postcloture debate time for the rest of 
the 113th Congress, although, before that Congress ended, Senator Reid 
decided to use the nuclear option anyway, and he did that at a later 
time.
  If Republicans and Democrats could get together in the 113th Congress 
to speed up the time and have less postcloture debate time, why can't 
we do it now? The problem, of course, is for the Trump nominees being 
held up in the Senate, the time is far worse than it was under 
President Obama or, for that matter, any other President before that.
  It seems to me, as we are talking about changing the post-debate time 
again--because there is a resolution out of our Rules Committee--I 
think it is about time that we think that what is good for the goose is 
good for the gander, and we ought to reinstate that bipartisan 
agreement. I hope we can get the support of Democrats to do that like 
they had the support of Republicans to do that when we had a Democratic 
President.
  I thank Senator Perdue for what he spoke about on a longer basis than 
I just did, but I want to back him up fully.


                               Tax Reform

  Mr. President, we are in the fifth week of the tax filing season. 
Based on all reports from the IRS, the filing season is running 
smoothly. All systems are operating as expected. Returns are being 
processed and refunds are being sent out without any major 
complications.
  According to IRS Commissioner Rettig, his Agency has even set a 
couple of internal records for the speed at which returns are being 
processed. At one point, the IRS processed 1.9 million returns in an 
hour. That is 536 every single second.
  Of course, you don't hear much about how the filing season is running 
smoothly from our mainstream press. There is a lot of positive news, 
but positive news doesn't seem to make good headlines. Instead, an 
obsession has developed around the size of the tax returns, not the 
exact tax that might actually be paid.
  Let's set aside that the available Treasury data is merely in the 
first few weeks of a very unusual tax season due to the partial 
government shutdown. Never mind that the size of the average tax refund 
can vary greatly from week to week, making year-over-year comparisons 
early in the filing season essentially meaningless. Let's ignore the 
important fact that less than half as many child tax credits and 
earned-income tax credits have been issued as compared to the last year 
based almost entirely on calendar factors, and, most importantly, we 
ought to somehow forget about the fact that the size of one's tax 
refund tells you absolutely nothing about a taxpayers' overall tax 
return.
  I have been amazed by how many of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, who should know better, have sought to equate incomplete 
information about lower average refunds--telling us all that means 
people have not received a decrease in their taxes.
  I want to quote Howard Gleckman, who should be well respected by 
people on the other side of the aisle because he is a senior fellow at 
the liberal Tax Policy Center. He characterized the current obsession 
with tax refunds as ``wrong-headed,'' noting that it is ``not how big a 
refund check filers get this year but how much total tax they paid for 
2018.'' That is common sense. I thank Howard Gleckman for his common 
sense.
  Yet my colleagues--again, on the other side--continue to try and push 
the false narrative that a smaller refund is synonymous with tax 
increase. That doesn't meet the commonsense test.
  Just such a claim by a Senate Democrat running for President was 
observed by the Washington Post's Fact Checker as being ``nonsensical 
and misleading.'' The claim was awarded four Pinocchios. Four 
Pinocchios is a rating the Post reserves for the biggest whoppers.
  Here are the straight facts. Anyone telling the American public that 
a smaller refund is the same as a tax increase is being intentionally 
misleading and doing a disservice to the public. I classify that as a 
big lie. The size of one's tax refund merely reflects what that 
taxpayer overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year. For the vast 
majority of Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 
delivered larger paychecks starting last February. The liberal Tax 
Policy Center confirms that 90 percent of middle-income taxpayers will 
receive a tax cut. That is right. Taxes went down, not up, for the vast 
majority of American families.
  This tax relief stems from the combination of pro-middle-class and 
pro-family provisions, including a nearly doubled standard deduction, 
an increase in the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and overall 
lower tax rates. That is how you give the middle class a tax cut.
  Some may believe that we would have been better off depriving 
taxpayers of their tax cuts until the IRS sent them a refund after the 
end of the year, but this thinking gets things exactly backward. The 
excess tax withheld from paychecks throughout the course of a year 
doesn't belong to the government; it belongs to the taxpayers who 
earned that money. It is the taxpayers who should be able to decide 
whether they want to put their weekly or monthly tax savings in a 
retirement account, pay down a credit card bill, enroll their children 
in some club, sport, music, or dance lessons, or maybe even make an 
extra car payment.
  I encourage all taxpayers interested in how tax reform affects their 
bottom line to compare this year's tax return with last year's tax 
return. That is the commonsense way of figuring out whether your taxes 
went up or down as a result of the tax bill of 2017. When they do that, 
the vast majority will see less of their hard-earned money being sent 
to Washington, DC. Really, that is what ought to matter.
  I encourage those in the media who are actually interested in how tax 
reform has affected taxpayers to take


into account the positive signs we see all around. It is a positive 
sign when we write about how blue-collar employment has surged; 
positive signs about how low-income workers experienced the highest 
wage growth in a decade; positive signs when we report how new business 
startups are climbing and how U.S. manufacturers had their best year 
since 1997; and positive signs as you discuss how the economy grew 
almost 50 percent faster in 2018 than as President Obama's economists 
predicted when they predicted slow growth would be the new normal.
  All of these subjects are far more important than what has thus far, 
in most all respects, been an uneventful filing season. Compare this 
year's tax bottom line with last year's tax bottom line to decide 
whether you got a tax decrease or a tax increase, not the size of your 
refund.

                         Prosposed Rules Change
",,2019-02-27
949,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,25,Mr. LANKFORD,"  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, 2 years ago, I came to this floor of the 
Senate to talk about the rules process and nominations in particular 
because, even 2 years ago, we were experiencing the beginning of what I 
saw to be a trend.
  When elected to office, every President has about 1,200 nominations 
that have to come through the Senate for what is called advice and 
consent. Those individuals go through background checks at the White 
House, they go through interviews through the White House, and they go 
through the extensive review of references. Then they are recommended 
to the respective committees here, where they again go through 
background checks, have conversations, interviews, public hearings, 
questions for the record after the hearings are over, and go through 
any followup from any individual American who wants to give input 
whether that input be from outside groups here or from anywhere else in 
the country. Then they come to the floor of the Senate.
  In the past, those individuals moved through quickly because there 
were 1,200 of them, but the minority has always had the right to have 
one last, little slowdown when they have gotten to the floor. They can 
make what is called a cloture vote request. The minority--any 
individual--could always make a request for a cloture vote to say: I 
know they have gone through all of these extensive checks, that they 
have already passed the committee, that they have gone through all of 
the process, but at the end, I want an additional 30 hours of debate on 
these people. Yet it is not just 30 hours of debate; it is actually 
what is called a full intervening day. After that, there is an 
additional 30 hours of debate for that person.
  That has been done in the past but very rarely in the first 2 years 
of a Presidency because there are so many nominations that have to go 
through the process. If we go back to President Clinton, there were 
eight of those requests. For President Bush, there were four of those. 
For President Obama, there were 12 of those. For President Trump, there 
have been 128 of those.
  Two years ago, I saw the trend of where this was heading. This was a 
new structure for the beginning of a Presidency. I was concerned at 
that time, but I have an even greater concern now. It is the trend of 
where we are headed as a Senate. Is this going to be the new normal? 
This used to be what was normal: Occasional nominees would come through 
if they were very controversial. Yet most of these nominees were not 
really all that controversial. In fact, 48 percent of those nominees 
who had the additional cloture time then got more than 60 votes. In 
fact, 37 percent of them got more than 70 votes. These were not 
controversial individuals coming through; it was just an intentional 
slowing down of the process.
  I have heard folks say: There are so many of these judges who are 
coming through at the district court level that they become very 
controversial.
  Quite frankly, every single judge who comes through has to be 
approved by the two Senators from that State through what is called the 
blue-slip process. This is for all of those district court judges. It 
is a process that has been honored by previous administrations and by 
this administration. This Senate has honored those same blue slips for 
all of the district court judges. If the judges are from a Democratic 
State, both of those Democratic Senators have to approve of them before 
they come. If the judges are from a State that has one Democrat and one 
Republican, it has to be split. If there are two Republicans, they both 
have to agree to it. This is for all of the district court judges. Yet 
they are still being slowed down. They have gone through the background 
checks, and they have been approved by their home State Senators 
regardless of party; yet they are slowed down.
  So whether they are executive nominees or whether they are judicial 
nominees, these 128 individuals being slowed down has created a new 
slowdown in the Senate.
  Two years ago, I made a proposal to go back to something that Harry 
Reid proposed and was passed by this Senate in 2013, which was long 
before I was here. It was a 2-year agreement to just say: Here is how 
we are going to deal with what is called postcloture debate time. If 
there is a controversial nominee, here is how we will handle it.
  I went to my colleagues and said: Let's revive that rule. Instead of 
making it for 2 years, which was the Harry Reid rule, let's just make 
it from here on out. I made that proposal in the last Senate. We took 
that to the Rules Committee. It passed the Rules Committee, but it 
could not pass on this floor.
  I thought it was eminently kind and bipartisan to say that I would go 
back and grab Harry Reid's rule and that if it was good for the 
Democrats when they were in the leadership, it should be good for 
everybody regardless of whether it is the Republicans or the Democrats. 
It did not pass.
  I have once again come back and made a proposal to say let's fix this 
and to not just fix this for now but to fix this from here on out. 
Whether there will be a Democratic President or a Republican President 
in the future, let's have a simple rule: If we get to a nominee who has 
gone through the background checks of the White House, has gone through 
the committee and passed the committee, and has gone through additional 
questions for the record--all of that--if people still want additional 
time, they can still request the intervening day, but then instead of 
30 hours after that full day, it would be just 2 hours of additional 
time.
  Quite frankly, during most of the time that we have had the 30 hours 
of debate, there hasn't really been debate on the floor for 30 hours; 
there has been debate on the floor for, say, 15 or 20 minutes. For the 
rest of the time, the floor has sat empty or we have debated other 
things other than the nominee.
  So we would set aside 2 additional hours. We would do this for 
district court judges, and we would do this for most of the nominees 
for the executive branch, but we would still hold that 30 hours for 
things like nominees for the circuit court, the Supreme Court, and 
those at the Cabinet level. For those types of positions, sure, keep 
the 30 hours, but for the other 1,000-plus nominees who are to be the 
Deputy Secretaries or assistants of whatever it may be, allow them to 
go through the normal process and not slow it down.
  The Chief Counsel for the IRS has not been confirmed. He went through 
the last Congress, but he didn't get there. He passed 25 to 2 out of 
committee. He passed 26 to 2 out of committee this time; yet there is a 
requirement of 30 additional hours of debate on the floor. He will 
probably pass overwhelmingly, but it is just a tactic to slow down this 
floor.
  We have a lot of business to do. Let's make a rule that is fair, and 
let's make it work for everyone. My concern is, long-term for the 
Senate, this will be the new trend, and the next time there is a 
Democratic President, this is what Republicans will do to Democratic 
Presidents, and this will be the new way that we operate.
  This isn't helpful for any President; this isn't helpful for the 
Senate; and this is something we need to fix.
  We have 2 years of muscle memory on this now--of doing it over and 
over


and over. I don't think this gets better because I think the political 
pressure will be there just to keep doing this and slowing things down 
for everybody.
  So we put a rule out there. It has gone through the Rules Committee. 
I have encouraged my Democratic colleagues to join in with this because 
there will be a Democratic President someday in the future, and they 
will not want this coming back at them and will say this is unfair, and 
I will agree. But it will happen, so let's fix it now. Let's resolve 
this in this Senate in this time from here on out--not a short-term 
rule but long-term, permanent--to take us back to this being the norm, 
when we could work better together.
  I love hearing everyone say that we should be more bipartisan as a 
body. I would love to get this body working again. That is this 
proposal. This proposal is not a partisan proposal. It is not trying to 
get leverage on anybody. It is trying to get this body back to working 
again, and I hope in the weeks ahead, when this rule actually comes to 
the floor of the Senate, we can get overwhelming bipartisan support for 
it so that we can get back to working together.

                    Nomination of Andrew R. Wheeler
",,2019-02-27
951,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,27,Ms. STABENOW,"  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a vote that 
we will be having in just a few minutes on the process of moving Andrew 
Wheeler forward as the EPA Administrator.
  This is not a time for talk; it is not time for theoretical debates. 
This is certainly not the time for an EPA Administrator who, during his 
time at the EPA, has ignored climate scientists, rolled back climate 
regulations, and taken action that will lead to more carbon pollution.
  Instead, this is a time for bold, decisive action. We need to act 
today because life on our planet depends on it. The fate of our Nation 
depends on it. Our children's and grandchildren's futures depend on it.
  For those reasons, I cannot support Andrew Wheeler for the critical 
position of EPA Administrator.
  Climate change is real. In fact, it is more than real. It is an 
existential crisis, and it is already having real impact on Michigan 
families and Michigan's economy.
  Some call it global warming. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist 
from Texas Tech, has a better term. She call calls it ``global 
weirding.'' Ask anybody in Michigan. Things have been weird.
  Our lakes are heating up. In fact, Lake Superior is getting about 2 
degrees warmer each decade. That could make the lake a happy home for 
invasive species, like sea lamprey.
  As the waters warm, these parasites grow and kill off more trout and 
salmon and other fish that are key to the Great Lakes' $8 billion 
recreational fishing industry. It is believed that warmer temperatures 
contributed to algal blooms on the lake last summer.
  Other changes we are seeing are life-threatening.
  Thanks to the polar vortex in January, Michigan experienced 
temperatures colder than Antarctica. Scientists believe that climate 
change has caused the jet stream to become wobbly--that is a technical 
term, ``wobbly''--pushing dangerously frigid air south.
  Folks say: Well, how can it be global warming when we see the polar 
vortex? It is about what is happening to destabilize the atmosphere and 
the planet and the changes that are occurring.
  Last weekend, a bomb cyclone hit my State, leaving tens of thousands 
of Michigan residents without power.
  We are having to come up with new terms. I had never heard of a bomb 
cyclone--60-mile-an-hour winds, ripping up homes and farms and 
roadways.
  The intensity of what is happening is incredible. The travel was so 
treacherous in Otsego County that all roads were closed--all of the 
roads were closed. Even drivers on Interstate 75 were getting stuck in 
drifts. That is our major highway.
  We can't link any specific storm to climate change. However, we do 
know that overall climate change is making storms more intense. They 
are longer. They are more intense. They are happening more frequently 
with more intensity.
  Last summer in Houghton County, more than 5\1/2\ inches of rain fell 
in 6 hours. It caused at least $100 million in damage to 
infrastructure, and a 12-year-old-boy died when the basement of his 
home collapsed.
  Our climate is changing, but you don't have to take my word for it. 
Just ask insurance company executives. Their companies paid out a 
record $135 billion--billion dollars--from natural disasters in 2017 
alone. That is almost three times as much as the historic annual 
average, and their projections show it getting worse.
  We need to take action on climate change. While it is not widely 
recognized, I want to speak about something positive that we have done, 
and that was last year's farm bill.
  As you know, the farm bill passed the Senate with a vote of 87 to 
13--the most votes in history. While the bill was historic for a number 
of reasons, one of those is that it includes the most ambitious Federal 
climate-smart agricultural and forestry policies to date, working with 
farmers and ranchers as partners.
  It helps farmers implement climate-smart policies by revamping USDA 
conservation programs to prioritize investments in soil carbon 
sequestration, incentivizing the planting of cover crops, and expanding 
USDA support for farmer participation in carbon markets.
  It also invests in the Rural Energy for America Program, which helps 
farmers and rural small businesses install renewable energy systems and 
creates a joint USDA-Department of Energy education grant program to 
drive carbon capture projects across rural America.
  We must also protect forests and farmland, which serve as vital 
carbon sinks that hold carbon rather than releasing it and making the 
destabilization even worse.
  The farm bill amends the popular Healthy Forests Reserve Program to 
prioritize carbon sequestration practices programs and discourage the 
development of forestland. It authorizes new programs to restore 
national forest landscapes, protect carbon-rich, old-growth trees, and 
prevent uncharacteristic wildfires and their emissions. It establishes 
a landmark soil health demonstration trial to keep carbon in the ground 
and promote healthy and productive farmland.
  I am proud of what we did. It was done with the partnership of 
farmers and ranchers, and I have to say that our farmers understand the 
importance of protecting our land--their land--air, and water, I think, 
as much as, if not more than anyone else. No one's business is more 
impacted by severe and erratic weather than our farmers. They are 
caught right in the middle of it, and I appreciate their working with 
us to be part of the solution.
  I am also working with my colleagues on policies to ensure that the 
United States, not China, is the global leader on advanced 
transportation technologies like electric and hydrogen vehicles.
  Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration are upending 
fuel economy and carbon regulations in a way that hurts the auto 
industry, consumers, and our environment. We need to invest more in 
renewable energy and the research that is making it more affordable all 
the time.
  Electric utilities in Michigan have committed to dramatically 
increase renewable electricity, reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent, 
and stop burning coal.
  Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration have rolled 
back the historic Clean Power Plan.
  I am proud of the fact that Michigan utilities are moving forward 
anyway because they know it is the right thing and they know what is at 
stake. But this administration--Andrew Wheeler--has rolled back the 
historic Clean Power Plan, the Nation's first regulation of greenhouse 
gases from the power sector.
  We need to be laser-focused on climate change and the existential 
threat it represents. Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump 
administration are doing their best to pretend that climate change is 
no big deal. That is even as the Pentagon recently concluded that two-
thirds of critical military installations are threatened--two-thirds of 
critical military installations are threatened--by climate change.


  Climate change is a big deal, and it is time to do something about it 
that is real--not play political games, but to actually do something 
thoughtful and real about it.
  In the wise words of Hank Williams, Jr., ``We need a little less talk 
and a lot more action.'' Andrew Wheeler has repeatedly shown no 
interest in acting. In fact, he wants to take us backward--and is 
taking us backward--on climate change. He has no interest in reducing, 
let alone eliminating, carbon pollution. We need to act, and it is 
clear that Andrew Wheeler is the wrong person to lead the EPA at this 
critical time for our country.
  I urge a ``no'' vote on Andrew Wheeler for EPA Administrator.


                        Nomination of Neomi Rao

  Mr. President, one other brief comment, as some colleagues will be 
coming to the floor in a bit, and I want to join them in speaking about 
the DC Circuit Court nominee Neomi Rao. I stand with them in opposing 
this nomination.
  In the era of #MeToo, when women are sharing their stories about 
assault and abuse, we don't need a judge who has written that women who 
drink are to blame if they are then sexually assaulted.
  We do not need a judge who blocked a critical equal pay measure 
intended to help close the wage gap.
  So I join with colleagues in encouraging, at the appropriate time, a 
``no'' vote on this nomination.

955,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,31,Mrs. MURRAY,"  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the Senator from 
Michigan today, to add to her comments about the replacement for now-
Justice Kavanaugh after he was confirmed to the Supreme Court last 
year, and I want to remind my colleagues about the people who spoke up 
during Justice Kavanaugh's nomination and the critical issues that they 
spoke about.
  Women stood up. They rallied. They marched. They made clear they do 
not want to go back to the days before the Roe v. Wade decision 
affirmed their right to make their own healthcare decisions.
  Incredibly brave survivors, such as Dr. Ford and so many others, said 
they wanted to be heard and believed, not silenced.
  Families across the country said they wanted a Justice who would 
interpret the law fairly and objectively, without partisanship--someone 
whose priority is the Constitution and people across the country, not 
President Trump and his extreme agenda.
  Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it is clear that President Trump 
and Republicans in Congress aren't listening to women or survivors or 
families, because the next nominee for the DC Circuit Court fails on 
each and every count I just listed.
  As we speak, Neomi Rao is enacting the Trump agenda in her role as 
the head of the Agency that reviews and approves the Trump 
administration's changes to regulations impacting so many people in 
communities who stood up to oppose Justice Kavanaugh's nomination.
  Under Ms. Rao's leadership, the Trump administration finalized a rule 
that prevents healthcare providers from even informing patients who 
come to title X-funded health centers about where to go to get safe--
safe--legal abortions and places new, burdensome, medically unnecessary 
requirements on title X-funded health centers, designed specifically to 
prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving these funds, meaning millions 
of patients may lose a source of quality, affordable, basic healthcare 
they trust.
  Ms. Rao has helped put forward rules that would make it harder for 
members of the LGBTQ community and women to get the care they need by 
allowing providers to turn them away simply because of who they are or 
because they want birth control.
  I also want to take a few minutes to address Ms. Rao's deeply 
concerning comments about rape and sexual assault. While in college, 
she wrote that ``a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay 
reasonably sober.''
  Let's be clear. It is never a survivor's fault, ever, that someone 
raped or sexually assaulted them.
  Ms. Rao was given an opportunity to explicitly reject those comments 
and failed to do so. She then sent a letter attempting to walk them 
back, but her actions speak louder than a letter sent during a 
nomination process, and her actions on this issue have been harmful.
  In her role within the Trump administration, Ms. Rao has helped 
Secretary DeVos to roll back protections that help survivors get 
justice when they are sexually assaulted on campuses. In other words, 
at the same time that Ms. Rao claims her views have changed on sexual 
assault and consent, her actions are aligned with those who believe 
what she wrote in college. To the survivors I hear from and those who 
bravely spoke out against Justice Kavanaugh and so many others, Ms. 
Rao's actions are what matters.
  Ms. Rao is also listening to corporate lobbyists instead of 
scientists when it comes to climate and our public health and is 
advancing rules that would allow more discrimination in our Nation's 
housing programs. Unfortunately, it seems that on many issues, where 
President Trump wants to do damage and hurt families, Ms. Rao is right 
behind him with a rubberstamp, just like Justice Kavanaugh and so many 
others President Trump has nominated to the bench.
  We need judges who will do what workers and families expect of a 
judge--to interpret our laws according to the Constitution and what is 
best for our country, not according to politics and what is best for 
President Trump. That is why I am strongly opposing her nomination, and 
I hope all of our colleagues will join us in doing so.

                    Nomination of Michael J. Desmond
",,2019-02-27
957,EXECUTIVE SESSION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1497-6,33,Mr. MENENDEZ,"  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to President 
Trump's nominee for Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service, 
Michael Desmond.
  This nominee comes before us just a week into this year's filing 
season, when our need for an IRS that treats all taxpayers fairly is 
clearer than ever.
  Already, thousands of taxpayers across America are grappling with the 
fallout of the Trump tax bill and its capping of the State and local 
tax, or SALT, deduction. Already, the IRS has reported an average 17 
percent drop in the size of tax refunds this year. Already, the broken 
promises made by President Trump and his Republican allies are being 
laid bare.
  They promised middle-class families thousands of dollars of tax 
relief and a $4,000 raise in their salaries. Instead, they got $1.5 
trillion in more debt and an economy that is even more rigged for big 
corporations and wealthy CEOs.
  As bad as the Trump tax scam is for the whole country, it is worse 
for New Jersey families. That is because Republicans paid for a big 
chunk of their corporate giveaways by gutting the State and local tax 
deduction that New Jersey and other States' middle-class families 
depend on to write off their property taxes. In 2016, 1.8 million 
people--about 40 percent of New Jersey taxpayers--deducted their 
property and State income taxes. More than 80 percent of them earned 
less than $200,000, and the average deduction totaled $18,000--far 
above the arbitrary cap imposed by the Trump tax bill.
  With tax season under way, many homeowners are just now realizing how 
badly their President ripped them off. To add insult to injury, the IRS 
issued haphazard guidance for the Trump tax bill that unfairly targets 
States like New Jersey, trying to simply lessen the burden heaped on 
them by the GOP.
  In the final days of 2017, just days after President Trump signed the 
tax bill, New Jerseyans rushed to prepay their 2018 local property 
taxes and preserve their deductions before the new cap on the SALT 
deductions took effect. But then came Trump's IRS, which issued 
guidance to try to limit their ability to deduct property tax payments 
made in 2017 on their Federal returns--a stunning backdoor attempt to 
retroactively apply the cap on property tax deductions without cleared 
legislative tax to warrant doing so.


  Months later, the IRS again changed the rules on us by attacking New 
Jersey's new charitable deduction tax credit program. The IRS never had 
a problem when 32 other States offered tax credits for charitable 
donations. Only when New Jersey and other similarly situated States 
created a similar program did the IRS decide to change the rules.
  Mr. Desmond would be the Chief Counsel of the IRS, the position 
directly overseeing the IRS's interpretation of these rule changes. 
Throughout his nomination, I was given no indication that Mr. Desmond 
would give fair treatment on these important issues affecting New 
Jersey and other States.
  The full deductibility of State and local taxes has been a bedrock 
principle of our Tax Code since the income tax's creation in 1913, and 
that concept stretches all the way back to Alexander Hamilton's 
writings about the autonomy of States under the U.S. Constitution.
  This commonsense policy allows States to invest in things like public 
safety, education, and infrastructure--the very things that make New 
Jersey a great place to live, work, and raise a family.
  Make no mistake, the property tax deduction isn't just important for 
homeowners. It matters to all New Jersey families. It is why our public 
schools rank among the best in the Nation. It is why Save the Children 
named us the No. 1 State in America to raise a child. I want it to stay 
that way.
  We must protect the investments that make New Jersey a place where 
families thrive. That is why last month I introduced bipartisan 
legislation to fully restore the State and local tax deduction. It is 
called the SALT Act, which stands for ``Stop the Attack on Local 
Taxpayers.'' It is no secret that in New Jersey and in many of the 
Nation's most economically productive States, families face high 
property tax bills and a higher cost of living. Our bill is designed to 
provide some relief. Simply put, the more you pay in property and State 
taxes, the more relief you get from our bill, and we help pay for it by 
repealing some of Trump's most unnecessary tax breaks for the 
superwealthy. It is the exact opposite of what the Trump tax bill says, 
which is, basically that the higher the cost of living is in your 
State, the more you pay in State and local taxes and the more you will 
owe to the Federal Government. That makes no sense.
  Make no mistake, President Trump and his administration and the IRS 
have it out for States like New Jersey. Mr. Desmond would be the 
arbiter of how the IRS would interpret important tax issues affecting 
these States. That is why I oppose his nomination.

965,OBITUARY OF MY FATHER WILLIAM QUIGLEY,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE219-4,0,Mr. QUIGLEY,"  Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to include in the Record the 
obituary of my father William Quigley, published in The Chicago Sun-
Times on February 10, 2019.

    William Quigley, Army Veteran, Father of Congressman, Dies at 92

       Abandoned by his mother, the baby boy--he was about 2--
     ended up at an Indiana orphanage during the Great Depression.
       His luck changed when a WWI veteran and his wife filled out 
     the ``boy or girl'' portion of an adoption application with 
     the words: ``any child we can love.''
       That veteran, William Earl Quigley, made his adopted son 
     his namesake and gave him whatever else he could working as a 
     handyman and farmhand in a rural area outside Indianapolis.
       The origin story stayed with him always--from when he 
     served in the Army during the Korean War era as a newlywed to 
     the time he retired with a pension from AT&T--and formed the 
     bedrock motivation of his life: ``You work hard to give your 
     kids a better chance than you had.''
       On Saturday, after a long battle with Parkinson's disease, 
     Mr. Quigley, 92, died knowing he did just that.
       His daughter Chris is a retired school superintendent. His 
     daughter Linda was a social worker. His son Dan, who passed 
     away two years ago, owned a used-record store. And his son 
     Mike is a U.S. congressman.
       ``He didn't like most politicians, so the irony that his 
     son grew up to be one was not lost upon him,'' said Mike 
     Quigley, who represents Illinois' 5th Congressional District.
       Despite that fact, Mr. Quigley insisted on standing the 
     entire time as his son was sworn in to the House of 
     Representatives in 2009.
       Mr. Quigley regularly wrote letters to politicians calling 
     out ``idiocy and hypocrisy'' and dinner conversation could 
     easily be mistaken for political debate at the Quigley house.
       Whatever adopted dog the family had at the time--there were 
     many and they were all called ``Missy'' because it was easy 
     to remember--was certainly well fed.
       ``He'd spoil those dogs rotten, and sing to them even, 
     because they went through similar things as him. He knew what 
     it was like to be an orphan,'' Mike Quigley said, recalling 
     his dad's habit of mixing table scraps with gravy and 
     offering it to the dogs.
       Mr. Quigley had a unique appreciation for food surpluses.
       ``When you're hungry, you'll eat anything,'' he recalled 
     his father saying. ``We'd be like, `Yeah, right!' And he'd 
     never elaborate, he'd just say, `Trust me.' ''
       Mr. Quigley, who went by Bill, was starting his second year 
     at Purdue University when he was drafted into the Army during 
     the Korean War. He married Joan Louise Deputy in the chapel 
     of a military training facility in Georgia; the couple 
     celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary last June.
       Mr. Quigley spent his post-military career working for AT&T 
     as a supervising engineer. A promotion brought him to the 
     Chicago area in 1967. He settled in Carol Stream. Upon 
     retirement, he moved to Ottawa, Illinois, where he 
     volunteered at a homeless shelter and served on the Ottawa 
     Planning Commission.
       His hobbies included chess and reading. He also built 
     radios, stereos--and his family's first color TV.
       He was also fanatical about the Indianapolis 500; he 
     sported his checkered socks and stopwatches to the race on as 
     many as 60 occasions.
       ``To me he represented a more realistic aspect of the 
     American Dream. He did it all to put a roof over our heads 
     and food on the table,'' Mike Quigley said.
       ``He came from less than nothing and he raised four kids. 
     My accomplishments are a shadow compared to what he was able 
     to do,'' he said.
       In addition to his wife and children, Quigley is also 
     survived by six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

967,GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2238,1,Ms. SHERRILL,"  Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in this Chamber today in support of 
H.R. 8.
  Americans have been waiting for Congress to catch up to them. It 
isn't often that we hear that 70, 80, or 90 percent of Americans agree 
on something, but when it comes to universal background checks, 97 
percent of Americans think it is a good idea.
  In my own district, I have seen that unity. After Parkland, we had 
13,000 people in Morristown, New Jersey, at the student-led March for 
Our Lives demanding gun safety legislation. After the horrific shooting 
at the Tree of Life synagogue, members of the community came together 
to denounce gun violence.
  The 11th District of New Jersey understands that universal background 
checks are a responsible way to address the gun violence epidemic in 
this country. It is a way to keep our communities safe.
  Here in New Jersey, we know that successful, responsible gun 
ownership looks a lot like the legislation we have on the books. We 
have good gun safety laws, but they are constantly undermined by States 
with weak gun safety laws.
  As a Federal prosecutor, I worked on cases where we traced illegal 
guns to neighboring States with weak gun safety laws. That is why it is 
so important that we have stronger Federal gun safety laws. Gun 
violence is a national problem, and it deserves a national response.
  Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a culture of gun safety. My father is a 
hunter, and he taught me how to shoot. I went on to serve in the United 
States Navy, and I was qualified as an expert shot in the M16, the Colt 
45, and the 9-millimeter Beretta.
  I am joined today by a fellow freshman veteran, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania, and we have been trained and know the power of these 
weapons and the damage that they can do. Universal background checks 
are an easy step that we can take to improve gun safety in this 
country.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
Houlahan).",S001207,2019-02-27

for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in support of H.R. 8, and I rise to 
tell the story of one resident from my community, from Pennsylvania's 
Sixth Congressional District, Jamie Loeper, and his parents, Liz and 
Joe, from West Chester, Pennsylvania.

  Jamie had just graduated college and was looking for a permanent 
postcollege job. In the meantime, he was working in a pizza shop in 
West Philadelphia when his life was tragically cut short in January 
2004 when a worker accidentally shot him. This was not done in malice 
but was the result of a coworker accidentally mishandling a gun. Jamie 
passed away when he was 22 years old. Today would have been his 38th 
birthday.
  I rise for the 1,600 Pennsylvanians and nearly 40,000 Americans who 
have lost their lives to gun-related incidents in 2017 alone.
  The Loepers, like mine, are a military family. We understand the 
values of responsible gun ownership but also that we must take 
commonsense steps to reduce gun violence in our communities. We have 
seen for far too long far too many gun-related tragedies over the past 
several years with Congress doing nothing. We must act now.

971,HONORING MAJOR GENERAL CAROL TIMMONS,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2237-4,1,Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER,"  Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my 
colleagues, Senator Tom Carper and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, to 
honor and congratulate Major General Carol Timmons for a lifetime of 
dedicated service to our country.
  After graduating from William Penn High School in 1977, Timmons 
enrolled in college and enlisted in the Delaware National Guard. With a 
childhood dream of becoming an airline pilot, her career in flight 
would begin that very summer on a C-130 airplane in Savannah, Georgia.
  Despite her love of airplanes, Air Force rules prevented women from 
flying combat mission planes like the C-130. Due to these unfair 
regulations, she joined the Army National Guard in 1980 and would learn 
to fly noncombat Army helicopters like the UH-1 Huey.
  Undeterred and committed to her dream, Timmons joined the Air Force 
Reserves, where she flew noncombat support missions. She soon realized 
her dream as Federal laws ended the discriminatory prohibition on women 
flying in combat missions, and during Operation Desert Storm, then-
Captain Timmons would become one of the first women to fly in combat.
  Following that operation, her career would come full circle as she 
rejoined the Delaware National Guard, flying the same C-130s she 
learned to fly on and to operate in the beginning.
  On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier General Timmons would make history 
by becoming the Delaware Air National Guard's first female commander, 
and again on February 1, 2017, when she was promoted to the rank of 
major general and made Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard, 
the Governor's chief military adviser, commanding 1,500 soldiers and 
1,100 airmen.
  During her storied 42-year career, she earned a Bronze Star for her 
service in Afghanistan and has flown over 5,200 hours in the cockpit, 
including 400 combat hours during contingencies spanning from 
Operations Desert Shield to Inherent Resolve. She served on the 
National Guard's Joint Diversity Executive Council and the Air Force 
Reserve Policy Committee. She has received numerous honors, including 
induction into the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame and the Delaware 
Women's Hall of Fame.
  By refusing to compromise on her dream, Timmons broke down barriers, 
blazed trails, and inspired women to let nothing stand in their way in 
service to our Nation.
  I join Senator Carper and Senator Coons in thanking Major General 
Carol Timmons for her over four decades of service to our State and our 
country, and we wish her the very best.

representing a district disproportionately affected by gun violence, I 
know firsthand the toll that it takes on our community. That is why, 
earlier today, I voted on H.R. 8.
  Just a year ago last October, a 27-year-old man was killed in a

act right in front of my house in Little Village in Chicago. As of 
Sunday, our city had witnessed 241 shootings in 2019 so far, including 
two in my neighborhood in the last week.
  In fact, in Chicago, five of six homicides remain unsolved, but 
Chicago has some of the most stringent gun laws in the U.S. What we 
need is Federal legislation that makes it harder to access guns.
  It is our responsibility to stand up for the safety of our 
communities we serve. I am proud to have voted for the passage of the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act moments ago. Tomorrow, we will vote to 
close the Charleston loophole, and I urge my Senate colleagues to 
advance these efforts immediately.

suffering and tearing our communities apart. Pennsylvanians are crying 
out for commonsense legislation to stop the bloodshed, legislation like 
H.R. 8, the bill before us today.
  Now, nobody thinks that universal background checks would eliminate 
gun violence, but the facts suggest that they would reduce it.
  In 2017, the Pennsylvania State Police ran over a million background 
checks on would-be gun purchasers. The vast majority of purchases were 
approved within a few minutes. But 13,000 were stopped, and the 
background checks led to the arrest of 150 wanted fugitives and the 
arrest and conviction of 500 other individuals for illegally attempting 
to obtain a firearm. Those background checks put some bad guys in jail, 
and they probably saved some lives as well.
  Let's help our police enforce the laws that keep guns out of 
dangerous hands. Vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.

974,AN ACTUAL NATIONAL EMERGENCY,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2264-2,0,Ms. WILSON of Florida,"  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to address an 
actual national emergency. There are too many damn guns in America, and 
far too many lives have been lost. Last year alone 40,000 Americans 
were fatally shot, the most in 50 years.
  My county suffers from gun violence on a near-daily basis. In the 
last 5 years, we have lost 370 people to gun violence; 127 of these 
victims were children.
  Recently, a pregnant mother was killed, and her teenage daughter 
injured in a senseless shooting. The family had already lost a relative 
to gun violence.
  Almost as shocking as these statistics, for 25 years Congress failed 
to pass significant gun control legislation until today. I am comforted 
by how swiftly House Democrats began tackling this crisis, and pray 
that the Senate finds the courage to follow our lead.
  American voters sent us an urgent message last November; thoughts and 
prayers and moments of silence are not enough. Let us reassure them 
that passing the Background Checks Act of 2019 is just the first step 
of many more to come; and we won't stop until this national emergency 
is over.

975,EMERGENCY DECLARATION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2241-6,0,Mr. DesJARLAIS,"  Mr. DesJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support President 
Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.
  Sophisticated cartels--some of the most dangerous criminals and 
terrorist organizations in the world--are partnering with foreign 
adversaries, including Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, and China smuggling 
drugs, as well as human beings, into our country.
  Mexican cartels produce or distribute the most heroin, fentanyl, 
cocaine, and methamphetamine here, killing tens of thousands of 
Americans annually.
  My constituents are suffering from the opioid epidemic.
  MS-13 and other violent gangs have infiltrated recent migrant 
caravans; however, the equivalent of a migrant caravan crosses the 
border almost weekly.
  These forces are destabilizing and deadly to people on both sides, 
particularly for the less fortunate among us.
  Under legal authority Congress has granted the executive branch--
which Barack Obama also used to combat cartels and illegal 
immigration--the President, the power to declare a national emergency 
to fund construction of the new border barriers at dangerous weak 
points.
  As a fiscal conservative, constitutionalist, and strong advocate for 
the


military, I believe the need is clear and pressing, the law supports 
immediate action, and ample funding exists to address this crisis.

976,NO MORE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2266-3,0,Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts,"  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, after the Parkland 
shooting, high school students in my district told me a heartbreaking 
truth. They didn't believe that Congress cared about their lives or 
their future. Sadly, I understood why.
  Complacency defined the Republican Congress' position on gun 
violence. They did nothing after moviegoers were slaughtered in Aurora, 
kindergartners were murdered in Newtown, and after one of our own 
colleagues, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot doing her job as a 
U.S. Representative.
  After 46 people were gunned down at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, I 
sat on this very floor in protest. My colleagues and I sat in 
solidarity with a very clear but somber message: No more. No more 
moments of silence. No more inaction while Americans had senseless 
deaths due to gun violence. No more would the entirety of solutions to 
gun violence be tweets with our thoughts and prayers.
  It has been 2 years since the sit-in and, finally, the inaction has 
come to an end. Thanks to the brave survivors, the students, the 
advocates, and the family members, we have been able to pass 
commonsense gun safety.
  Today is a new day, and we will continue this fight.

recognize the achievement of MEP in South Carolina.
  Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina introduced the legislation

  The MEP has served over 26,000 companies. It has earned support in 
Congress for assisting small- to mid-sized manufacturers.
  I am grateful that the South Carolina MEP has generated almost $380 
million in new investment and created 1,361 jobs. It generated almost 
$2.7 billion in statewide economic impact.
  In the Second Congressional District, it helped to create and retain 
989 jobs last year and brought in over $30 million in new investment.
  I commend these employers for creating jobs in South Carolina and 
nationwide.

Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn) for 5 minutes.",,2019-02-27
987,HONORING CIVIL RIGHTS ICON CLARA LUPER,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2239-2,1,Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma,"  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
highlight the visionary and unwavering leadership of civil rights icon 
and notable Oklahoman Ms. Clara Luper.
  Six months ago, I got to witness history as Oklahoma City 
commemorated the 60th anniversary of the sit-ins she organized. I rise 
today because, even as a fifth-generation Oklahoman, I realized how 
little I knew.
  Clara Luper and her students sparked a movement, the sit-ins that led 
into our Nation's civil rights movement. They deserve to be a household 
name.
  Clara Luper made her mark in a time when people of color couldn't 
even walk into the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They were 
relegated to hidden back rooms.
  But she had a vision for equality, a heart for service, and a 
commitment to justice. She, in her words, ``believed in a sun when it 
didn't shine and the rain when it didn't fall.'' She knew that Oklahoma 
and this country could be a place where everyone is treated with 
respect, dignity, and humanity.
  Even as a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer, Oklahoma, 
Ms. Luper instilled those principles in her students. Her steadfast 
commitment to ending racism and systemic discrimination inspired her to 
organize America's first sit-in.
  In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP Youth Council students walked 
up to a lunch counter they knew would refuse them, and they ordered a 
hamburger and a Coke. They were denied, but they did not waver. They 
knew what was on the line because, in Ms. Luper's words, ``within that 
hamburger was the whole essence of democracy.''
  At their own personal peril, they returned each day with more people 
until they broke the barrier. It was never easy. The protesters were 
verbally and physically assaulted, and Ms. Luper received death 
threats.
  Because of Ms. Luper and her students' fearlessness and 
determination, the Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters, 
not just in Oklahoma City but also in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa.
  When the 1958 sit-in happened in Oklahoma City, a group of college 
students in North Carolina were inspired by what had taken place in 
Oklahoma City, and they took note. In 1961, those students launched the 
Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-in at the Woolworth lunch counter, 
which fueled momentum within the civil rights movement.
  It didn't end there. For years, Ms. Luper and others continued their 
fight. The sacrifices continued, too.
  Authorities arrested Ms. Luper 26 times during her fight for freedom. 
Clara Luper empowered young people to imagine a future brighter than 
their present and taught them how to make that future a reality.
  She changed lives and planted seeds of ethical leadership into those 
who were lucky enough to be mentored by her. Each of her former 
students talks about the pivotal role Ms. Luper played in instilling 
confidence, character, and dignity in them.
  Generations reap the benefit of her sacrifice and efforts to 
integrate not only businesses in Oklahoma City but educational spaces.
  Ms. Luper integrated the history department at the University of 
Oklahoma, becoming the first Black graduate of that master's program. 
Her contributions are reflected across our


own State, in a namesake scholarship program at Oklahoma City 
University, a corridor on the northeast side of Oklahoma City, a 
classroom at the University of Central Oklahoma, by the designation of 
the Oklahoma City Public Schools District building as The Clara Luper 
Center, and naming the African American studies department at the 
University of Oklahoma after her.
  As a lifelong Oklahoman and representative of the Fifth Congressional 
District, and as an American, I recognize how we are beneficiaries of 
Clara Luper's efforts to create a more just and equitable place to 
live. I cannot and will not take that history and impact for granted.
  Although we have come so far because of her sacrifices and the 
sacrifices of other heroes during the civil rights era, there is so 
much work to be done. Even with the number of accolades given to her, 
the best way we can honor Ms. Luper is to uphold her legacy through 
commitment to justice and equality in the policies that we propose.
  She knew that democracy is not a spectator sport. It is our duty as a 
Congress and as Americans to make good on the constitutional promise of 
establishing justice and ensuring domestic tranquility, so we must 
continue to work for an inclusive, equitable place for everyone to live 
and feel safe, as well as to build an economy where every American has 
the opportunity to thrive.
  Thank you to the sit-inners, and thank you to Clara Luper for your 
resilience and for giving us the torch to carry.

990,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1538,0,Mr. PERDUE," Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a great 
loss suffered in my home State of Georgia and more specifically in the 
city of Valdosta. For more than 40 years, Parker Greene spent every day 
of his life thinking about how he could make a difference in his 
community by supporting the various missions at Moody Air Force Base, 
which is located just on the outskirts of Valdosta in South Georgia. 
Parker passed away on December 18, 2018, at the age of 86. He leaves 
behind a lasting legacy that will be remembered throughout my home 
State for decades to come.
  Parker moved to Valdosta in 1970 and immediately became involved with 
the Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce. He was named to the 
military affairs committee and quickly developed a fondness for the 
airmen stationed at Moody, as well as the multiple missions housed at 
the base. Through the years, his level of advocacy for Moody continued 
to increase. The local community recognized this and created the Moody 
Support Committee and named Parker as its chairman. As chairman, Parker 
took countless trips every year to Washington, DC, to impress upon 
congressional and Department of Defense leaders the importance of 
maintaining a robust Air Force presence at Moody due to its strategic 
location in the southeastern U.S. and unmatched community support.
  In the 1990s, when the Base Realignment and Closure Commission 
recommended closing Moody and moving its missions to other bases, 
Parker and the Moody Support Committee tirelessly walked the halls of 
Congress and the Pentagon to advocate for the removal of Moody from the 
BRAC list and to increase its mission presence. Parker's efforts proved 
successful. His determination allowed Moody to continue its mission, 
while sparing the Valdosta community from certain economic loss due to 
the closure of the base.
  Following his successful efforts in the 1990s, Parker continued his 
work on Moody's behalf to relocate new missions to the base in order to 
diversify Moody's mission presence and further prove its strategic 
importance. In fact, in 2007, the newly constructed consolidated base 
support center at Moody was named after Parker because of his efforts 
on behalf of the base and its airmen. Former Air Force Chief of Staff 
Michael Moseley was at the renaming and presented Parker with the 
first-ever Chief of Staff Exceptional Service Award.
  Several years later, Parker was awarded the highest honor the Air 
Force can bestow on a civilian: the Air Force Distinguished Public 
Service Award. The award stated that Parker ``distinguished himself by 
service as an Air Force advocate, with both an intimate knowledge of 
Air Force operations and a deep grasp of social and economic issues 
vital to Moody Air Force Base. He has expertly advised the Secretary of 
the Air Force, the Chief of Staff, and senior Air Force leaders on 
these matters while serving as an Air Force civic leader to the 
community surrounding the installation.''
  Of course, Parker could not have accomplished his many feats without 
the loyal and steadfast support from his lovely wife Dr. Lucy Greene. 
Together, they made an unstoppable duo, and Lucy proved to be as 
tireless an advocate for Moody as Parker. I know I speak for the entire 
State when I offer my heartfelt condolences to Lucy and their two 
children, Buck and Sharon.
  While we mourn Parker and the loss to Moody AFB and south Georgia, I 
know that everyone can look at Parker's record of achievement and see 
an unparalleled legacy of selflessness, kindness, and service to 
others. I have no doubt that Moody will continue to be a leading 
example of Air Force excellence because of Parker's impact on the base 
and his advocacy for the region in Atlanta and Washington.

all of those persons in leadership who make it possible for us to have 
these opportunities.
  I am especially proud to be here tonight because we have two 
resolutions that will be presented. These two resolutions have been 
presented before. One is H. Res. 154. This resolution is one that 
honors and praises the NAACP, the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. The second is H. Res. 155. It is a Black 
history resolution.
  It is interesting to note that the NAACP was founded during Black 
History Month. The NAACP was founded February 12, 1909. The NAACP has a 
proud history, and I will say more about it in just a moment.
  Next, I would like to talk for a brief moment about the resolution 
that we have for Black History Month.
  Black History Month didn't start out as Black History Month. The 
Honorable Carter G. Woodson initiated what was called Negro History 
Week. Negro History Week was a time for us to acknowledge the 
accomplishments of African Americans, at that time called Negroes. We 
have metamorphosed through many titles, many names, from Negroes to 
African Americans.
  Black History Month was something that Mr. Woodson found to come into 
being in 1976. This was done by President Joe Ford. As it has been 
designated as Black History Month, we have celebrated it as such across 
the length and breadth of this Nation.
  Carter G. Woodson was a person with great vision. He obviously knew 
that in 1926, when this was initially brought to the attention of the 
public, there was not a good likelihood that you would be able to have 
a Black History Month. But he knew that, if you can start someplace, 
you might finish in a greater place. So he started in 1926 with Black 
History Week, and it has metamorphosed into a month.
  You and I know that every day is a day that we should celebrate all 
history, and Black history is no exception. I am not a person who 
believes that we should have Black History Month forever. I think that 
Black history, properly incorporated and celebrated within American 
history and world history, would be more than enough. But today, we are 
honored to celebrate Black History Month and the NAACP as an 
organization that was founded during Black History Month.
  I would like to say just a few words about this NAACP resolution in 
terms of the first time we brought it to the floor of the Congress of 
the United States of America.
  When we brought it to the floor the very first time, the cosponsor of 
the resolution was Mr. Henry Hyde, and the person who controlled the 
time was Mr. Jim Sensenbrenner. Mr. Sensenbrenner, at that time, was 
the chairperson of the Judiciary Committee. I recall Mr. Sensenbrenner 
standing


over to my right and making his commentary about the NAACP. He spoke 
with a degree of fervor that I thought was needed at the time.
  Mr. Sensenbrenner, while he brought it to the floor and did direct 
the traffic, I would note that it was not an easy resolution to get 
past the House of Representatives. It did pass with consent of the 
House. It was agreed to, if you will.
  Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Hyde had a difficult time getting it 
through the House. I am proud that they did, and I am pleased that none 
of the Members at that time voiced objections to the resolution being 
agreed to. Mr. Sensenbrenner I will always remember as a person who was 
a champion for this resolution, and Mr. Hyde was the cosponsor of the 
NAACP resolution.

  The NAACP is celebrating its 110th anniversary. This is probably the 
Nation's oldest and best known civil rights organization, founded on 
February 12 of 1909, the date of the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's 
birth, the centennial of his birth.
  It is interesting to note that Black History Month was considered 
because of Abraham Lincoln's birth as well, so the two resolutions have 
this in common, Black History Month and the NAACP's being celebrated 
and recognized today.
  It was founded by a diverse group of persons who were outstanding 
citizens. I would also add that it was not founded by a group of 
persons all of whom were African American. I will call off the names 
for you to give you some indication.
  Ida Wells-Barnett, the well-known W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry Moscowitz, 
Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William English 
Walling--all persons who were founders of the NAACP.
  The NAACP, for the early part of its history, had a minority of 
minorities, meaning African Americans were not the dominant force 
within its leadership. They had persons who were carrying the torch of 
freedom such that African Americans could be a part of it. But it is 
interesting to note that, early on, the leadership was predominantly 
Anglo persons.
  The NAACP, as indicated, is the oldest, largest, and most widely 
recognized grassroots-based civil rights organization in the United 
States. The active membership is in all 50 States, including State 
conferences of branches and local branches, as well as branches in 
prisons and chapters on college campuses and high schools throughout 
the Nation.
  The NAACP has its national headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland.
  The NAACP is here to ensure the political, educational, social, and 
economic rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and 
racial discrimination.
  The NAACP is committed to achieving its goals through nonviolence, 
including negotiation, litigation, and protestation.
  The NAACP is well known for its litigation. The Honorable Thurgood 
Marshall, an African American to become Supreme Court Justice, was the 
chief litigator for the NAACP. Under his leadership, with the 
assistance of a good many other people, the NAACP was able to win many 
lawsuits before the Supreme Court. The lawsuit Brown v. Board of 
Education is one of the most notable lawsuits that the NAACP 
championed.
  The NAACP has used political pressure, marches, demonstrations, and 
effective lobbying to secure the voice for those who are considered 
voiceless in the United States of America.
  The NAACP has been fighting segregation in public schools under the 
leadership of Thurgood Marshall, as I indicated earlier, and its 
greatest victories, of course, include, as I indicated, Brown v. Board 
of Education.
  The NAACP, in 2005, launched the Disaster Relief Fund to help 
hurricane survivors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and 
Alabama to rebuild their lives.
  So the organization has metamorphosed into one that does more than 
champion the causes of civil rights as they relate to persons being 
discriminated against. It also champions the causes of those who are 
among the least, the last, and the lost in our society: persons who 
have been locked out, persons who have been left behind, persons who 
but for the NAACP might not have a voice.
  I was very honored to be a part of the NAACP's disaster relief help. 
I am also honored to have been a branch president of the NAACP in 
Houston, Texas.
  The NAACP was instrumental in the enactment of the Matthew Shepard 
and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which generally and 
greatly expanded the legal definition of a hate crime. This was an 
important piece of legislation. I was honored to be here at the time we 
took up the legislation.
  Hate crimes are still crimes that we have to not only acknowledge 
exist, but the law ought to have consequences for persons who commit 
these dastardly deeds.
  Throughout its existence, the NAACP has led the charge to defend the 
constitutional right to vote. That is an important piece of commentary, 
the right to vote. The NAACP is still a part of the effort to assure 
every person the right to vote in this country.
  The NAACP has taken on the challenge of dealing with the photo IDs 
that are required in an insidious way. It has also taken on the 
challenge of making sure that persons are properly registered so that 
they can vote, and also making sure that those who would thwart the 
efforts to register persons to vote are not successful in doing so.
  The NAACP has led the effort to strengthen the Voting Rights Act and 
to protect the principle of one person, one vote. The NAACP led the 
charge in raising awareness about and challenging voter suppression 
laws in Federal courts across the Nation.
  The NAACP board of directors unanimously elected Derrick Johnson as 
its President and CEO, who is doing an outstanding job. I am proud to 
be associated with him and the endeavors.
  I am a proud member of the NAACP. I have been such for a good deal of 
my life. I am honored to have a life membership, to have a golden 
heritage membership, and to have a diamond membership.
  I believe those of us who have benefited from the NAACP ought to be 
members of the organization that has made it possible for us to have 
many of the opportunities that we have. I always acknowledge my 
membership in the organization, and I encourage others to do so who 
happen to be members as well: the NAACP, a proud organization that we 
celebrate during this Black History Month.
  The Black history resolution covers more than the NAACP. It talks 
about Black migrations. It emphasizes the movement of people of African 
descent to new destinations and new social realities. This focuses on, 
primarily, the migration of African Americans in this country. It 
focuses specifically on the 20th century through today.
  It deals with patterns of movement, including the relocation of 
persons of African ancestry from Southern farms to Southern cities; 
from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West; and from the 
Caribbean to the United States. Black people have been in motion in the 
20th century and up to this date, and this resolution acknowledges 
this.


  It also talks about the interactions with law enforcement that often 
result in some ugly circumstances, imprisonment and convict leasing.
  Convict leasing is something that we should give a little bit more 
emphasis to.
  In the State of Texas, we recently discovered a grave site containing 
95 bodies. These 95 bodies were of persons who were victims of the 
State's law that allowed convict leasing.
  Many times persons were charged with minor offenses and while they 
were incarcerated, they could be leased to private parties for the 
purpose of having them work as convicts. And many times--too often, I 
might add--the persons who were leased out, were not treated properly. 
In fact, they were treated poorly.
  Many times they were not given proper food, proper clothing, and 
proper shelter; and as a result, many of them died at an early age. In 
this grave of 95 persons, there are persons who were thought to have 
been teenagers at the time of that death.
  We are not absolutely sure they were all African Americans, but the 
suspicion is that a good many of them were. Some of them were likely to 
have been Anglos as well.
  After finding their bodies in Sugar Land, Texas, on the site of a 
school,


school property, the bodies were exhumed, and they were to be relocated 
to another place. And in so doing, a good many of the citizens, the 
activist community, decided that this was an inappropriate thing to 
do--the bodies being exhumed and reinterred at another location.
  There was a serious meeting before the school board. And the school 
board and the county commissioners, the commissioners court decided 
that it would be appropriate to further study the possibility of 
inhuming these bodies in the place where they were exhumed.
  And my hope is we would follow through on this and give them not only 
a burial site with a proper plaque to memorialize their being in this 
place, but also to do a little bit more and have some sort of structure 
or facility that would allow persons to acquire intelligence about what 
actually happened to these people, how they lived, and how they died, 
and why.
  This country has come a long way, but, of course, we still have much 
more to do. But we want to make sure that we do not overlook the 
history associated with persons who were leased as convicts to private 
persons for the purpose of performing work for them.
  This migration that I spoke of earlier, known as the Great Migration, 
was caused by a lack of economic opportunities because of harsh 
segregation laws in the south and because of the terror that was 
perpetrated against African American communities by the KKK.
  The KKK, obviously, was active in the south; and the KKK, obviously, 
was in the business of terrorizing African American persons. And it is 
interesting to note that while this House has condemned a good many 
persons for their activities, I have not been able to find a record 
showing that the KKK has been condemned for its activities by way of a 
resolution that actually focuses on a person who has been associated 
with that organization.
  The KKK has a horrible history in this country, and it is my hope 
that we in the House of Representatives will take up a resolution 
condemning this entity for what it has done.
  I plan to bring such a resolution to the attention of the House.
  This resolution on black history indicates that prior to 1910; more 
than 90 percent of African Americans lived in the south. And by the 
1970s, 47 percent of all African Americans were living in the north and 
in the west.
  This is why it is called the Great Migration. When you have this much 
of a population moving for opportunities, moving for reasons associated 
with concern for their well-being, that is a significant migration.
  And during World War I, when slowing immigration from Europe created 
a labor shortage in the north, companies began recruiting African 
Americans to fill the assembly lines, to work in steel mills and 
railroads and factories. It was not unusual to hear persons talk about 
``going up north,'' going up north so that they could have 
opportunities in the north that they were unable to acquire in the 
south.
  African Americans who migrated to the north still faced racial 
discrimination in the form of redlining, in the form of racially based 
housing ordinances, in the form of higher rent based on race, and for 
the resurgence of the KKK, and the rising instances of race riots.
  African Americans were not always welcomed with open arms when they 
sought to migrate to these new destinations.
  African Americans created their own cities and neighborhoods, free of 
discrimination, where their culture expanded.
  For example, in Harlem, New York City, that housed over 200,000 
African Americans, there was a culture that was created there in 
Harlem. And we are proud to say that that culture still exists. Harlem 
has been a very important part of African American history.
  Efforts were made to provide educational opportunities for African 
Americans, including the founding of what is now North Carolina Central 
University.
  Greenwood, Oklahoma, is another part of the history that we ought to 
acknowledge. It was a part of Tulsa, and became the home of a thriving 
black business--a section also known as Black Wall Street--until the 
Tulsa riot of 1921, in which a white mob literally burned down 
Greenwood.
  U.S. history has some parts of it that we are not proud of, but we do 
have to acknowledge.
  In Houston, Texas, there is an area known as Freedmen's Town. And 
freed slaves were given the opportunity to purchase land and build 
their homes along the bayou, known as Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas. 
And this was at the end of the Civil War.
  And over six decades, the town thrived with churches and schools and 
stores and theaters and jazz spots--clubs, if you will. This was a 
thriving area dominated by African Americans.

  I would also like to mention another personality;
  Judge Frank M. Johnson, who was said to be one of the most courageous 
judges ever to occupy a Federal bench; he was a part of the effort to 
integrate the south. There are many people who have praised him, 
including Dr. Martin Luther King.
  He is the person who issued the order to require the constabulary to 
allow the marches to proceed across the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they 
marched from Selma to Montgomery.
  He is the person who filed the order--along with the other judges--to 
integrate the bus line, that was called the Montgomery bus boycott. He 
opened the doors to persons of all hues, especially those of African 
ancestry who had been locked out.
  Frank M. Johnson will ever be remembered as a champion of human 
rights. In fact, he will also be remembered as a person who did it 
under adverse circumstances, because he had to have, for many years, 
24-hour security. His mother's home was torched at one time.
  It was not easy to be on the side of African Americans in the early 
part of history.
  Frank M. Johnson took such a stand.
  We would also recognize Senator Edward Brooke, III, who became the 
first African American popularly elected to the United States Senate.
  He was from Massachusetts, and he served there for many years. He was 
the first attorney general of African ancestry in any state.
  In 1962, he cowrote the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited 
discrimination in housing. He was the first Republican to call for 
President Nixon's resignation in light of the Watergate scandal.
  The history of African Americans in the north is one that is rich; 
the history in the south is one that is rich; but they all started, to 
a greater extent, with a migration that proceeded from the south to 
many destinations in the north, as well as in the west.
  So today, we have a resolution that encourages the continued spread 
of knowledge regarding black history, and that it not be limited to one 
month, but that we do this throughout the entire year.
  I am so honored that my colleagues have signed on to this resolution. 
We have had more than 60 colleagues to sign on to one, and I would hope 
that as we continue to present these resolutions, we will have more 
persons who will find favor with them.
  In closing, simply this: The success that we have had as African 
Americans--if we look closely at our history--we will find that it was 
not something that was acquired by our own efforts alone.
  Of course, we have done our part to extricate ourselves from some 
circumstances that were indeed unpleasant and very harmful and hurtful, 
but there were other persons who were there to be of assistance and 
help.
  Many of the stations at the Underground Railroad had persons who were 
not of African ancestry that were there for us as we were traversing 
our way to freedom.
  In many of the battles that were fought in the courtrooms, there were 
persons who were funding the litigation that were not of African 
ancestry.
  The Spingarn brothers are such persons. The NAACP awards its highest 
medal annually in the name of the Spingarns.
  When we have had few people to stand with us, the Jewish community 
has been there. When we have had few people to stand with us, the LGBTQ 
community has been there. When we have had few to stand with us, we 
have had persons of all stripes; Muslims have been there; persons of 
all faiths have been there.


  At the March on Washington, if you take a close look at that march, 
you will see persons of many hues, many stripes, persons from many 
walks of life.
  So we are here today, proud to be here in the well of the Congress of 
the United States of America, but we understand that we didn't get here 
by ourselves, and we are proud to celebrate black history. But we are 
also proud to acknowledge that black history includes the history of a 
lot of persons who were associated with our efforts to acquire our 
freedom, our liberty, and the opportunities that we enjoy today.
  Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for the time, and I proudly 
yield back the time such that you may continue with the business of the 
House.",G000553,2019-02-27

994,METHANE RELIEF ACT,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2264,0,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania,"  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, in 2016, the 
Environmental Protection Agency announced the New Source Performance 
Standards for the oil and natural gas industry to further regulate 
methane emissions. Thankfully, the EPA is revisiting this regulation in 
an effort to provide flexibility and relief moving forward.
  For many small oil and gas producers, these requirements contained in 
the original regulation are simply unworkable and overly burdensome.
  For example, the regulation would even apply to wells that produce 
less than 15 barrels of oil and less than 90,000 cubic feet of natural 
gas per day. Because these wells produce at low volumes, the profit 
margin remains tight for the operators.
  However, under the original rule, these low-volume producers would be 
subject to expensive upgrades, additional reporting requirements and 
administrative costs in order to comply with the regulation.
  Madam Speaker, today I introduced H.R. 1391, the Methane Relief Act 
of 2019, which would exempt these low-volume wells from the rule's 
requirements. Doing so will allow for commonsense regulatory relief and 
certainty for these smaller operators which account for an important 
part of our domestic energy industry.

Jalisa Peterson from Liberty County High School on being a finalist for 
the 2019 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards.
  One of 29,000 students across the country who participated, Ms. 
Peterson was one of only eight high school students acknowledged in the 
State of Georgia for exceptional projects of community service. 
Specifically, she volunteered at a local orphanage, playing games, 
crafting art, reading, and building relationships with children, all 
the way from newborns to 18-year-olds.
  I am very proud of Ms. Peterson's work and glad to have someone like 
her in the First Congressional District of Georgia.

of H.R. 8, which takes a critical first step to ensure that every 
person who purchases a gun undergoes a background check.
  People should have the right to feel safe from gun violence in their 
community, including at home, at work, and at school. Unfortunately, 
that is not the case today in our country. Time and time again, our 
communities have experienced gun violence due to the absence of 
commonsense gun safety measures.
  Only 12 days ago, five people, four of whom were my constituents, 
left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt Company in Aurora, 
Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken by an unspeakably 
horrific act of gun violence.
  It is time to take immediate action to help safeguard our communities 
from gun violence, and today, for the first time in more than two 
decades, the House of Representatives will vote on a major gun safety 
bill, and I will support it.
  H.R. 8 is a strong step toward making our communities safer, and I 
look forward to continuing to work on commonsense legislation that 
balances gun rights with the safety of our communities.

contributions and legacy of Norman W. Deschampe, the longtime chairman 
of the Grand Portage Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa, who recently 
passed away on February 9, 2019.
  Norman Deschampe was born on February 26, 1953, and lived with a 
commitment to improving the lives of the people of the Grand Portage 
Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. For more than 40 years, Norman 
Deschampe served the people of the Grand Portage Band, first as a 
Tribal council member and later as secretary-treasurer and, for 27 
years, as chairman. He also served for 6 years as vice president and 22 
years as president of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.
  Norman Deschampe's legacy includes a longstanding commitment to 
supporting the health, education, and economic development of the Grand 
Portage Band. He promoted environmental stewardship and fostered 
relationships with local, State, and Federal governments to encourage 
conservation on the reservation and beyond. Norman Deschampe encouraged 
the appreciation and preservation of the traditions and customs of the 
Grand Portage Band and is remembered by many for his kindness and 
generosity.
  Norman Deschampe made a lasting contribution to the Grand Portage 
Band and the State of Minnesota, and I am proud to recognize his legacy 
as Minnesota celebrated Norman Deschampe Day on Tuesday, February 26,

work to pass gun violence prevention legislation.
  I would like to share a letter from a fifth grader constituent of 
mine, Alex, from Northfield, Illinois, that perfectly explains why we 
must pass H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.
  Alex writes: ``I don't want to see innocent people dying for no 
reason. I want all children to feel safe at school. I want all adults 
to feel safe at work. I want all people to feel safe in their city. I 
think stronger gun laws will help and also make sure that everyone that 
buys a gun has to have a thorough background check.''
  Well, Alex, you are absolutely right, and we are about to finally 
ensure that everyone who purchases a gun undergoes a comprehensive 
background check. The next step is banning assault weapons.

  On February 27, 1844, the founding fathers of the Dominican 
Republican, great statesmen and lovers of freedom and democracy, raised 
the flag of a new republic in Santo Domingo and proclaimed their 
independence from Haiti, bringing another democratic republic into the 
family of nations.
  In the words of Dominican icon and independence leader Juan Pablo 
Duarte: ``Love of country led us to make sacred commitments with the 
next generation,'' and the commitments that he and his fellow patriots 
made 175 years ago live on in the hearts of every Quisqueyano, whether 
they are still on the island of their birth or whether they have made a 
new home abroad.

Dominican people, just as my compatriots celebrate their independence 
throughout the country.

small businesses and business owners in the Tampa Bay area succeed for

  I think specifically of Ron Pierce, a very good friend of mine who 
started his own consulting firm 10 years ago. Over the past decade, he 
has grown his small business to include four other consultants and now 
provides advice to some of the largest interests in Tampa, including 
the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Port of Tampa Bay.
  On top of managing his own successful business, he is also an 
upstanding member of our community. He regularly volunteers to bring 
food and clothing to families in need. He has worked on youth drowning 
prevention and provided advice to leaders in Tampa Bay on how to 
improve our local economy.
  In recognition of his service, the Chamber recently bestowed upon him 
the Community Leadership Award, the highest honor granted by the 
organization.
  The Greater Brandon Chamber of Commerce is a model organization in my 
district, and it helps small businesses succeed in their work so that 
they can then help others.
  I am proud to be a member of the Brandon Chamber of Commerce. As a 
member of the Small Business Committee, I look forward to working with 
them to create a stronger economy for Tampa Bay.

of Edward P. Chapman, a decorated war veteran and Captain in the 
Springfield Police Department.
  Mr. Chapman was born in Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1942 he enlisted in 
the United States Marines and served in the 5th Marine Division, 27th 
Marine Regiment. He defended our country during World War II and was 
honorably discharged in 1946 and awarded the Purple Heart following his 
service fighting in the Battle of Iwo Jima.
  Upon returning home, Mr. Chapman joined the Springfield Police 
Department, where he served the people of Springfield for thirty years. 
He received his degree in criminal justice from Western New England 
College and later retired in the early 1980's as a Captain in the 
police department. After retiring, Mr. Chapman remained an active 
member of his community, attending mass at St. Patrick's Church in 
Springfield and belonging to American Legion Post No. 452, as well as 
fishing and golfing in his free time.
  Surrounded by family, Mr. Chapman passed away on February 22, 2019,

1008,CLIMATE CHANGE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1546-6,0,Mr. MARKEY,"  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about climate 
change and about our climate crisis.
  Climate change is an existential threat to our country and the 
planet. We know this because the world's leading scientists--the United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--just made that very 
warning last year. The U.N. report told us that we have very limited 
time until we are past the point of no return and the most catastrophic 
impacts of climate change are irreversible. Our own Federal scientists 
across 13 Agencies also just warned in the ``National Climate 
Assessment'' that the impacts of climate change are not in the future 
but are happening in our communities right now. Here is what all 13 
Federal Agencies said: ``Our efforts do not yet approach the scale 
necessary to avoid substantial damages to the economy, environment, and 
human health.''
  These are Earth-shattering reports about the state of our Earth. 
These are the doomsday reports about what will happen if we do not take 
bold action.
  The consequences of climate change will be dire: a tenfold increase 
in ice-free summers in the Arctic, a 99-percent loss of coral reefs, 
and a doubling of species lost around the world. In worst-case 
scenarios in the Northeast, by the end of the century, both the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Logan Airport will be 
underwater. Climate emissions are not slowing down. In 2018, greenhouse 
gas emissions in the United States increased by 2.8 percent. We have a 
denier-in-chief in the White House.
  This week, Republicans in the Senate are poised to confirm a coal 
lobbyist to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is 
unbelievable that we will confirm a coal lobbyist to be the head of our 
environment in our country. Andrew Wheeler's denial of the climate 
crisis should in and of itself be disqualifying. His record as a coal 
lobbyist should be disqualifying.
  We should come together and reject Andrew Wheeler as the next head of 
the Environmental Protection Agency. The impact of climate change on 
ordinary families, on their health, on our Nation, on our security, and 
on our future is too urgent.
  The United Nations tells us that climate change is an existential 
threat to the planet. It is the national security, health, economic, 
and moral issue of our time--of all time. We have a responsibility to 
act. We must be bold. We must be ambitious. That is why I have 
introduced the Green New Deal resolution, because it lays out a 
serious, bold, and aspirational set of goals


that meet the scale of the threat. It is a set of principles and not 
prescriptions. It challenges this country to find solutions to this 
problem.
  The Green New Deal is a climate plan about net-zero emissions. The 
Republican climate plan is in zero existence. They don't have a climate 
plan. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal because they don't like 
a functional government. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal 
because they don't like climate science. Republicans don't like the 
Green New Deal because their allies--the oil companies, the coal 
companies, and the corporate polluters--don't like wind power or solar 
power or all-electric vehicles or the millions of blue-collar jobs they 
can create. We can save all of creation by engaging in massive blue-
collar job creation in this country. Republicans don't like the Green 
New Deal because clean energy is a direct threat to the interests and 
the bottom line of Big Oil and King Coal.
  The Green New Deal isn't just a socialist manifesto. It isn't pie in 
the sky. It isn't a takeover. It isn't any of the misinformation and 
distortions that Republicans and their fossil fuel allies have called 
it. The Green New Deal isn't, as the Republican leader called it this 
morning, ``the far left's Santa Claus wish list dressed up to look like 
serious policy.'' If it were, then Republicans in this Chamber wouldn't 
care enough about it to spend their entire morning remarks on it, and 
the majority leader wouldn't be threatening to bring it to the floor 
without any hearings, without any expert testimony, without any 
amendments, and without any science.
  Let's have the debate. Let's have the hearings. Let's bring in all 
the experts. Let's let the U.N. testify. Let's let our own scientists 
and every one of the Federal Agencies in America testify. Let's bring 
in all of the corporate executives right now on wind, solar, all-
electric vehicles, and storage batteries in our society. Bring them in. 
Let's hear the stories. Instead, what we have is just an attempt to 
short-circuit the debate.
  They may not believe climate change is an existential threat to human 
kind, but they are smart enough to know that the bold goals of the 
Green New Deal are an existential threat to the Koch brothers and all 
of their other corporate polluter and fossil fuel allies.
  Let me just read some of what is in the Green New Deal that 
Republicans are opposed to: securing for all people of the United 
States for generations to come clean air and water, climate and 
community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable 
environment.
  Are Republicans opposed to access to nature? That is in the 
resolution. Are Republicans opposed to clean air and water? That is in 
the resolution too. Do you know what is not in the resolution? Ending 
airline travel. Do you know what is not in the resolution? No more 
cows.
  Do you know what is not in the resolution? A prohibition on nuclear 
energy or carbon capture and sequestration. The Green New Deal 
resolution is bold, and it is aspirational in its principles, but it is 
not prescriptive in its policies.
  Let's look at some of what is actually in this resolution: to create 
millions of good, high-wage jobs--I guess Republicans don't believe in 
that; to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States 
to sustainably meet the challenge of the 21st century--I guess 
Republicans don't believe in that; guaranteeing universal access to 
clean water, supporting family farming, cleaning up existing hazardous 
waste and abandoned sites, ensuring economic development and 
sustainability on those sites--I guess Republicans don't believe in 
those either. Those are all part of the Green New Deal and climate 
solutions.
  We already know that Big Oil and King Coal and other fossil fuel 
companies don't want to compete with clean energy because that is a 
direct threat to their business plan.
  Clean energy makes the air we breathe cleaner, it saves consumers 
money, it makes us safer, and it creates jobs.
  In his remarks, the Republican leader called the Green New Deal 
``foolish and dangerous.'' With all due respect to the leader and my 
Republican colleagues, the only foolish and dangerous thing about the 
Green New Deal is to ignore the $400 billion in damage to our country 
over the last 2 years from supercharged storms and wildfires all over 
California and all over the West.
  To ignore the tens of trillions of dollars in damages we will see 
from climate change in the United States by 2100 is something that 
ultimately, from my perspective, is foolish and dangerous. An ounce of 
prevention is better than a pound of cure. Ignoring what is happening, 
ignoring the warnings from all of the top scientists in the world and 
in the United States and continuing on the same pathway--that is 
foolish, that is dangerous, and that is going to cost us tens of 
trillions of dollars in damages that would have been otherwise avoided 
if we unleashed a technology revolution in our country that would 
create millions of new jobs.
  It is also dangerous to send our men and women in the military 
overseas to protect tankers of oil coming from the Middle East to the 
United States. We are still bringing in oil from Saudi Arabia. We are 
still bringing in oil from other countries in the Middle East. What if 
we could dramatically increase the fuel economy in the vehicles we 
drive? What if we could accelerate the pace to use all-electric 
vehicles? Wouldn't it be great if we could say that the day arrived 
when we never have to see another tanker of oil from the Middle East 
coming into our country? Would that not make us safer? Would that not 
give us better control of our own foreign policy and where we send 
young men and women in uniform? I think it would.
  I think it would be foolish and dangerous not to take that pathway. 
The superstorms, the wildfires, the rising seas, and the other extreme 
weather events--the impacts of climate change if we do not act boldly 
to stop it--that isn't just dangerous; that is an existential threat. 
That is what the world's scientists have called it.
  The Green New Deal is dangerous for the status quo of doing nothing 
on climate change. It is dangerous for the Koch brothers and those who 
are used to killing off every climate debate before it gets a chance to 
start. It is dangerous for those who want us to limp into a frightening 
future with no plan and no protections in place. It is dangerous for 
those who benefit from the continued devaluation of our workers, the 
historic oppression of vulnerable communities, and from the continued 
destruction of the environment. Those are the ones who would think the 
Green New Deal is dangerous.
  We want to support working families and support a safe climate future 
where all communities are protected. We welcome a debate on proposals 
for how to get there, but the science is clear as to where we need to 
end up.
  The Republicans may think that the Green New Deal is just a 
resolution, but it is a revolution. It is a revolution. Young people 
want a green energy revolution in our country. They know we can do 
this. They know that all of these new technologies can be invented; all 
of these new technologies can be deployed.
  It is not just a resolution; it is a revolution. All across this 
country, when the Republicans have refused to bring their climate plan 
out there because theirs is a party of science denial--the President is 
the ``Denier in Chief'' on climate science--then we are going to allow 
this problem to worsen and worsen and worsen.
  Do you know who should know best? Donald Trump, because within 30 
years, according to the science, Mar-a-Lago is going to become Mar-a-
Lagoon. It is right on the coast. It has already begun to happen. It is 
just going to continue.
  The President might be able to protect his property, but we are going 
to lose tens of trillions of dollars for the properties of other 
Americans because he decided that he was going to deny the warning that 
the scientists have presented to us.
  When I was a boy, lying on the rug, looking at President Kennedy on 
the television, he challenged our country to send a mission to the Moon 
and to return that mission safely to the United States within 10 years.
  When he gave that speech at Rice University, he made very clear in 
the speech that we would have to invent new metal alloys that did not 
exist. We would have to invent new transmission systems that did not 
exist, that we would have to return that mission safely from the Moon 
through heat half the


intensity of the Sun. We would have to complete it within 10 years, and 
we would have to do it not because it was easy but because it was hard. 
We had to be bold.
  Because the challenge from the Soviet Union was so great, the United 
States did not have an option. Failure was not an option, and we 
completed that mission.
  Well, the same thing is true here for a Green New Deal. Failure is 
not an option. The consequences will be catastrophic for our planet and 
for the United States of America, and the solution is to unleash this 
green energy job-creation engine. We now have 350,000 solar and wind 
workers in the United States. It is up from almost nothing in 2008. It 
has already happened over 10 years.
  We had only 1,000 megawatts of solar in our country in 2008. We now 
have 62,000 megawatts of solar.
  We had only 25,000 megawatts of wind. We now have 98,000 megawatts of 
wind.
  We had only 2,000 all-electric vehicles in our country in 2008. We 
now have a million, and between Tesla and all of the other companies, 
they are going to sell 500,000 just this year in our country. They have 
invented new metals. They have invented new battery systems. They have 
invented new propulsion systems in order to solve those problems, but 
we still have a long way to go.
  It is imperative that we put the tax breaks for wind and solar, for 
all electric vehicles, for batteries on the books and make them 
permanent because this problem is going to be solved only if we can 
convince the smartest young people in our country that all of the 
incentives, all of the policies are there and that their country has 
their back and wants them to solve the problem in the same way that our 
whole country had the back of NASA in the 1960s. If we do that, we will 
be successful. There is no question about it in my mind.
  I am a technological optimist, and I hate the pessimism of the other 
side. I hate this ``can't do'' mentality that they have, especially 
given what has happened in the last 10 years in electric vehicles and 
wind, solar, and storage technology breakthroughs. It is just really 
sad to hear this.
  I think, ultimately, something is rising up across this country. 
Young people, especially, know it is time for the revolution. They know 
it is time to close the door on this era where all we do is 
indiscriminately use the atmosphere as a sewer for all of this carbon 
and all of these greenhouse gases.
  I am very confident that one way or another this body will start to 
act or it is going to become one of the top two or three election 
issues in 2020 because this generation knows that the planet is running 
a fever. There are no emergency rooms on planets, and it is going to 
take action in this body in order to put the policies in place, in 
order to preserve this planet and hand it on better than we found it.
  The challenge is great. The Green New Deal sets the framework for 
laying out how serious the problem is and how bold the action has to be 
to deal with that serious problem for our planet.
  If we do it right, I think future generations will look back on ours 
in the same way we now look back on President Kennedy and that 
generation, and they will know that they discharged their historic 
responsibility to our country and to the planet.
  With that, I yield the floor.

1013,CLIMATE CHANGE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1546-6,5,Ms. HIRONO,"  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, in many ways, Andrew Wheeler is a perfect 
example of a Cabinet appointment in the Trump era--conflicted, 
unethical, and hostile to the mission of the Agency he was nominated to 
lead.
  He shouldn't have been confirmed to this position as Deputy 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, and he 
certainly shouldn't be confirmed to lead the Agency on a permanent 
basis.
  Prior to his service at EPA, Mr. Wheeler spent 8 years lobbying for 
many of the special interests that he is targeted or charged with 
regulating. For example, in his work for Murray Energy, whose 
president, Robert Murray, was among the largest donors to Donald 
Trump's 2016 campaign, Mr. Wheeler worked to kill a rule that would 
have prevented coal companies from dumping mining waste into American 
streams and waterways.
  As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Mr. Wheeler also fought tooth and 
nail against President Obama's Clean Power Plan, a forward-looking 
initiative that would have substantially reduced carbon emissions from 
power generation.
  Mr. Wheeler's client, Robert Murray, was present front and center as 
former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed an Executive order to 
begin the process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan. I don't think 
that was a coincidence.
  After Mr. Wheeler's confirmation as the EPA's Deputy Administrator, 
he assured Bloomberg News in June 2018: ``If I lobbied on something, I 
don't think it's appropriate for me to participate [in policymaking].''
  Of course, he was lobbying on a lot of things for years. In fact, Mr. 
Wheeler participated in meetings with three former clients with 
interests before the EPA. Holding these meetings with former clients is 
a clear conflict of interest and ethical lapse. Andrew Wheeler fits 
right in with Donald Trump's version of ``draining the swamp,'' which 
is more like ``come on in, the water's fine.''
  We have already had one EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, resign in 
disgrace over ethical lapses and potentially illegal behavior in 
office. We don't need another.
  Mr. Wheeler's work at the EPA is also consistent with the hostility 
of Trump Cabinet officials to the core mission of the Department or the 
Agency that they are appointed to lead.
  The EPA is the primary Agency charged with safeguarding the 
environment and protecting public health from dangerous and toxic 
chemicals. At its core, the EPA is tasked with making sure we have safe 
air to breathe and clean water to drink.
  Yet, during his time as Deputy Administrator, Mr. Wheeler has 
championed a deregulatory agenda that fundamentally undermines the 
EPA's core mission. Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has 
proposed undermining the legal authority of the mercury and air toxics 
standard to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air emissions 
from coal and oil burning powerplants.
  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, mercury exposure can 
damage the nervous, digestive, and immune systems and is a serious 
threat to child development. The EPA's current efforts to reverse these 
emission standards, in place since 2012, come after utilities across 
the country had already invested resources in reducing mercury 
emissions by 90 percent.
  Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the Trump administration has also 
proposed a dramatic weakening of fuel economy and greenhouse gas 
emissions standards for cars. Their proposed rule would increase air 
pollution from vehicles and would result in Hawaii families ending up 
paying thousands more dollars for gasoline to fill less efficient 
cars. Through his opposition to the Clean Power Plan and his efforts to 
repeal it at the EPA, Mr. Wheeler serves as a primary architect of the 
Trump administration's assault on climate science and their refusal to 
act decisively against climate change. This assault can also be seen in 
a new proposed rule from the EPA that would exclude rigorous, peer-
reviewed scientific studies under the guise of promoting scientific 
transparency.

  At first glance, the rule sounds like something everyone should 
support, but like so many initiatives proposed by this administration, 
the rule's true intent is much more sinister.
  Insisting that policymaking rely only on studies that make all of 
their data public would exclude studies that rely on confidential 
medical information that by law cannot be made public. Limiting the 
factual basis on which the EPA can make decisions in this manner would 
have a catastrophic impact on public health.
  If this rule had been in effect in 1993, the ``Six Cities'' study by 
the Harvard


School of Public Health would never have transformed the way we 
regulate air pollution in this country. The study showed that Americans 
living in cities with more air pollution have shorter lifespans than 
Americans living in cities with less air pollution.
  Using confidential medical information, the study conclusively 
demonstrated that fine particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 
microns is exceptionally deadly to human beings. These findings, which 
have been backed up in subsequent studies, provide the basis for cost-
benefit analyses done by EPA for future rules regulating air pollution. 
Undermining this kind of evidence-based policymaking would give 
industry the green light to pollute with fewer consequences.
  This proposed rule is consistent with an administration-wide effort 
to promote ignorance in the face of the real threat climate change 
poses to national security, public health, and public safety.
  Climate change is an issue where ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is 
dangerous. The President's own top security officials agree. Director 
of National Intelligence Dan Coats, for example, issued a new worldwide 
threat that concluded that ``climate hazards'' like extreme weather, 
wildfires, droughts, and acidifying oceans are, ``threatening 
infrastructure, health and water and food security.''
  In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis told the Senate Armed 
Services Committee that ``climate change is impacting stability in 
areas of the world where our troops are operating.'' He went on to say 
that ``climate change is a challenge that requires a broader whole-of-
government government response.''
  Instead of accepting the conclusions of his top national security 
officials, Donald Trump is following the recommendation of William 
Happer, a notorious climate denier and now a Senior Director on the 
NSC, to establish a new Presidential Committee on Climate Security.
  Dr. Happer is particularly notorious for his assertion that ``the 
demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the 
poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the 
world, and so are the Jews.
  Anyone who makes this kind of outrageous analogy should not be 
entrusted to lead anything on climate security, in my view.
  No one should doubt that the President and Dr. Happer have a 
preordained outcome in mind. They want to legitimize ignorance and 
denial of climate change and abandon tens of millions of Americans to 
the disastrous impacts of climate change in the coming decades.
  I repeat, with climate change, ignorance is not bliss. It is 
dangerous. It is dangerous for a State like Hawaii that would be the 
hardest hit by the impact of climate change. With extreme weather, 
ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and rising seas, climate change 
poses an existential threat to our State. It is one of the reasons 
Hawaii has implemented some of the most ambitious and aggressive 
policies to combat climate change in the country.
  Hawaii was the first State to separately ratify the Paris climate 
agreement and has set an ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral and 
generating 100 percent of our power from renewable sources by 2045. 
Hawaii's ambitious effort to confront climate change and the success we 
have already seen in moving toward our goals demonstrate that we can 
embrace similarly ambitious policies at the national level.
  It is one of the reasons I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Green 
New Deal--an aspirational effort to transform our economy to combat 
climate change.
  In the weeks since the plan was introduced, we have endured all kinds 
of mocking outrage from people who would rather stick their heads in 
the sand as science and fact deniers. They paint the Green New Deal as 
something scary and dangerous for the country. What is really scary and 
dangerous are people like them who deny that climate change is real and 
refuse to do anything about it in their steadfast support and alliance 
with the fossil fuel industry. History will not be kind to them.
  Rejecting the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency, we can take one step forward in 
the fight against dangerous ignorance.
  I yield the floor.",H001042,2019-02-27

1015,CLIMATE CHANGE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1546-6,7,Mr. MERKLEY,"  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau once said: ``What use 
is a home if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?''
  We might just expand that question to say what use is anything if we 
destroy our planet because it is the only one we have. There is no 
planet B, no rescuing by going to some horrific other planet nearby. We 
have the gem, we have the treasure, and we have the responsibility to 
make sure we don't destroy it.
  Here we are. Within a single human lifetime, we have increased the 
percent of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by a dramatic amount--about 
30 percent in my lifetime and more if you are older--and that chemistry 
change is really unseen in geological history on this planet, such a 
rapid change with rapid, deep growth.
  That is why we are coming to the floor to keep talking about this 
issue, reach across the aisle, reach across the country, and find 
partners to say this isn't a blue or red issue. This isn't a city or 
rural issue. It affects us all, and we need to all work together to 
respond. As we do so, we need America to lead the world in responding.
  Senator Carper's resolution says a couple simple things. It says we 
recognize that we have a very warming climate on Earth. It says we 
recognize that human activity burning fossil fuel has consequences, and 
it calls on us to act. There we are. It is time to confront this 
enormous threat to our beautiful blue-green home in the middle of the 
cosmos.
  There are some who say: That is so scary, so intimidating, so 
threatening. I just can't open my eyes or ears to hear that 
information. I have to pretend it is not real.
  We are here in the Senate. We are here where we don't have the 
privilege of covering our eyes, our ears, pretending it is not 
happening. We have the responsibility to face this when others shy away 
and act.
  There are others who say: You know, we just can't be sure exactly 
what is happening so let's wait another 10 or 20 years because we can't 
measure it as precisely as we want. It is like saying: Oh, cancer is 
ravaging my body, but I am not going to take any medicine because I am 
not sure if it has affected 15 percent or 16 percent of my cells. Well, 
you know you have cancer, and you know you need to act.
  So there we are. Let us not let our heads be buried in the tar sands. 
Climate chaos is real. It is ravaging our planet. It is because of 
human activity, and we do have the responsibility to respond.
  The year 2018 was one of the four hottest years on record. Nine out 
of the ten of the hottest years on record occurred since the year 2000. 
If we are looking at this chart, we don't see the Earth becoming any 
cooler. We see the Earth becoming a lot warmer. Four of the hottest 
years on record, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015--that was the last 4 years 
having been the 4 hottest years on record. The odds of that happening 
by accident is essentially none.
  We have some very serious scientific heft weighing in. In October, 
the United Nations climate panel said we must act dramatically within 
this next decade. A month later, on Black Friday, we had the release of 
the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment''--the Trump administration's 
``Fourth National Climate Assessment''--and it concluded that ``Earth's 
climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of 
modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.''
  There was a report from the Global Carbon Project that which found 
that global carbon emissions are going up. They went up 0.7 percent in 
2018, hitting a record breaking 37.1 metric tons around the world. That 
is human activity putting out carbon dioxide that acts as a blanket on 
the planet. This isn't some new thought.
  We go back to 1959. We had an eminent scientist who became better 
known for his work in the nuclear world, but he was asked to address 
the 100th anniversary of the petroleum industry. At that speech in 
1959, he said: The energy you have unleashed and harnessed can do 
dramatic things to


change the world, but you have a couple of challenges. One challenge is 
that there isn't an infinite amount of petroleum in the ground. Another 
challenge is it creates carbon dioxide. It doesn't look like a 
pollutant because you can't see it and you can't smell it, but in fact, 
it traps heat. I think he framed it more scientifically, that it traps 
infrared energy.
  He said that is going to be a problem, and, of course, we are seeing 
that problem all the time now. You don't need these scientific reports 
out of a global panel or a fourth assessment from the administration to 
tell us what is going on because we see the facts on the ground.
  In my home State of Oregon, you can't move around the State without 
seeing the impact. In Eastern Oregon, you have the warmer winter. It is 
not killing the pine beetles. So the pine beetles are killing the 
trees. More pine beetles and less trees is not a good thing.
  If you are over on the coast, the oyster men will tell you they had a 
big crisis in 2008 and 2009 because all of the baby oysters were dying, 
not because of a bacteria but because the acidity in the Pacific Ocean 
has gone up. How is that related? Because carbon dioxide is absorbed by 
the ocean and becomes carbonic acid. We burn so much carbon dioxide 
that we changed the acidity of the ocean. Can you imagine that is 
possible? It seems impossible, but it speaks to how much carbon dioxide 
we released within a few decades of human civilization on this planet.
  You can keep going on with this story around Oregon. Our kelp beds 
are disappearing. They provide protection for all kinds of fish 
species. The kelp are dying because the blue sea urchins are eating 
them. The blue sea urchins are expanding rapidly because the starfish 
are dying because the ocean got too warm for them. It is one story 
after another. There is less irrigation water, less snowpack, warmer 
streams, and harsher conditions for trout and salmon all within the 
State of Oregon, and there are similar stories throughout our Nation.
  Perhaps the most destructive factor, though, has been the increased 
number of forest fires. There are bigger fires, hotter fires, and a 
longer fire season. They are not just ravaging our forests but 
producing smoke that has a huge impact on our towns. We take a lot of 
pride in our wine in Oregon, and a lot of our grapes had smoke taint 
and weren't usable this last year.
  We have towns where furniture salesmen said they couldn't sell the 
furniture because it had the lingering smell of smoke.
  It had an impact on the entertainment world. The Shakespeare Festival 
had to shut down and partially move inside to smaller venues, which is 
having a huge impact on their finances and a huge impact on the tourism 
attraction.
  This stuff is real. It is why we should all be here, Democrats and 
Republicans, talking about the challenge and saying: What higher 
calling is there in our life than to come together to discuss this 
honestly and to work together to find solutions?
  This isn't something where we can just say that the next generation 
can deal with it because the effects are cumulative. They build up. 
They become worse. It is a lot worse now than it was 10 years ago, and 
10 years from now, it will be more so.
  There is no easy, fast way to strip the carbon dioxide back out of 
the air. We can work at it, but it is not easy. We can plant more 
trees, yes, but, meanwhile, those hotter fires are killing more trees. 
Those pine beetles are killing more trees. In other words, it is 
urgent. The time to act is now.
  In 1988 George H. W. Bush ran for President as an environmentalist. 
He announced he was going to take on global warming. His opponent, the 
Democrat, ran on the coal industry. That is not the same partisan 
alliance as you might hear today. George H. W. Bush said: ``Our land, 
water and soil support a remarkable range of human activities, but they 
can only take so much and we must remember to treat them not as a given 
but as a gift.''
  Those words should echo in this Chamber. We have other words in this 
Chamber that seem to not address all of the facts that are right in 
front of us. One individual said: ``The satellite says it ain't 
happening.'' Well, one could probably pick out some one piece of data 
from one satellite somewhere and say it doesn't show the story, but you 
collect all the data together and it is happening.
  Here is a chart of how the globe is warming over time. It shows the 
difference in average temperatures. Here we are with just one tiny 
cache where there is a significant drop in temperature. There is a 
little bit of white and light blue showing that it stayed about the 
same, and there is a whole lot of red saying things are getting a lot 
worse. That is the collected data. Maybe there is some satellite that 
took a picture of one little spot here, but to cherry-pick data like 
that is dishonest.
  We can't afford to pretend that things are OK when we are facing such 
a dramatic challenge to our blue-green home in the universe. NOAA, or 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, works at this, and 
they record all kinds of data from all around the world.
  Here is another chart that shows the Earth's climate record. This one 
shows the zigs and zags over time. We are going back to 1880, but if we 
look from 1880 to 1980, we see a significant rise in the temperature of 
the planet. If we go from 1980 until now, it is this absolutely 
frightening horror show of increasing temperature. That is what is 
happening when we talk about snowpacks. We talk about glaciers, we talk 
about coral, we talk about pine beetles, and we talk about 100 of these 
things where there is that feedback. All of those affect humans. Those 
aren't just some abstract things, like if a tree falls in the woods but 
nobody hears it, did it really happen? Did we really hear it? Does it 
matter? No.
  These reverberate back on our quality of life in this planet, 
including security concerns. The civil war in Syria that produced 
millions of refugees trying to get to Europe started with an extended 
drought because of the stresses of a warming planet.
  Our military weighs in and says that climate chaos accentuates all 
the security concerns we have. It creates instability around the world. 
If one doesn't want to listen to the scientists, how about if we listen 
to our own military?
  That is what the discussion of Senator Carper's resolution is all 
about. That is what the Green New Deal is all about. The Green New Deal 
says a few simple things. It says we have a big problem. Check. Yes, we 
do. It says we need to take it on boldly and aggressively. Check. Yes, 
we do. It says when we take it on boldly, we can create millions of 
jobs, and that will be a good thing for our economy. Check. Yes, it is.
  Creating those jobs is good. It says when we do that, we shouldn't 
leave our frontline communities behind. We should make sure those 
communities--rural communities and inner-city communities that have 
been left behind previously in different economic expansions--can't be 
left behind now. Check. That is absolutely right.
  Let's make this economic surge benefit everyone in every community, 
with special attention to communities that have been struggling.
  My colleague is here from Virginia. I am so glad he is. I am talking 
a lot about what is happening on the west coast of America. Perhaps he 
will fill us in a little bit on the perspective from the east coast. 
This is not one isolated spot on our planet. This is a concern to all 
of us. We need bipartisan work on this. Some suggest we put a fee on 
carbon. Let's have that conversation. Some suggest we provide more 
subsidies to renewable energy. Let's have that conversation. Some say 
we should do a green workforce--green corps training. Let's talk about 
that. Let's talk about every strategy we can bring to bear and come to 
a collective plan because there is no space in the urgency of this 
issue for us to retreat into blue and red corners. There is no time. It 
is unacceptable.
  I feel it is such a privilege to come to this floor and be part of 
this conversation, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do likewise. 
There are few issues that threaten us on this scale, but this one does. 
Let's work together to save our country and save our planet.
  Thank you, Mr. President.",M001176,2019-02-27

1023,RECOGNIZING NACDS RxIMPACT DAY,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE223-2,0,Mr. SHIMKUS,"  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the NACDS RxIMPACT 
Day on Capitol Hill that is coming up next week. This is a special day 
where we will have the chance to recognize the pharmacy industry's many 
contributions to the American healthcare system.
  Organized by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), 
this event will take place on March 5-6, 2019. More than 400 
individuals from all 50 states representing the pharmacy community--
including practicing pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty and students, 
state pharmacy association representatives, and pharmacy company 
leaders--will be on Capitol Hill. They will visit every House and 
Senate office to share their views with us about the importance of 
supporting their access agenda--legislative priorities that will ensure 
that our constituents will continue to have access to more than 40,000 
community and neighborhood pharmacies across the country and be better 
able to utilize pharmacists to improve healthcare quality while 
reducing the cost of care.
  Local pharmacists are important community leaders, who are trusted by 
their patients to efficiently provide high quality, convenient 
healthcare services. And as demand for healthcare services continues to 
grow, pharmacists are stepping in to fill gaps in healthcare delivery 
by partnering with physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers 
to address the unmet need. Moreover, pharmacists continually innovate 
to provide unique services that improve overall patient health and 
wellness.
  Further, in many communities the local pharmacist is a patient's most 
direct healthcare access point. This is particularly true in rural 
areas. In fact, 91 percent of Americans live within five miles of a 
community pharmacy. These pharmacies bring value to their communities 
by providing care to those who need it most--older Americans and those 
who manage chronic conditions, particularly in rural and underserved 
areas. In addition, pharmacists frequently work with patients to 
navigate specific pharmacy benefits and the use of generic 
substitutions to identify strategies to save money. Pharmacists also 
ensure medications are administered appropriately, and offer other 
preventative services that help improve patients overall wellbeing and 
quality of life.
  The pharmacy advocates attending NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill 
will be educating members on their access agenda. As we debate the 
future of healthcare, the pharmacy community wishes to work with us to 
help develop solutions that put pharmacy's value to work for patients 
and payers. Specifically, NACDS's advocates will be seeking our support 
for policies that will help address prescription drug affordability and 
transparency through much-needed reform to DIR fees, a complicated fee 
structure imposed on pharmacies to participate in the Medicare Part D 
program. They will also highlight proposals designed to address the 
opioid epidemic.
  I believe Congress should work with the 2019 NACDS RxIMPACT Day on 
Capitol Hill advocates to advance policies that support pharmacists in 
their effort to improve care, increase access, and lower costs.

1025,CELEBRATING WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE215-2,0,Mr. VISCLOSKY,"  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration 
that I rise today in observance of Women's History Month and its 2019 
theme--Visionary Women: Champions of Peace and Nonviolence. Each year, 
the National Women's History Project selects a unifying theme to 
recognize and promote Women's History Month. This year's theme features 
the stories of women from diverse backgrounds and fields who have 
advocated for peace and human rights throughout the world.
   In the United States, women of every race, class, and ethnic 
background have played a critical role in advocating for unity and 
peace. For generations, women have contributed to resolving conflicts 
and have worked to promote nonviolence in the workplace, schools, 
homes, communities, and government. Women have insisted upon and 
continue to fight for respect, justice, and peace for all of humanity.
   Strong pioneers such as Graciela Sanchez, Dr. E. Faye Williams, and 
Dorothy Cotton built their lives upon fighting for equal rights and 
eliminating racism and sexism. Leaders including Deborah Tucker 
advocated for improvements of laws and policies worldwide. Ms. Tucker 
helped write and pass the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Sister 
Alice Zachmann was also a trailblazer who dedicated her life to ending 
war and violence, giving much of her time and efforts to organizations 
that supported the end of the Vietnam War. In 1982, Sister Zachmann 
founded the Guatemala Human Rights Commission USA and served as its 
director for twenty years. For their leadership and outstanding 
dedication to women's rights, unity, and peace, they are well deserving 
of our respect and admiration. I commend these fine women and the many 
others who have fought alongside them for securing rights for all women 
of every creed, class, and ethnic background. These fearless and strong 
women serve as remarkable role models who reflect the 2019 theme, 
Visionary Women: Champions of Peace and Nonviolence.
   Madam Speaker, I am honored to join in celebrating Women's History 
Month and to recognize that after decades of dedication, perseverance, 
contributions, and advances, great American women from all cultures and 
classes are being celebrated. To illustrate the numerous brave women of 
our nation's history, we remember and recount the tales of our 
ancestors' talents, sacrifices, and commitments that serve as an 
inspiration to today's generation. I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in celebrating these brave women who 
have improved American society and whose stories are woven into the 
fabric of our nation.

1026,BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1535,0,Mr. ENZI,"  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for February 2019. The report compares current-law 
levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to 
in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is 
necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether 
budgetary points of order lie against pending legislation. The 
Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget 
Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the 
Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
  This is my second scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can 
be found in the Congressional Record for January 10, 2019. The 
information included in this report is current through February 25, 
2019.
  Since my last filing, two bills with significant budgetary effects 
cleared Congress, the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019, P.L. 116-3, and 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, P.L. 116-6.
  Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables 1-3.
  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee 
exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays 
under the most recently adopted budget resolution and the fiscal year 
2019 enforceable levels filing. This information is used for enforcing 
committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Over the 
current 10-year enforceable window, authorizing committees have 
increased outlays by a combined $3.4 billion. For this reporting 
period, as in my last report, 8 of the 16 authorizing committees are 
not in compliance with their allocations. Two of these committees, 
Finance and Judiciary, further exacerbated their violations during this 
work period with the passage of Medicaid Extenders and the authorizing 
division, Division H, of the final 2019 appropriations bill, 
respectively. For the Finance Committee, P.L. 116-3 was estimated to 
increase budget authority over each enforceable period for its 
allocation, with the largest violation, $120 million, occurring in 
2019. For the Judiciary Committee, Division H of P.L. 116-6, which 
included various immigration extenders, was estimated to increase 
budget authority and outlays by $30 million over the next 10 years.
  Table 2 provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This 
information is used to determine points of order related to the 
spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations 
for fiscal year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the 
Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for fiscal 
year 2019. Those limits for regular discretionary spending are $647 
billion for accounts in the defense category and $597 billion for 
accounts in the nondefense category of spending.
  The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order 
limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations 
bills, CHIMPs. Table 3, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for 
fiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $15 
billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for fiscal year 2019. The fiscal year 
2019 CHIMPs were contained in the Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education and Related Agencies division of P.L. 115-245 and the 
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies division of P.L. 116-
6. This information is used for determining the point of order under 
section 4102, overall limit, of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.
  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican 
staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget 
totals approved by Congress.
  For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are $2.8 
billion above and $3.3 billion below enforceable levels for budget 
authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $426 million below 
the level assumed in the budget resolution. Further, Social Security 
revenues are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social 
Security outlays are $4 million above assumed levels for the budget 
year.
  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate 
pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases 
in fiscal year 2019 of $1,930 million--$427 million revenue loss, 
$1,503 million outlay increase--over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period 
of $3,337 million--$894 million revenue loss, $2,443 million outlay 
increase--and over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $425 million--
$634 million revenue loss, $209 million outlay decrease. During this 
work period, one bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, 
included a statutory exemption for the budgetary effects of its 
Division H from the Senate's PAYGO scorecard. The Senate's PAYGO rule 
is enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.
  This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget 
enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May 
7, 2018. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were 
raised.
  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.
  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in 
the Record.",E000285,2019-02-27

falsely declared that there was a national emergency occurring at our 
southern border.
  The real emergency that he should be focusing on is the devastating 
gun violence epidemic that has torn communities apart across our 
country, including my own, where we are still mourning the loss of 12 
precious lives at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, 
California.
  This week, the House will vote on the first major gun safety 
legislation in decades. While there is no single answer that will stop 
all gun violence, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 are commonsense, bipartisan 
steps to strengthen our background check system to keep deadly firearms 
out of the hands of those we agree should not have them.

1030,IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE PAUL K. LEARY,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE222-5,0,Mr. KEATING,"  Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the life 
of the Honorable Paul K. Leary, who led a life committed to justice as 
well as improving the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
  Born in Boston in 1939, Judge Leary spent his entire life in 
Massachusetts. After graduating from Suffolk Law School, Judge Leary 
worked in the Boston Municipal Court system. He then moved on to become 
First Assistant District Attorney for the Suffolk County District 
Attorney's office. Judge Leary ended his career as First Justice of the 
Boston Municipal court, where he started his career at the age of 
sixteen.
  Alongside his jobs in the Suffolk County District Attorney's office 
and the Boston municipal court, Judge Leary taught at Suffolk 
University Law School and lectured at New England School of Law. He 
served for a period as the President of the National Board of Trial 
Advocacy and was awarded their Lifetime Achievement Award in July of 
last year.
  Judge Leary was a dedicated family man and a staple in his community. 
He coached his son's youth hockey team in Milton all the way to the 
state championship in 1980. Judge Leary spent his summers in Pocasset, 
where he could be found with family and friends, playing golf or 
racquetball, or having dinner at one of his favorite local restaurants.
  Judge Leary has led a life dedicated to justice and upholding the 
laws of Massachusetts.


He not only held positions in the judicial system for most of his life, 
Judge Leary utilized his expertise to educate the next generation of 
lawyers.
  Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of the Honorable Paul K. 
Leary. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing his commitment 
to justice and the people of Massachusetts.

1032,INTRODUCTION OF THE COREY ADAMS SEARCHLIGHT ACT,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE222,0,Ms. MOORE,"  Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, this week, I introduced the Corey Adams 
Searchlight Act and I rise to urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation which would establish a national Green Alert system at the 
Department of Justice to provide assistance and support to regional, 
state, and local officials as they work to help locate missing 
veterans.
  This legislation is a practical step toward bringing missing veterans 
home safely.
  This issue was brought to my attention by my constituent Corey Adams. 
When Corey went missing, his family knew that something was wrong--
Corey left his eyeglasses, phone, money, and medications at his 
parent's home, where he was last seen. Despite his family filing a 
missing person report within hours of his disappearance, it took eight 
days before the police determined he met the critical missing persons' 
criteria. On April 7, 18 days after his initial disappearance, Corey 
Adams' body was recovered from a pond in a local park just one mile 
from his mother's home.
  After this tragedy, my state of Wisconsin became the first state to 
create a green alert system modeled after the ``Amber'' alert system

abducted children. And the system has already been used to help locate

1033,RECOGNIZING MARFAN AWARENESS MONTH,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE220-4,0,Mr. FITZPATRICK,"  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Americans 
affected by Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue conditions to 
recognize February as Marfan Awareness Month.
  Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condition. About 1 in 5,000 
Americans carries a mutation in gene called fibrillin which results in 
an overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor beta 
or TGFB. The increased TGFB impacts connective tissue and since 
connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome 
features can manifest throughout the body. Patients often have 
disproportionately long limbs, a protruding or indented chest bone, 
curved spine, and loose joints. However, it is not the outward signs 
that concern Marfan syndrome patients, but the effects the condition 
has on internal systems. Most notably, in Marfan patients the large 
artery, known as the aorta, which carries blood away from the heart is 
weakened and prone to enlargement and rupture, which can be fatal. It 
is for this reason that increased awareness of Marfan syndrome can save 
lives.
  While there is currently no cure for Marfan syndrome, efforts are 
underway to enhance our understanding of the condition and improve 
patient care. I applaud the National Institutes of Health, particularly 
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute 
of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases for their research 
efforts in this regard. I encourage NIH to expand research efforts in 
this area.
  Early diagnosis and proper treatment are the keys to managing Marfan 
syndrome and living a full life. I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in supporting a Marfan education and awareness program at the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. We can facilitate proper treatment 
by raising awareness leading to early diagnosis. I urge my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing February as Marfan Awareness Month.

holiday gift drives and fundraisers, and plays a vital role in 
improving the lives of children in the community.
  On Thursday, April 11th, the Plattsburgh Noon Kiwanis Club will be 
celebrating 90 years of service. They have served generations of North 
Country children since their founding back in 1929. On behalf of New 
York's 21st District, I want to congratulate them on this milestone and 
thank them for their long tradition of service.

legacy of Command Sergeant Major Benjamin Camacho Palacios. Mr. 
Palacios was a Retired U.S. Army Command Sergeant Major and will be 
fondly remembered for his many outstanding contributions and 
accomplishments throughout his military and civilian career.
  A dedicated public servant, Mr. Palacios became one of the most 
senior noncommissioned officers serving with various commands both in 
the U.S. and overseas. Primarily serving in leadership positions within 
the Armor Career Management Field, he eventually assumed duty as the 
United States Army Forces Command Sergeant Major on July 27, 1998. He 
was the Army's senior ranking enlisted Soldier in Korea when he was 
honored with the South Korean Order of National Security Merit Gwanbok 
Medal. Command Sergeant Major Palacios was the first enlisted soldier 
to receive the medal since the end of the Korean War. He was also the 
only person who served over five terms on the Department of Veteran 
Affairs Congressional Committee Mandated Advisory Committee for 
Minority Veterans (ACMV).
  On Guam and the Marianas, the personal accomplishments and success of 
native sons and daughters are celebrated and adopted as triumphs for 
everyone in the community. I am deeply saddened by the passing of 
Command Sergeant Major Palacios and I join the people of Guam in 
celebrating his life and legacy. My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, loved ones, and friends. Command Sergeant Major Palacios will 
be deeply missed, and his memory will live on in the hearts of the 
people of Guam.

1036,DENTAL AWARENESS MONTH,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE218,0,Mr. GOSAR,"  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National 
Children's Dental Health Month. Each February, the American Dental 
Association unifies members of our healthcare community to recognize 
the importance of good oral health for our children and many others. As 
a former dentist, I know that quality dental care impacts your overall 
well-being. Proper Oral Health starts with the very first tooth as baby 
teeth are the building blocks to a healthy smile.
  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, almost 
50 percent of children between the ages of 6 to 11 are affected by 
tooth decay. Tooth decay also happens to be the most common chronic 
disease in children. When a child suffers from dental pain, the impact 
is far reaching and can affect critical developmental stages including 
speaking, eating and learning.
  Although tooth decay is widespread, it is preventable. It is 
important to brush your children's teeth twice a day with fluoride 
toothpaste. This year's slogan for National Children's Dental Health 
Month is ``Brush and clean in between to build a healthy smile.'' If we 
as a society take these preventative measures to keep our children 
healthy, we can ultimately reduce healthcare costs and give our future 
generations the confidence they need in life. Please join me in raising 
awareness about the importance of oral health.

men's basketball team, which last weekend clinched their first ever 
Division III NCAA tournament bid.
  On Saturday night, the Red Devils knocked off top-seeded Webster 70-
69 on the road to secure their conference championship, assuring their 
spot in the Division III tournament.
  With just a few weeks remaining in the regular season, the Red Devils 
needed to win out their remaining four games to enter the conference 
tournament, and they did just that.
  The never-give-up spirit embodied by the team is a testament to the 
great work done by Coach Chip Wilde, and I have no doubt it will carry 
them through the NCAA tournament.
  Our community in central Illinois is immensely proud of the historic 
accomplishments of this year's Eureka men's basketball team, and we 
will be cheering them on as they take on the number-one-seeded Nebraska 
Wesleyan this weekend.
  Congratulations, and go Red Devils.

1038,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1541,0,Ms. COLLINS,"  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging 
Committee, I rise today to introduce, with the Committee's Ranking 
Member, Senator Bob Casey, the ``Guardianship Accountability Act of 
2019,'' a bill that would assist States in improving guardianship 
oversight and data collection.
  Protecting older Americans from financial fraud and exploitation has 
long been one of my top priorities as Chairman of the Aging Committee. 
According to the National Center for State


Courts, an estimated 1.3 million adults are under the care of 
guardians--family members or professionals--who control approximately 
$50 billion of their assets. Guardianship is a legal relationship 
created by a court that is designed to protect those with diminished or 
lost capacity. We found, however, that in some cases, the system lacks 
basic protections against inappropriate use of guardianship and abuse 
by those in power, leaving the most vulnerable Americans at risk of 
exploitation.
  In November 2018, the Aging Committee released a bipartisan report 
following a year-long investigation into State guardianship programs. 
Titled, ``Ensuring Trust: Strengthening State Efforts to Overhaul the 
Guardianship Process and Protect Older Americans,'' the report included 
a number of recommendations intended to help stem the wave of 
guardianship abuse, encourage reforms to State systems and restore 
trust in guardianship arrangements.
  Throughout the course of our investigation, we heard harrowing tales 
from families around the Nation who have struggled with abusive 
guardians, unscrupulous individuals exploiting vulnerable Americans for 
their personal profit. Yet we also spoke with families who had 
heartening stories to share--of dedicated and faithful guardians 
stepping up to protect the assets of seniors with dementia and other 
conditions affecting their capacity. A good guardian can provide years 
of support for a protected individual, ensuring a full life directed, 
wherever possible, by the person's own choices and preferences. Once a 
guardianship is imposed, however, the individual's rights are removed, 
and oversight to protect the individual from abuse, neglect and 
exploitation becomes critical.
  Our Committee gathered information, analysis and recommendations from 
States, courts, and organizations representing older Americans and 
those with disabilities around the country. We found signs of progress 
in a number of jurisdictions. For example, in 2017, Maine was the first 
state to enact the Uniform Law Commission's Uniform Guardianship, 
Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrangements Act. Among the 
reforms made to Maine's guardianship system, this legislation 
highlighted the importance of exploring all options to limit or 
preclude the need for guardianship when appropriate, including the use 
of supported decision making. Maine's law also mandates the regular 
review of reports filed by guardians to determine, among other things, 
whether the guardianship should continue and whether the guardian has 
complied with his or her duties.
  Yet stories in the news continue to call our attention to this 
important issue. Appalling stories, such as that of a guardian from 
Nevada who allegedly used the guardianship process to financially 
exploit more than 150 individuals, and that of another guardian from 
North Carolina who, along with an attorney, an advocate, and a 
professor, took advantage of two men under guardianship and allegedly 
stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, remind us of the 
vulnerabilities created by these relationships and the need for 
diligent oversight.
  In the course of the Committee's investigation, we received more than 
100 comments identifying gaps in the system and, most important, 
offering solutions. The Committee found a pattern of barriers to proper 
oversight and a need for greater use of alternatives to guardianship. 
We found persistent and widespread challenges that require a nationwide 
focus in order to ensure the guardianship system works on behalf of the 
individuals it is intended to protect. The Committee's report outlines 
policy recommendations at local, state and federal levels that would 
improve outcomes for Americans subject to guardianship.
  The Guardianship Accountability Act, which we are introducing today, 
addresses many of the report's recommendations. The bill would direct 
the Elder Justice Coordinating Council to establish a National Online 
Resource Center on Guardianship to collect and publish information 
relevant to guardianship for use by guardians, individuals subject to 
guardianship, as well as courts, states, local governments, and 
community organizations. The resource center would also publish model 
legislation and best practices developed pursuant to the Elder Abuse 
Prevention and Prosecution Act, compile and publish training materials 
for guardians, share research related to guardianship, and maintain a 
database on state laws regarding guardianship and the use of less 
restrictive alternatives. In addition, our legislation would also 
expand the availability of federal demonstration grants established by 
the Elder Justice Act, so funds can be used for developing state 
guardianship databases, for training for court visitors, and for 
sharing information on guardian background checks.
  Combating financial abuse and exploitation of seniors requires law 
enforcement and social service agencies at all levels of government to 
work together, and the bipartisan Guardianship Accountability Act 
promotes this kind of collaboration. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bipartisan legislation.

1039,BEER CAN APPRECIATION/ALUMINUM BILL,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-6,0,Mr. BUCK,"  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the critical role 
that brewers and beer importers play in our Nation's economy.
  American beverage companies and brewers employ more than 2.2 million 
people nationwide, providing more than $103 billion in wages and 
benefits. In my home State of Colorado, breweries have become a 
significant component of my State's culture and economy.
  But in order to compete, American beverage companies and brewers need 
a fair and transparent pricing system for aluminum. That is why I along 
with my friend, Mr. Lawson from Florida, are introducing legislation 
this week giving the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
oversight authority of the aluminum market. These unfair market 
practices have not only cost the beverage and brewing industries 
hundreds of millions of dollars, they have also had harmful effects on 
consumers.
  With the help of the CFTC, I hope we can resolve these pricing 
irregularities that have been plaguing the market so our Nation's 
beverage companies and brewers can continue to produce some of 
America's most popular beverages.

1040,GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2241-3,0,Ms. WEXTON,"  Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, several years ago, I had a conversation with 
one of my constituents that I think about often.
  She told me about when she sent her 5-year-old son off to his first 
week of kindergarten in the Loudoun County Public Schools. He came home 
from school one day, and he told her: Mommy, we had an emergency drill 
today. My place to hide is behind the backpacks.
  Like a backpack is going to stop a round from an AR-15.
  And she decided right then and there that we need to do better for 
our kids and that she needed to do something. Her way of doing 
something was to start the Loudoun chapter of Moms Demand Action.
  Now she and millions more like her have sent us here to do something 
about gun violence.
  We may not be able to stop every school shooting, every act of gun 
violence, but shouldn't we at least try to stop some? Because if we 
won't do that we shouldn't be here.
  Today, for the first time in decades, the United States Congress will 
vote on meaningful gun violence prevention legislation. We will vote on 
and pass H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and I 
will proudly vote ``yes'' because these checks will save lives.

wellness coaches.
  Approximately 70 percent of healthcare dollars in the United States 
are spent on lifestyle-related diseases; but health and wellness 
coaches can decrease those costs by helping people achieve their 
personal health and wellness goals.
  Far too many people suffer and struggle with poor health because they 
don't have the motivation and resources or sustained support needed in


order to transform their habits. Healthy habits are not always easily 
achievable when a patient is working alone, but health coaches are 
there to ensure people succeed in taking control of their health 
issues.
  That is why, earlier in February, Congressman Mullin and I introduced 
a bipartisan resolution to express our support for health and wellness 
coaches. I am proud of our work together as co-chairs of the 
Congressional Men's Health Caucus, and I encourage my colleagues to 
join us in recognizing America's health and wellness coaches.

1042,REQUIRE NICS TO REPORT TO ICE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2266,0,Mr. CLINE,"  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I was disappointed in the passage of H.R. 8 
just a few moments ago, which will do nothing to address the rash of 
mass shootings that have occurred across this country in recent years 
but will place impediments in the way of law-abiding citizens acquiring 
firearms and in defense of their Second Amendment rights. But I was 
pleased that the motion to recommit was adopted.
  That motion was based on an amendment I offered in committee to 
require the national instant background system to report to ICE when an 
illegal immigrant tries to obtain a firearm in violation of current 
law. I was pleased that it received 220 votes.
  I have drafted it as a standalone bill. I will offer it for 
cosponsorship. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the 
bill and ensuring those not here legally who try to purchase a gun are 
reported to ICE and deported before they commit additional crimes.

1044,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1519-3,0,Mr. BLUNT,"  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I just listened to the other debate on the 
floor, and it reminded me of the fact that our friends on the other 
side of the aisle introduced a resolution calling on the Federal 
Government to adopt what they call the Green New Deal.
  From my point of view, the legislation is pretty far outside the 
mainstream in what it is proposing and how it is proposing the problems 
we should be debating. I don't have any problem with that. Those 
problems should be solved, and even though it seems pretty far outside 
the mainstream of thought, at least 12 of our colleagues in the Senate 
have cosponsored it. The majority leader thought it would be fair if we 
had that idea out there--it is


getting a lot of public attention--to have a chance to debate this 
legislation and vote on it in the Senate.
  The Democrats have called it a sham. They said: Why should we have 
debate on this piece of legislation? Why would we want to vote on this 
piece of legislation?
  Now, it is not cosponsored by a majority of the Members of the 
Senate, but it is cosponsored by over 25 percent of the Democrats in 
the Senate, and one would think that if 25 percent of their conference 
is sponsoring a bill, they would be glad to come to the floor and talk 
about that bill and talk about what it does.
  So let's talk for just a couple of minutes about what that bill 
actually says. One of the things that it does is that it calls for the 
United States to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. That is just 
a little more than 10 years from now. It says, basically, that we want 
to have a zero-carbon-dioxide emissions by then.
  I know there was some discussion in the rolling out of this bill that 
that would mean that ground transportation and air transportation would 
either be eliminated or minimized--at least the way we travel right now 
would be. At some point in the future that may happen, but it is highly 
unlikely it is going to happen in the next 10 years, which is what the 
bill calls for. Maybe that is why they don't want to debate it. Even 
President Obama's former science adviser says that this is not 
feasible. Harvard University professor John Holdren was quoted in the 
New York Times saying: ``As a technologist studying this problem for 50 
years, I don't think we can do it.''
  So that is a pretty good source who indicates that what we are 
talking about here can't happen. So that big headline goal appears to 
be impossible, but we probably could debate it anyway. Let's hear from 
the other side, particularly the 12 cosponsors, to say why it is 
possible, why we should be able to do that, and why that is in the 
legislation that they filed.
  The rest of the legislation goes really beyond things that don't 
relate to the environment. There is a laundry list of policies that 
appear to be popular right now in the so-called progressive discussion. 
One is a single-payer health system and the other is a Federal job 
guarantee. The talking points suggested that that would be a Federal 
job guarantee for people who can't work or aren't willing to work. Of 
course, that was so controversial that immediately people began to say: 
Well, maybe that is something that the Republicans snuck into our 
talking points. But it turned out that wasn't true.
  There is a provision calling for ``repairing the historic oppression 
of . . . youth.'' That is sort of what this whole Green New Deal seems 
to focus on--accepting responsibility in a debate for things that 
really don't make the kind of sense one would want them to make as you 
move toward legislation. They don't really say what the ``historic 
oppression of youth'' was. Probably that is not related to the economy 
or the environment or the greenness of the Green New Deal.
  But even if we agree that these ideas are good ideas, the other 
question is this: How much is it going to cost?
  The American Action Forum looked at the biggest parts of the 
legislation, and they estimated that the total would run anywhere from 
$51 trillion to $94 trillion over 10 years. To put this in perspective, 
the Congress right now appropriates about $1.5 trillion a year. We 
spend more than that through programs that are in place like Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but we appropriate $1.5 trillion a 
year. If the estimates of the Green New Deal are right, that would 
suddenly become $5 trillion to $9 trillion a year. That is a pretty 
good multiplier of $1.5 trillion a year--six times, in fact, of what we 
are spending now--at the $9 trillion level. That works out to be about 
$65,000 per family per year. That would probably be more government 
than we could afford, but that is how it works out.
  There is nothing that talks about how families are supposed to come 
up with their share of the bill.
  While some of the ideas in the Green New Deal--Medicare for all or a 
job for everybody, guaranteed by the government--sound like good ideas, 
I don't think they are going to stand the test of the debate. I think 
that is one of the reasons that maybe the other side doesn't want to 
have the debate.
  Some talk about: Well, maybe we will all vote present or we will not 
vote at all.
  I think it is pretty hard to defend what you are out there talking 
about when you are not willing to come to the floor and talk about it. 
That is a debate we are going to have. I suspect we are going to have 
it sometime this month, and I look forward to engaging in that debate.
  This week, we are having another debate on nominees. Right now, the 
debate is on the nominee for the Administrator of the EPA. There has 
been some discussion of the environment in the debate on the 
Administrator of the EPA. Next, we are going to go to someone to serve 
on the TVA commission. This is somebody who has been voted out of 
committee two times in bipartisan voice votes and never allowed to have 
a vote in the Senate.
  I will remind my colleagues again that under President Reagan, the 
average time in days from when a person was voted out of committee--and 
remember, as all of us on the floor would know, the committee is where 
questions are asked, and the background check has been completed. That 
may take a substantial amount of time, depending on the nominee and how 
complicated their information is--sometimes less time, sometimes more. 
That has all happened in the committee.
  Under President Reagan, the average number of days from the time a 
person was voted out of committee until they were voted on, on the 
floor was 5. The total number of times the majority had to file cloture 
to get that vote was less than a handful in the entire first 2 years.
  For President Trump, the average number of days for a nominee to be 
voted on is 55, and the majority leader had to file cloture 128 times 
even to get a vote. We are going through some of those votes this week. 
The 30 hours of debate almost never includes debate about the nominee 
who is using up floor time that could be used for debating how we spend 
our money, how we defend our country, or what our foreign policy 
oversight responsibilities are going to be.
  We are going to continue to look at the options and continue to talk 
to our friends on the other side about how 60 Senators can work 
together to change the rules in a way that they would be changed going 
forward to get the rules back more to the days of Ronald Reagan, George 
Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and all of their predecessors, where 
nominees were never used as a way to use up time. Nominees were never 
held hostage so that other legislation or debate couldn't occur.
  We are working hard to find 60 of us who want to return to a time 
when legislative priorities in the Senate still had the protections of 
the minority that have always been there, but those protections 
couldn't be used to the disadvantage of people who have stepped up and 
are willing to serve and are often voted out of committee on a 
bipartisan basis, only to be held up on the floor.
  I look forward to the debate on the Green New Deal. I look forward to 
the other debates we are going to have on the floor of the Senate this 
year.
  For the people who are willing to serve, who have been reported out 
of committee, who have been thoroughly questioned and investigated but 
can't get that vote and get to work, that is not what we want to do. 
That is not who we should want to be. I hope we can work together to 
find a way to change that rule as well.
  I see my good friend, the Senator from Hawaii, is here. We are 
working on some things together right now that we would like to get to 
the floor and have those bills voted on later.

1046,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1519-3,2,Mr. SCHATZ,"  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank 
him for his leadership and levelheadedness.
  As he is on his way out, I will say that I think the current way we 
deal with nominees is not tenable. I imagine a scenario where we have a 
Democratic President, and it will take even longer than it is currently 
taking to confirm nominees. I think there are a number of us on both 
sides of the aisle who are open to modifying the way we operate.


  For me, the blue-slip question is a redline. I think what they are 
doing with the blue slips undermines the individual ability for any 
Senator to have their say, especially as it relates to the circuit 
courts, but I think there is an opportunity to have a conversation.
  On climate generally, I am looking forward to a debate, but it is 
very difficult to debate in the Senate when only one party proffers a 
proposal. I don't mean this as rhetorical flourish. I don't mean this 
as a personal accusation or a partisan attack. It is just a fact that 
there are no climate proposals coming from the Senators who are 
Republican. There are zero. So they are trying to have a debate about a 
resolution which was nonbinding and which was signed by 12 Senators. I 
get it, but I think, given that this is the world's greatest 
deliberative body, we ought to have a proper debate about climate 
change.
  We are actually in a climate emergency. This is the most important 
moment in the world's history as it relates to this particular crisis. 
We are sitting here trying to score points about an FAQ that was posted 
on a new Congresswoman's website and trying to make fun of each other 
and say: They are going to ban cows and ice cream. It is very silly, 
and it is not worthy of the seriousness of the moment.
  I would ask my Republican colleagues--I see a number of them who take 
the debt, foreign policy, cyber security, personal privacy, and the 
rules of the Senate very seriously. They are very levelheaded human 
beings with a seriousness of purpose. Yet when it comes to climate 
change, it gets into this goofy thing where they are doing everything 
except debating climate change and what ought to be done about it.
  We spent 5, maybe 10 years trying to get most Republicans to concede 
that this problem exists at all. Now a lot of them are feeling 
comfortable saying: Yes, this problem exists, but all of the solutions 
proposed by Democrats are wrong.
  That is fine, but I ask this question in all sincerity: What do 
Republican Senators propose to do about the climate crisis? What is 
your plan? If you don't like cap and trade; if you don't like a fee on 
carbon; if you don't like massive investment in green technology and 
clean technology; if you don't like the extension of the investment tax 
credit and the production tax credit; if you don't like our solution; 
if you don't like being part of the Paris climate accord--which, by the 
way, is nonbinding, which means we get to decide what our pathway is to 
clean energy. It is not as though the U.N. gets to tell us what to do. 
It gives us leverage to make sure that as we move forward toward clean 
energy, the other countries don't cheat. It actually gives us leverage 
in this situation.
  If you don't like our solutions, that is fine. This is the world's 
greatest deliberative body. This is where the greatest debates in U.S. 
history have happened. Yet, maybe 19 times out of 20, I have come down 
to the floor to talk about climate change, and there were Members on 
this side of the aisle and zero Members on the other side of the aisle. 
Again, I don't mean this as an attack; I just want a real debate.
  I am looking at the Senator from Georgia. We have had robust 
discussions about debt and deficits and the way we try to avoid 
shutdowns and sequester and all the rest of it. When it comes to 
climate change, everybody gets really goofy. Everybody puts on their 
partisan uniform and refuses to engage. If this debate about the Green 
New Deal offers us an opportunity to talk about the planetary crisis, 
then I am happy for it.
  We are in debate time on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead the 
EPA, so it might be helpful to know the origins of the Agency.
  In the 1960s, the state of the environment was catastrophic. Millions 
of freshwater fish and rivers around the country were being poisoned by 
insecticides, hurting consumer trust and the countless fishermen and 
families who made a living that way. Pollution was so bad that debris 
floating in the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, causing 
thousands of dollars in property damage. The water in Lake Superior 
became so toxic from companies' dumping asbestos-laden waste that local 
communities had to start filtering their own water. Think about that. 
People could drink the water from their local reservoirs unfiltered 
until industrial pollution came along.
  This was the path our country was on. Pollution was destroying many 
of the most beautiful places in the country and, maybe more 
importantly, putting the health of the public at risk.

  A scientist named Rachel Carson came along and changed everything 
when she wrote a book that helped the United States see that we 
couldn't go on like this. Her book was a call for change, and millions 
of Americans, on a bipartisan basis, demanded change.
  There was a predictable backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman 
said as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:

       The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book ``Silent 
     Spring'' are gross distortions of the actual facts, 
     completely unsupported by scientific, experimental evidence, 
     and general practical experience in the field. Her suggestion 
     that pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is 
     obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without 
     selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely 
     useless.

  This controversy went on for the next few years. The public, the 
science, and the reality pointed toward the truth, but a few loud 
voices tried to stop the country from making progress. They said that 
Rachel Carson distorted the facts, that the science wasn't there, and 
that there was no need to rush judgment.
  The U.S. Government moved forward anyway and began to lay the 
foundation for a new America--one that would preserve and protect our 
country and its resources for the next generation.
  In 1970, President Nixon united several offices and bureaus already 
in the Federal Government into one single agency, the EPA. The EPA was 
charged with protecting the Nation's health and being the steward of 
the environment. It has a legacy of fulfilling that mission. The Agency 
ended the use of a dangerous pesticide called DDT. It found a solution 
to acid rain, which was once a major issue for fish, forests, and 
farming. It took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor public 
places.
  Thanks to the EPA, Rachel Carson's ``fable for tomorrow'' did not 
become a reality, but here we are decades later facing another 
environmental crisis, one that affects the United States and every 
other Nation on this planet, and I am worried that we are not going to 
do the right thing this time.
  Instead of facing head-on and in a bipartisan way the biggest crisis 
in the planet's history, the party in power is not just ignoring the 
problem; they are making it worse. And they are doing it by nominating 
and confirming people like Andrew Wheeler. This is someone who said: 
``Manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the 
American people.'' This is the guy to head the EPA. He says manmade 
global warming is a hoax. This is someone who was formally the vice 
president of the Washington Coal Club, who lobbied for coal companies.
  We are in a planetary emergency, and Republicans want someone who is 
advancing the interests of top polluters to be the Nation's chief 
environmental steward so that he can continue to advance the interest 
of the top polluters. Again, it is not just that they are ignoring 
climate change, which would be bad enough; it is that they are 
aggressively, proudly, gleefully sometimes, making it worse.
  Researchers at Harvard found that the EPA's recent plans to gut the 
Clean Power Plan will lead to more greenhouse gas emissions. Their plan 
will be worse for climate than if they did nothing at all. Think about 
that. If the EPA did nothing at all, it would be better than what they 
are doing now. This is the result of Mr. Wheeler's leadership, which 
has until now been in an Acting Director capacity.
  During the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, the EPA was led by Anne 
Gorsuch Burford, who ended up resigning in scandal. President Reagan 
nominated as her replacement William Ruckelshaus, whom people trusted 
to do the job and stabilize the EPA. He was a moderate. He was a steady 
hand. The EPA could use a steady hand after Scott Pruitt, who promoted 
the interests of polluters over the health of the American people and 
who crossed many ethical lines. Yet Andrew Wheeler is no Ruckelshaus. 
That much is clear from his time at the EPA. Under his leadership, EPA 
inspections are at a 10-year


low. EPA fines are at a 25-year low. Restrictions on new coal plants 
have been eliminated. Limits on methane pollution are in the process of 
being rolled back. In other words, polluters are getting their way. 
That is great news for people who own oil and gas companies, but it is 
horrible news for people with asthma, for farmers who are trying to get 
through the worst drought season seen in a century, and for small 
businesses that are losing customers because of fires.

  Listen, climate change is here. It is hurting everything from local 
economies, to public health, to national security, and the Republicans 
have decided that the best person to lead the Agency to do something 
about it is a coal lobbyist. It would be funny if it were not so 
outrageous.
  The Democrats have a plan for climate change. We have ideas to invest 
in clean air, clean water, and smarter infrastructure. We have bills on 
investment and production tax credits, solar energy, wind energy, 
conservation and efficiency, carbon pricing, and planting trees, and we 
have stood together against nominations like this one. It is time for 
the Republicans, if not to stand with us, to at least then stand on the 
other side against us and engage in this great debate. What are we 
going to do with climate change? We have proposals, and they have none.

                            Disaster Relief
",,2019-02-27
1048,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1519-3,4,Mr. PERDUE,"  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a crisis in my home 
State and indeed five other States across the Southeast. I rise to talk 
about disasters in California and to talk about our friends in Puerto 
Rico.
  On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida 
Panhandle as a category 4 hurricane. It was one of the strongest storms 
to ever hit the United States. Over the next few hours, Hurricane 
Michael barreled through Florida and tore through southwest Georgia. In 
a matter of minutes, homes were flattened, tracks of timber were 
destroyed, and farmers' crops lay down in the field. People's lives 
were radically affected forever.
  This hurricane hit at exactly the time of year when most crops were 
ready for harvest. It doesn't matter if they were peanuts, cotton, or 
pecans--they were all just beautiful this year. As a matter of fact, in 
the State of Georgia, I grew up working on our family's farm there, and 
I have to say the cotton crop last year was probably the best I had 
ever seen. It was almost cruel. Today, agriculture is Georgia's top 
industry and our No. 1 economic driver. Before the hurricane, farmers 
in my State were expecting a record harvest. Instead, their crops were 
completely destroyed.
  Shortly after the hurricane hit, President Trump, Vice President 
Pence, and Secretary of Agriculture Perdue all came down to Georgia. 
Together, we toured the devastation and heard from farmers and local 
officials about the tough road of recovery ahead. Some farmers said 
they could clean up, replant, and have a crop next year as long as they 
had adequate resources. Other farmers were not so lucky.
  Georgia is the top pecan-producing State in the country. One of our 
largest pecan farms is owned by two brothers in Bainbridge, which the 
Vice President and I personally visited. We personally saw the damage 
in their fields. Some 800 acres of pecan trees were gone. I cannot 
describe to you what that looks like. On the ground was a solid 
carpet--if you can imagine this--of mature, beautiful, inch-long pecans 
that were ready to be harvested but were on the ground, ruined.
  One brother said:

       The farmer in me wants to farm this land, but there's no 
     way I can make it. Next year is the year I'll lose it, 
     because we're not like the cotton guy. Nothing against them, 
     but they get to replant a seed next year and have a crop. I 
     don't.

  The problem is that the pecan crop can be annually insured, but there 
is no insurance product for insuring pecan trees. If these two brothers 
replant, it could take 7 to 10 years for the trees to mature enough to 
even generate a minimum revenue. Most likely, full production would 
take over 12 years. For them, this is truly a generational loss.
  The other brother said:

       My brother and I built this business from nothing. We will 
     make it. We may not be in the pecan business anymore, but 
     we will be doing something else. We are fighters. [Our 
     families are committed to this land.] You just have to go 
     on.

  When they saw the devastation, President Trump and Vice President 
Pence stepped up to the plate and made a commitment to our agriculture 
community.
  President Trump said: ``Farmers really got hurt here, especially in 
Georgia, but we're going to get it taken care of.''
  Vice President Pence said:

       We will rebuild these crops and these communities. We will 
     restore southwest Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt region 
     bigger and better than ever before.

  This afternoon, I am here to say that the Vice President and the 
President are living up to their word. After this disaster relief was 
caught up in the political nightmare of funding the last 25 percent of 
this year's budget, we now have the opportunity to put this standalone 
supplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. The 
President and Vice President have been absolutely resolute in their 
support of getting aid to the victims of these disasters. They are now 
asking Congress to pass this all-inclusive disaster relief bill right 
now.
  The State of Georgia has already stepped up and offered tax credits, 
short-term financing, and other forms of direct assistance to those who 
have been impacted, but they have only scratched the surface. The 
people of Georgia have come together and helped their neighbors, served 
meals to each other, and assisted first responders in their recovery 
efforts.
  In Florida alone, then-Governor Rick Scott, who is now our colleague 
here on the Senate floor, was in the race for this Senate seat, and he 
actually suspended his campaign to devote all of his time, in his 
responsibility as the Governor, to lead the effort of analyzing the 
damage in Florida and determining what needed to be done. He can speak 
directly to the need. He is a cosponsor of this bill, I might add.
  However, despite efforts by Senator Isakson and others and me in our 
State, this Senate body has yet to take action on disaster relief for 
the agriculture community in the Southeast. Our farmers simply cannot 
wait any longer. The situation in my State is dire. I would say it is 
the same across the South. Because revenue from the 2018 harvest was 
destroyed, bankers can't lend money to farmers who right now are asking 
to borrow money to put seed in the ground, to fertilize the ground, and 
to prepare the ground for next year's crop. It is as simple as that. 
Growers cannot replant because they can't get their financial houses in 
order because we haven't adopted a resolution for last year's harvest 
that they were not able to achieve. Rural communities are suffering, 
and in many places, economic activity is at an absolute standstill as 
it waits for the Federal Government--this body and the House of 
Representatives--to do its job.
  For some in my State, the timing of assistance is not just a matter 
of putting a crop in the ground this year; it is a matter of 
potentially never putting a crop in the ground again. If we do not help 
these people right now, they may lose their businesses and livelihoods 
through no fault of their own. That is the reality we are facing here. 
The people in my State have asked me to utilize every sphere of 
influence, turn over every stone, and exhaust all options to get 
disaster relief right now.
  We are past the time when this should have gotten done. I have spoken 
with the President many times about this. His commitment to our farmers 
is unwavering. Just last Monday night, he said: David, get it done. He 
called me again on Saturday night before he left for Vietnam. He said: 
David, what do we have to do to get this bill across the Senate floor? 
Talk to our friends in the House, and make sure that everything that is 
needed is in.
  Senator Isakson, I, and several other Senators have introduced a 
supplemental disaster relief bill on the floor of the Senate, and 
President Trump has agreed to sign it. Our bill includes disaster 
relief for agriculture. It also provides additional funds for Georgia 
and other States like Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas, Alaska, Hawaii, 
and California that have battled natural disasters over the last year 
on


their own. It also builds on the Trump administration's past efforts 
and includes the remaining funding for Puerto Rico.
  Both the House and Senate have previously supported similar 
proposals. They should be even more inclined to do so now that it is 
not tied up with the overall 2019 budget drama. This is a standalone 
supplemental bill that includes those things that people on both sides 
of this body agreed to and voted for just last year. This bipartisan 
package is a win for our farmers. It is a win for families and 
businesses that were devastated by historic hurricanes in the Southeast 
and wildfires in the West. It is a win for the people of Puerto Rico 
whom the President has previously helped. He was committed to including 
that in this bill.
  I sincerely hope this body will move quickly and pass this disaster 
relief bill without further delay. I humbly ask each of my colleagues 
in this body for their individual support and for their vote in this 
disaster relief package that will save hundreds, if not thousands, of 
farming families in my home State from having to give up what they 
love, and that is farming the land that in many cases they inherited 
from their families. In other cases, people who graduated from HBCUs--
some of our brightest young people--borrowed money to buy the land or 
are leasing the land, and they are in danger of losing this dream of 
making a living on the ground in Georgia.
  Our country and our people are counting on us to get this done, and 
time is of the essence.

                      Nomination of Andrew Wheeler
",,2019-02-27
1052,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1519-3,8,Ms. DUCKWORTH,"  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I come to the floor in opposition to 
Andrew Wheeler's nomination to lead the Environmental Protection 
Agency.
  Americans across this country depend on EPA to protect their public 
health, yet under this administration, EPA has failed again and again 
to reassure my constituents that their basic rights to breathe in clean 
air and sip clean water are being prioritized.
  Listen, I am proud that EPA's Region 5 office is headquartered in 
Chicago. Region 5 has led the country in enforcing the Clean Air Act, 
the Clean Water Act, and other bedrock environmental policies that 
Congress has passed. But under Mr. Wheeler and this administration, EPA 
has made it harder for the scientists, engineers, and public health 
experts in Region 5 to do their jobs.
  EPA is severely understaffed and underfunded, and in 2018, major 
enforcement actions dropped to their lowest levels in more than 10 
years. Last year, EPA competed fewer than 11,000 inspections and 
evaluations of polluters across the country--the lowest number in 
almost two decades.
  In 2018, EPA sent just 123 civil pollution violation cases to the 
Justice Department for prosecution. That is about 40 percent less than 
the annual average during the Obama administration. So, sadly, it 
should come as no surprise that a report from the Environmental 
Integrity Project this month found that communities across the country 
are now being put at risk of exposure to dangerous contaminants.
  To make matters worse, the EPA's enforcement workforce has been 
shrinking for years, and the Trump administration wants to cut it back 
even further.
  These cutbacks are leaving communities, especially low-income 
communities and those of color, exposed to public health risks. 
Meanwhile, polluters are being let off the hook for serious violations 
of the law.
  I have seen firsthand what happens when EPA fails to enforce our laws 
and protect public health. It causes fear and confusion. For months, 
residents in Willowbrook, IL, have lived in fear that the air they 
breathe in has been making their family sick.
  Here is a little background. A facility in their community has been 
releasing cancer-causing emissions for decades. Unfortunately, even 
since EPA discovered just how toxic this chemical was years ago--years 
ago--they have refused to issue new regulations updating safety 
standards based on the latest science.
  Making matters even worse, EPA officials refused to notify local 
public health or elected officials about their discovery, leaving 
communities in the dark even while their health is at risk, leaving 
more families more likely to get sick, leaving more children more 
likely to die.
  As a mother, this is heartbreaking. As a Senator, this is outrageous.
  When Willowbrook residents first started to raise concerns, EPA 
wasn't the least bit transparent. The Agency had to be pushed by 
Senator Durbin, other Members of the Illinois congressional delegation, 
and me just to hold community forums.
  My office also received alarming information alleging that senior 
political appointees instructed EPA personnel not to inspect any 
facility in Region 5 that emits the same carcinogen found at this 
facility. If true, this type of political interference is beyond 
unacceptable. If true, it is happening on Mr. Wheeler's watch.
  I have asked EPA to take several steps to fix this crisis, and I am 
still waiting for their response.
  In the absence of leadership from EPA, Senator Durbin and I have 
authored two pieces of legislation to ensure that this kind of crisis 
never happens again.
  Here is what Gabriela, a resident of Willowbrook, said when she saw 
the list of health problems associated with this facility: ``It was 
like reading our medical history.''
  Since she moved to her home in 2009, Gabriela has suffered from 
intense headaches, dizziness, nausea, inability to concentrate, and 
memory loss. She has found it difficult to read through briefs and 
almost instantly forgets movie plots and even some conversations.
  Both of her children, who have lived in the house for most of their 
lives, have had respiratory problems since they were little. Her 12-
year-old daughter has often coughed to the point of vomiting and has 
developed a bone cyst.
  One of her 9-year-old daughter's classmates was recently diagnosed 
with leukemia, as was Gabriella's next-door neighbor, an otherwise 
healthy man in his early fifties.
  Another woman I have gotten to know from Willowbrook is named 
Neringa. She told me that when she and her husband were moving to 
Chicago 5 years ago, they picked their home because it seemed like a 
place where their children would be safe.
  She went on:

       You look for sexual predators, good schools, taxes. You 
     don't think you would have to look at air and water. You feel 
     like it is the one thing in our country we wouldn't have to 
     think about.

  Exposure from toxic pollution is a matter of life and death for these 
residents. It was uncovered only when career civil servants did their 
job and flagged a risk they observed in a routine model that EPA 
publishes.
  I am extremely concerned that other areas in Illinois could face 
similar issues and that other kids in other communities could be 
breathing in air full of cancer-causing chemicals when they are playing 
on the swings at recess or walking home from school later that 
afternoon.
  I need EPA to respond to the requests I have made on behalf of Lake 
County and actually conduct the kind of monitoring that exposed the 
problem in Willowbrook there and in every community that may be at 
risk.
  Not far from Willowbrook, residents in Chicago have also been facing 
several public health threats for decades.
  Chicago, IL, is the birthplace of Hazel Johnson, the ``Mother of the 
Environmental Justice Movement,'' a pioneer of environmental justice 
activism on the South Side of Chicago.
  She founded People for Community Recovery in 1979 in an effort to get 
asbestos out of the buildings in her community. Soon she managed to 
trace air and water pollution in her community to nearby industry, 
which was using the predominantly lower income African-American 
community as a dumping ground.
  Hazel Johnson knew what I know: Every American has a right to breathe 
in safe air, drink clean water, and live


on uncontaminated land, no matter where they live, no matter the color 
of their skin, no matter their tax bracket.
  Yet I still hear about manganese pollution, petcoke, particulate 
matter, and lead exposure from these residents on a daily basis.
  Chicago residents deserve--no, they need--environmental justice. But 
for some reason, this administration has dismantled the office that is 
supposed to lead this work, even trying to eliminate EPA's 
environmental justice funding and drive out the office's top talent.
  Lead exposure is an issue that impacts low-income families and 
communities of color disproportionately. I had high hopes that I would 
be able to work with Mr. Wheeler on the administration's response to 
this crisis. Yet after months and months of delays, I am very 
disappointed by their so-called plan.
  Mr. Wheeler's lead action plan falls short of what was promised and 
the ``war on lead'' his predecessor declared. This is not a plan with 
goals, strategies, and deadlines. Instead, it is a repackaged version 
of a report published under the Obama administration. Little has 
changed, other than the window dressing.
  What disappointed me most was that the administration appears to be 
walking back our goal of eliminating lead exposure, settling simply for 
reducing it. That is unacceptable.
  Even to this day, in a post-Flint crisis world, too many in power are 
sitting idly by as countless Americans are exposed to lead. More than 6 
million homes get water from lead service lines, and 24 million homes 
have lead hazards in paint, dust, or soil. Nearly half a million 
children have elevated levels of lead in their blood.
  Let's be clear. For children, there is no safe level of lead 
allowable in drinking water. Even low levels can cause permanent brain 
damage in kids, lowering IQ, and inflicting other cognitive damage. 
Imagine if your child were one of those who had gotten sick because the 
EPA refused to take action on such an obvious crisis. Imagine how 
infuriating, how devastating that would be.
  We must make meaningful progress in tackling sources of exposure, and 
EPA must take up an aggressive, comprehensive, and practical strategy.
  I know we can make real progress in reducing lead in our society, but 
the new lead action plan is a missed opportunity to advance those 
efforts.
  I also believe that Mr. Wheeler has far too many conflicts of 
interest to be running the EPA. As a former lobbyist for Murray Energy, 
Mr. Wheeler has worked closely with the industries he would regulate as 
the leader of the EPA. It is well reported that Mr. Wheeler's former 
firm lobbied the EPA on efforts Wheeler now oversees.
  Even after he took temporary reins of the EPA, he made no secret of 
meeting with former clients and fossil fuel industry representatives. 
CNN and Reuters have both reported that Wheeler is heavily prioritizing 
meetings with industry over anyone else and has attended more than 50 
meetings with companies or industry groups that EPA regulates.
  If this news doesn't alarm you, it may be because corruption is 
becoming routine under this administration. After all, just earlier 
this week, the Washington Post reported that the Assistant 
Administrator for Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, has been routinely 
meeting with former clients in the fossil fuel industry from his not-
so-long-ago lobbying days.
  I placed a hold on Mr. Wehrum's nomination because I did not think he 
could be trusted with our Nation's air. I feel the same way about Mr. 
Wheeler's leading the EPA.
  According to the Sierra Club, every third day during his first 100 
days as Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler either, one, rolled back a 
new climate policy; two, ignored or contradicted science; three, met 
with big polluters; four, limited the EPA's ability to protect us from 
pollution; or, five, gave in to corporate polluter demands--all of that 
in just his first 3 months and change. Imagine what would happen if we 
gave him the reins for good.
  Mr. Wheeler's position on climate change policy alone is 
disqualifying. Consider, for example, his attack on the Clean Power 
Plan. Climate change is a major threat to our environment, our economy, 
and our national security--something that even Donald Trump's own 
intelligence officials admit.
  My home State of Illinois is already experiencing the consequences of 
inaction. Growing seasons are changing, heat waves are increasing, and 
extreme floods are becoming more frequent and more severe. Just this 
December we had a hurricane. Mitigating these effects will require 
sensible policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in 
clean energy.
  Under the Clean Water Act, EPA is legally required to limit carbon 
pollution from powerplants, pollution that we know is the primary 
driver of climate change.
  That is why the Obama administration established a Clean Power Plan--
to provide States the flexibility they need to meet a national goal of 
32 percent reductions in carbon pollution by 2030. This plan was the 
culmination of robust and rigorous public participation, and EPA 
received millions of comments supporting the program from States, 
through its utilities, communities of color, Tribes, environmental 
groups, labor unions, and the public at large.
  The Clean Power Plan was not only good for the environment; it was 
good for the economy, too. In Illinois, residents are expected to save 
an average of up to 4 percent on electricity bills by 2030. Illinois 
energy efficiency investments alone are estimated to grow our economy 
by $2 billion in that same year, and we lead the Midwest in clean 
energy jobs.
  But no matter the obvious global, national, and economic benefits, 
Mr. Wheeler has led the administration's efforts to roll back the Clean 
Power Plan. His replacement proposal would adversely impact public 
health and lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths from increased 
soot, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, and 100,000 
missed school and work days annually by 2030.
  Internationally, this proposal would leave the United States further 
behind our allies that have taken aggressive action on climate change. 
The proposal also fails low-income communities and communities of 
color, which bear the brunt of our environmental and public health 
burdens. Unlike the Clean Power Plan, this platform doesn't even 
require States to engage environmental justice and community groups in 
their plan development processes. It also fails to encourage States to 
conduct environmental justice analysis of their own as they develop 
implementation plans.
  EPA should be working to strengthen policies like the Clean Power 
Plan. It is more than troubling that Mr. Wheeler and the Trump 
administration are instead seeking to repeal them entirely. Now is not 
the time to move backward.
  Here is what Evan, who grew up in Libertyville, IL, shared with me:

       I write because I am concerned about the future. The future 
     of the world, the future for the United States and my own 
     future. At this time, I feel that perhaps the greatest threat 
     to that future is climate change. The current 
     Administration's stance towards the issue has discouraged me 
     to no end, and I can't help but despair as the President 
     makes light of this existential threat to the wellbeing of 
     the planet.
       I know, of course, that not all lawmakers share the 
     President's stance towards this issue. Please, make some 
     noise.

  Evan, I hear you. I hear your fear, and I want you to know that I 
believe the Nation should be focused on building a clean energy economy 
and a climate-safe future for your generation. I hear you, and I am 
going to make that noise for you.
  I am also angry at EPA's abuse of the small refinery waiver program 
under the renewable fuel standard. The RFS includes a policy to help 
small refineries that cannot afford to comply with the RFS. Before 
Donald Trump took power, this policy was rarely used. Under the Trump 
administration, however, nearly every exemption application has been 
secretly granted. This includes applications from large, multibillion 
dollar companies like Exxon and Chevron that are earning record 
profits. These companies' CEOs have even pointed to hardship waivers on 
earnings clauses as contributing to their profitability.
  The administration's stance reduces incentives for blending--slashing 
demands for biofuels and feedstocks--actively hurting farmers and 
biofuels


companies. These waivers could hurt the markets for years to come, 
holding back homegrown biofuels while creating windfall profits for 
large oil refiners--the exact opposite of this administration's promise 
to voters.
  Let's be blunt. EPA is taking money out of farmers' hands and giving 
it to billionaire oil companies. These actions come at a time when 
biofuel producers and farmers across our country are already hurting. 
Farm income is at its lowest since 2006, and retaliatory trade measures 
from China threaten to deepen the crisis.
  Yet early reports indicate that the small refinery waivers EPA has 
granted under President Trump and Mr. Wheeler will reduce demand for 
biofuels by billions. Over the past 6 months, we have seen more ethanol 
plants sold, idled, or closed than ever before. When I asked Mr. 
Wheeler during the confirmation hearing about EPA's apparent change in 
policy to now seemingly granting every exemption application, he made 
excuses justifying them. We need a leader at the EPA who is going to 
stand up for our farmers, not capitulate to the demands of Big Oil.
  We also need a leader at the EPA who is going to protect the Great 
Lakes. The 1,000 employees in Region 5 work tirelessly to protect the 
environment, health, and safety of Americans living in Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. They live, work, and 
raise their families in the communities they protect, and they are 
leaders in the fields of water quality, Superfund cleanup, and Great 
Lakes restoration.
  Region 5 is also home to the Great Lakes Program Office, which 
ensures that we keep the promises we made to Canada under the Great 
Lakes Water Quality Agreement. It also leads the Nation's Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative, which has funded more than 2,000 projects that 
improve water quality, protect wildlife, and clean up toxic pollutants 
that threaten our water supply.
  To date, the program has invested more than $2.2 billion in Great 
Lakes restoration projects. Coordinated in both the United States and 
Canada, GLRI sets the standards for interagency and international 
cooperation. Every $1 invested in Great Lakes restoration results in a 
$2 return in the form of increased fishing, tourism, and home values. 
But in addition to enduring a shutdown, the employees in Region 5 who 
lead these programs have been bought out, undermined, and reorganized 
into positions they are not suited for, and that is unacceptable.
  What is also unacceptable is Mr. Wheeler's attacks on science and 
science integrity. Science does not have a political affiliation. 
Science is about learning, and it never stands still. It gives us the 
building blocks to help us increase our knowledge over time and to find 
ever-better solutions to the challenges we face. Unfortunately, this 
EPA has led the administration's attacks on science when it doesn't fit 
with their pro-polluter agenda.
  What is at stake is not just our health and future but also America's 
standing and influence in the world. Just this month, EPA released the 
names of eight new members of its science advisory board. I am 
concerned that several of the new members represent interests who seek 
to undermine the independence and quality of the scientific advice 
given to the EPA. University researchers are now in the minority on the 
board, while the number of industry-affiliated members and members 
listed as consultants has increased.

  Here is how the Union of Concerned Scientists summarized the new 
appointments made by Wheeler to the Science Advisory Board. Take Dr. 
John Christy. He has a reputation for controversial climate research 
and denying the evidence of global warming.
  Then, there is Dr. Brant Ulsh, a consultant who argues that radiation 
at low doses isn't a big deal, contrary to the conclusions of the 
National Academy of Science.
  New member Dr. Richard Williams has received compensation from the 
American Chemistry Council's formaldehyde panel, which was set up to 
obfuscate the health impacts of this carcinogen. He is also on the 
board of trustees of the International Life Sciences Institute, an 
industry-funded organization that is notorious for pushing out shoddy 
nutrition science.
  Dr. Barbara Beck is a consultant with Gradient, which has itself 
earned a reputation for helping industry defend their products with 
favorable scientific studies. Beck herself helped to write a paper 
arguing that exposure to lead at low doses is not necessarily harmful 
to children, which is in stark contrast to the CDC's assessment that 
there is no safe level of exposure to lead.
  The common thread among these individuals is that they are 
practitioners of the widely used disinformation playbook. They 
frequently work to inject uncertainty into science by criticizing risk 
assessments and underlying models. They argue that exposure to 
pollutants at low doses is not worth worrying about. That is not true. 
Pollution is pollution, and it is bad for communities, and it is bad 
for public health.
  I also want to spend some time discussing the administration's new 
clean water rule. For more than 45 years, the Clean Water Act has 
preserved, protected, and restored our Nation's most important natural 
resource and radically transformed how our Nation uses water. That is 
why admirers of CWA appropriately labeled this law as one of the most 
successful public health initiatives ever enacted. Continued success of 
the CWA requires developing a clear, concise rule for determining which 
bodies of water are protected by the Clean Water Act. However, Mr. 
Wheeler and the Trump administration have proposed a rule that fails to 
provide the clear-cut certainty requested by my constituents. It would 
cancel protections for drinking water sources of tens of millions of 
people. It would also cancel protections for streams and wetlands that 
provide habitat for wildlife and protect communities from flooding.
  Communities across the country, particularly low-income communities 
and communities of color, already struggle to access clean water. Mr. 
Wheeler's proposed rule will make it even harder for these communities. 
Mr. Wheeler's water rule puts the profits of corporate polluters before 
our health and clean water for our families.
  Alan, from Wheeling, IL, wrote to me and said:

       This is insanity. There is nothing more important than 
     protecting the sources of water that many people in this 
     country drink from.
       No source of drinking water should be open for pollution or 
     destruction, but that is exactly what this proposal does by 
     stripping protections from critical streams and wetlands 
     across the country.
       Senator Duckworth, please do anything that is possible to 
     protect our environment and industries that depend upon clean 
     water.

  Alan, thank you for writing to me. I agree with you. This rule makes 
no scientific, legal, public health, or fiscal sense.
  Another constituent, Dave from Rockford, shared with me similar 
concerns. He wrote:

       Clean water is not a political issue. Protecting our 
     watersheds and ensuring that clean, fresh water is available 
     for fish, farms and communities is not an option--it's a 
     responsibility.
       I cannot think of a more enjoyable satisfaction [than] just 
     standing in a clean river, seeing all the life teaming in it, 
     and knowing that our hard work is paying off.

  Dave is right. Streams and wetlands work as natural filters and 
sponges, keeping our drinking water supplies safe, while reducing the 
impact of floods.
  Like our water, I am concerned by this administration's attacks on 
clean air. One group that comes to mind that has been fighting for our 
clean air is Mom's Clean Air Task Force. They are a group of moms who 
know how painful it is when their child can't play outside because they 
have asthma or there is smog outside. They are fighting for cleaner air 
and stronger kids.
  They list ten reasons they oppose Mr. Wheeler, and among those 
reasons are his attacks on rules to control mercury pollution, to make 
our cars more fuel efficient, and to reduce smog.
  Mr. Wheeler's attacks on these priorities hits close to home for me. 
Currently, the rate of asthma in Illinois is 13 percent higher than the 
national average. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranks 
Chicago in the top 10 percent of the most challenging places to live 
with asthma. Asthma is hitting the frontline neighborhoods in Chicago 
harder than in many other


places in the Nation, with asthma rates in some neighborhoods soaring 
as high as 33 percent. As the climate gets hotter, air pollution, 
allergies, and temperatures will trigger more asthma attacks in 
children.
  I want to end on a high note. I commend Mr. Wheeler for following 
through on his promise to make himself accessible and to conduct 
proactive outreach. Compared to Mr. Pruitt, he is an upgrade in terms 
of professionalism, but that is an incredibly low bar.
  At the end of the day, my constituents are depending on me to protect 
them from pollution, even if it upsets some in industry. I believe we 
need an Administrator who is ready to fight for our kids, to fight for 
the Great Lakes, to fight for the civil servants that work at EPA, and 
to fight for every American's right to clean air, clean water, and a 
healthy environment. I believe EPA will achieve its mission when it 
requires rigorous enforcement when human health is at stake.
  Mr. Wheeler believes that public health must be balanced against the 
health of corporations and industry interests who always want less 
rules, less oversight, and certainly less enforcement. That is why I 
must vote no.
  I yield the floor.

1056,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1519-3,12,Mr. WYDEN,"  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this week the Senate is debating the 
nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency.
  I am going to make this short because this is bad news for anybody 
who wants the Environmental Protection Agency to live up to its 
fundamental mission; that is, to protect the public health so our 
citizens, from sea to shining sea, can breathe clean air and drink 
clean water.
  In my view, Andrew Wheeler is Scott Pruitt without an appetite for 
luxury travel on the taxpayers' dime--yet another Trump appointee doing 
the bidding of the dirtiest, most powerful industry in America, no 
matter what physical harm it might do to the people of our country.
  To me, the fundamental obligation of an EPA Administrator should be 
to make sure we don't compromise our health and the environment. 
Regrettably, Mr. Wheeler has spent his career doing essentially the 
opposite.
  Given what he has done during his time as acting head of the Agency, 
he has already proven what sort of backward-thinking Administrator he 
will be. In fact, I think it would be fair to say Andrew Wheeler is 
sure to be ``Administrator Rollback.''
  During his time as Acting-Administrator, he's rolled back fuel 
economy standards that reduce pollution and help drivers save money at 
the pump. Not even the car companies support him on that. He is rolling 
back the rules designed to stop dirty powerplants from belching toxic 
gases into the air. He is rolling back rules designed to protect 
workers from exposure on the job to dangerous chemicals that can cause 
heart attacks, for example. He is rolling back EPA enforcement--basic 
enforcement--of a host of safeguards that are already on the books.
  Civil penalties against polluters are now at their lowest since 1994. 
Inspections of potentially toxic industrial sites amount to half of 
what they were just in 2010. Civil fines have plummeted on his watch. 
Judicial enforcement cases that have begun and are concluded have been 
cut in half. The Wheeler EPA is already letting environmental criminals 
off the hook. It is my view that these criminals are not creating 
victimless crimes--what they are doing is poisoning our communities, 
our workplaces, our air, and our water.
  Perhaps what is most alarming about his appointment is that he 
essentially waves a hand of dismissal to the existential threat of 
climate change.
  I have a lot of open-to-everybody townhall meetings in my State. We 
have now had more than 920. Just last week, I held five in different 
parts of our State. In counties where Donald Trump won and in counties 
where Hillary Clinton won, the issue of climate change comes up 
everywhere.
  At the root of the questions I get in communities that span the 
philosophical spectrum is that people are terrified--terrified--of what 
climate change is going to bring. They see the news coming out of 
Washington. They see that the Trump administration isn't just waving 
the white flag of surrender on climate change. In effect, it almost 
feels as if the Trump people want to bring on those climate changes 
even faster. Anybody who is walking around in our communities and sees 
temperature shifts of more than 30 or 40 degrees on a dime is 
completely aware of what I am talking about, even if the Trump 
administration is not.
  In my home State, when you talk about climate change, the first thing 
Oregonians think about are wildfires. These fires are not your 
grandfather's fires. They are bigger. They are hotter. They are more 
powerful.
  Not too long ago, we actually had a fire leap the Columbia River--our 
magnificent Columbia River. This is noteworthy for a variety reasons 
but especially because our rivers historically have acted as fire 
bricks. Now we have these bigger and more powerful fires almost all 
year round, not just a few months in the summer, the way it used to be. 
These new megafires are extraordinary.
  It is almost as if we are trying to get acclimated to the idea of 
clean air refugees--people who live near areas where fires break out, 
with ash built up on their cars like snow in the wintertime.
  California has seen its own huge infernos causing horrible fatalities 
in the last few years. Nevada has seen it, Colorado and Washington as 
well. People are literally homeless, out and about in their 
communities, trying to just find a safe place for shelter.
  Climate change is also not just about fires. Across the West, there 
is the threat of crippling drought. The hurricanes that battled the 
East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico are intensifying and drowning our 
cities with rain. It seems like every day there is another report about 
how sea levels are rising faster than previously estimated.
  Climate change is affecting wildlife in catastrophic ways. Entire 
ecosystems could be lost. This week, there were reports that an ice 
sheet larger than the island of Manhattan broke off from Antarctica. So 
the effects of climate change aren't some threat way off in the future. 
It is already a massive problem today. Americans feel it, and they see 
it in their communities again and again.
  My wife and I are older parents. We have 11-year-old twins and a 6-
year-old daughter. I--and I am sure there are plenty of other 
Senators--think about what their generation is going to be dealing with 
down the road. This is why there is so much grassroots energy out there 
about the Green New Deal, which I am proud to cosponsor.
  I can tell you from the conversations I had in Oregon, people know 
what a grave threat climate change poses. They want action. My hope is 
that there are a variety of ways, like we saw with the original New 
Deal, in which we can find some common ground.
  I am the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which 
writes the tax laws. We have more than 40 separate tax breaks for 
energy that are on the books today, and most of them are dirty energy 
tax relics of yesteryear.
  What I have proposed is that we basically throw those 40 energy tax 
breaks--relics of dirty energy--in the trash can and substitute three; 
one for clean energy, one for clean transportation fuel, and one for 
energy efficiency.
  The Presiding Officer is new here. She is getting out and talking to 
Senators about a variety issues. I can tell her that what I will be 
saying to colleagues on the other side of the aisle is something like, 
my idea responds to what Republicans have been talking about, the need 
for fewer subsidies. We ought to have fewer subsidies for energy.
  Why don't we try to work together, find common ground, and do it 
particularly on an issue that helps us to promote clean energy at a 
time of dramatic climate change?


  That is why I believe Andrew Wheeler is the wrong person to lead the 
EPA. Just when we need Democrats and Republicans to come together to 
find fresh ideas to combat climate change, he basically says that it 
really isn't a threat at all.
  It really isn't a threat to Mr. Wheeler, and he is making the climate 
change challenge worse by basically suppressing the authority and the 
ability of the Agency to take this existential challenge head-on.
  The mission of the EPA is all about protecting human health, fighting 
for clean air, fighting for clean water, and fighting on behalf of 
Americans from sea to shining sea.
  Andrew Wheeler fights for those who endanger our health and pollute 
our air and water. This isn't a tough call. I am a no on a nomination 
that represents danger and going backward. I urge my colleagues to stay 
with me.

  Father Phil is a native of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and now lives in 
North Smithfield, Rhode Island, a community that I am proud to 
represent today in Congress.
  He served our country in uniform during the Vietnam war as a combat 
infantryman and earned the Silver Star for his valor.
  After his service to our country, Father Phil felt called to service 
in another capacity. He was ordained into the priesthood on June 10, 
1984.
  A few years later, Father Phil joined the Veterans Administration in 
Boston, where he served as chief of the chaplain service from 1993 to 
2005.
  Today, he continues to minister to veterans in Rhode Island and all 
across America. We owe all of our servicemembers and their families an 
incredible debt of gratitude.
  The men and women of the United States Armed Forces represent our 
country's most important values of service, honor, courage, and 
sacrifice. This is especially true of Father Phil, who represents the 
very best of our country and my home State of Rhode Island.

  By traveling to Washington to share their stories and discuss 
opportunities for governmental and societal change, these young adults 
have demonstrated deep commitment to the community of those who have 
learning disabilities.

Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 8) to require a background check for every firearm sale, with Mr. 
Blumenauer in the chair.",,2019-02-27

  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that today we are considering H.R. 8, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. We have promised the American 
people that Congress would take steps to reduce gun violence, and this 
bill is a critical first step toward doing so.
  During the past 4 weeks, as the Judiciary Committee, and now the full 
House, have discussed the issue of gun violence, I have cited grim 
statistics. Nearly 40,000 Americans lost their lives because of guns in 
2017. In fact, every day in America, on average, 34 people are murdered 
with a firearm, and more than 183 people are injured in an attack.
  Gun violence of this magnitude is a distinctly American problem. A 
country-to-country comparison is shocking. For example, in 2011, the 
United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; 
Portugal, 142; and Japan, just 30. The United States, that year, about 
35,000.
  A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, 
compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate 
in the United States is 25 times higher. Even when you adjust for 
population differences, Americans are disproportionately killed by gun 
violence.
  Almost 25 years to the day after the Brady Act was first implemented, 
expanding our current background check requirement to cover virtually 
all gun transfers is one of the steps we must take to address this 
crisis.
  Under current law, only licensed firearms dealers are required to 
conduct a background check before transferring a gun to another person. 
This means that gun shows, online sales, and other private sales can 
completely evade this vital tool for ensuring that guns do not get into 
the wrong hands. It is time to close this dangerous loophole.
  This bill would make it illegal for any person who is not a licensed 
firearm importer, manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any 
other person who is not so licensed without a background check. 
Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be 
required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary 
background check before the transfer could be finalized.
  The bill also provides a number of exceptions to this requirement, 
including gifts to family members and transfers for hunting, target 
shooting, and instances of imminent death or great bodily harm.
  The FBI's internal assessment demonstrated that checks processed 
through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, often 
called NICS, are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, 
and in 90 percent of cases, the background checks are completed within 
90 seconds. H.R. 8 will provide an accurate and speedy mechanism to 
help ensure firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.
  There is no reason to continue to make it easy for people who are 
legally prohibited from possessing firearms to acquire them by 
circumventing the background check process. H.R. 8 would close this 
dangerous loophole and save many, many lives. That is why I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this vital legislation today.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.",N000002,2019-02-27
1079,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,5,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia,"  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Today I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8, the so-called Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act of 2019. This is bad legislation that fails to 
make anyone safer in any regard.
  I have been listening here, sitting on the floor for just the last 
few minutes and listening to those who came up and were happy about 
this bill coming forward today, and they mentioned many acts of mass 
violence and situations that have happened. The sad part about it is 
they claim this is the answer and the first step. In actuality, it is, 
at best, a side step, and it may actually be a step backwards and will 
not do what it is being claimed to do.
  All this legislation will do is burden law-abiding citizens wishing 
to exercise their Second Amendment rights, including defending 
themselves from the gun-toting criminals this bill does nothing to 
combat.


  H.R. 8 foolishly presumes criminals who flout existing laws will 
suddenly submit themselves to background checks.
  Are Members who support this bill delusional enough to think a 
criminal trading cocaine to another criminal for a firearm will give 
consideration to H.R. 8 and go to the nearest gun store to submit to a 
background check? That is absurd.
  Most of us will agree that criminals are not going to do that anyway. 
My concern is what it actually does in practice to those who are not 
criminals.
  Not only is it foolish to think they will start following the law, it 
is also foolish to think it is going to in any way make our country 
safer.
  My Democratic friends have exploited every mass shooting, calling for 
universal background checks, but H.R. 8 would not have stopped a single 
mass shooting.
  These strategies do, however, share one thing in common. Over and 
over, we see issues of mental health and missed opportunities for 
authorities to intercede.
  Let me just say, Mr. Chair, I share the concern. I am going to share, 
in just a moment, actual, real things that actually could make a 
difference in helping to stem the tide of mass violence in our country. 
But doing this, we have to understand that this bill does not do that, 
and what may make you feel good may not heal you. That has to be 
understood.
  Look at the recent workplace shooting in Illinois, where the gunman 
murdered five people. That could have been prevented, but not by H.R. 
8. All law enforcement had to do was enforce existing law. The gunman 
was prohibited from possessing firearms.
  In January 2014, he was issued an Illinois firearm owner's 
identification card. That March, he applied to buy a handgun from a gun 
dealer. Five days later, he took possession of the gun, having 
inexplicably passed a background check. That month, he applied for a 
concealed carry permit. During a background check for the permit, his 
felony conviction was flagged.
  Illinois police revoked his firearm card and sent him a letter 
telling him to relinquish the firearm. Not surprisingly, the felon did 
not comply. Had authorities seized the firearm between March 2014 and 
February 2019, they could have saved five lives.
  Aurora, Illinois, is not the only missed opportunity to prevent 
tragedy. We know about missed opportunities in Parkland; Aurora, 
Colorado; Sutherland Springs; Virginia Tech; and others.
  The common problem here, Mr. Chair, is clear. It is not a lack of 
background checks.
  With H.R. 8, Democrats refuse to acknowledge the human factors 
leading to these events, but Republicans have a bill to help law 
enforcement coordinate responses to mental health concerns and other 
mass violent threat information.


  You know what else H.R. 8 doesn't address? The primary ways criminals 
acquire firearms. Last month, DOJ revealed nearly half of criminals 
obtained firearms via theft or the black market. The survey also 
revealed that a mere 0.8 percent of criminals purchased their firearms 
at gun shows.
  If this bill won't prevent mass shootings and address violent crime, 
what will it do? It will keep law-abiding citizens from protecting 
themselves. Under this bill, Mr. Chair, a battered woman with a 
protection order against her abuser who borrows a firearm for self-
defense would be a criminal. It would criminalize the selling of a 
firearm without a background check to someone with a valid permit 
allowing them to possess, acquire, or carry a firearm. If that person 
walked into a gun store, they could present that permit and not undergo 
a NICS check.
  On the other hand, there are solutions to prevent mass violence and 
gun crime. The Mass Violence Prevention Act, which I introduced earlier 
this week, is one. The MVP Act directly addresses challenges in law 
enforcement coordination and response. It would reduce the flow of 
firearms into the black market, and it would bolster law enforcement's 
ability to prosecute criminals for firearm offenses.
  If reducing gun violence, Mr. Chair, is the Democrats' concern, the 
MVP Act is legislation that we should be considering today, not H.R. 8. 
Talk to me or my staff about cosponsoring this evidence-based, 
commonsense legislation. Unlike H.R. 8, the MVP Act could have 
prevented tragedies such as Parkland.
  Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, my Democratic colleagues, by putting this 
forward and continuing the same narrative, are not actually interested 
in stopping gun violence. I take the intent to be good; I do not 
question the motive. All of us in our life do not want to see the 
tragedies unfold. But this is not the way forward.
  This is another thing put out to the very ones who have suffered, 
telling them we are helping them, while at the same time not telling 
them the truth about the bill, a bill that guts its own ability to 
enforce itself, a bill that actually, possibly, would keep people from 
purchasing firearms because of an unlimited price of a background 
check.
  The question that I have about this bill, Mr. Chair, is not what 
actually could happen with this. It is what actually will be hurt by 
this as we move forward.
  With that, I believe that we are being misled. The victims of mass 
violence are being misled by this bill, H.R. 8, because it would not 
stop what they have been promised that it would stop.
  Mr. Chair, for that, I am profoundly sorry. But because of that, I 
call on my colleagues to reject H.R. 8 and to support real solutions.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-27

Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which will extend the current 
Federal background check requirement to unlicensed sellers of guns.
  It is about time that Congress takes this issue seriously, and I am 
pleased that this bipartisan bill has been brought to the House floor 
with the urgency this issue deserves.
  In recent years, our Nation has experienced an increase in mass 
shootings, and our Nation is appropriately horrified. However, mass 
shootings are just one symptom of our gun violence epidemic. The daily 
toll of shootings occurs in communities across our country, on our 
streets, in our schools, and even in our houses of worship.
  As Aalayah Eastmond testified before the Judiciary Committee earlier 
this month, 1 year after the terrible shooting that took the lives of 
17 students and staff and injured 17 others at her high school in 
Parkland, Florida: ``Minority communities bear the heaviest burden of 
gun violence in this country.''
  The impact on our young people is simply unacceptable. Every day, 47 
children and teens are shot in this country. Eight of these young 
people die, and 39 are shot and survive.
  Citizens across this country such as Diane Latiker, who also 
testified before the committee, are taking it upon themselves to 
organize and engage in community-based efforts to reduce gun violence 
and to assist the young people it affects. We in Congress must match 
their courage and commitment with action of our own.
  I support H.R. 8 because it will reduce gun violence by narrowing the 
avenues for criminals and other prohibited persons from obtaining guns.
  Certainly, there is no single change to our gun laws that will 
prevent every shooting, but enacting measures that will help prevent 
some of them is clearly the right thing to do.
  Mr. Chair, that is why I support this bill, and I ask my colleagues 
to do the same.",B001270,2019-02-27

narrow--in fact, it continues the process of those who are going to 
receive guns. Much of the daily toll that we see is actually coming 
from those who are already violating laws currently on the books. It is 
time we actually enforce those as well.

McClintock).",C001093,2019-02-27

  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is brought to us by the same groups and 
politicians who have made no secret of their desire to ultimately strip 
law-abiding citizens of their right to defend themselves. Now, they 
can't do that outright; they know that. So they do it through cynical 
measures like this, which weave a web of laws so intricate, that, 
sooner or later, everyone can be caught up in them.
  This law affects not just transfer of ownership, but any transfer of 
weapon for any period of time. Suppose you exchange shotguns with a 
friend on a hunt and then separate for a period of time, or you loan a 
gun to your next-door neighbor of 20 years who is being victimized by a 
stalker, or you give a gun to your stepson or your great-grandson. 
Under any of these innocent scenarios and countless more like them, you 
are guilty of a Federal crime.
  These flaws were all pointed out to the bill's sponsors, and none 
were addressed. Why not? I think the reason should be obvious.
  Last October, a 10-year study by Johns Hopkins and UC Davis concluded 
that California's universal background check law had no effect on gun 
homicides or suicides--none.
  The purpose of this bill is not public safety. That is just a 
deceptive facade. Its true purpose is to make gun ownership so legally 
hazardous, so fraught with legal booby traps and draconian penalties, 
that no honest and law-abiding citizen would want to take the risk of 
gun ownership.
  Most criminals already get their guns illegally and are unconstrained 
by laws like this. Make no mistake, this is aimed squarely at law-
abiding citizens, moving us closer to a society where decent people are 
defenseless and armed criminals are kings.",M001177,2019-02-27

country. For 8 years, we have marked it with moments of silence and 
doing nothing, saying nothing and doing nothing. But today, that 
changes with passage of H.R. 8 for universal background checks.
  We know universal background checks work, because since the passage 
of the Brady bill, 3.5 million illegal gun sales were prevented. But, 
of course, there is a huge loophole. Millions and millions of gun sales 
happen without a background check at all. In fact, one in five, 22 
percent, of guns are sold with no background check. That means 
criminals, domestic abusers, and people prohibited due to mental 
illness can get a gun. This bill changes that.
  We also know that States that have enhanced background checks have 
lower rates of gun homicides, gun suicide rates, and gun trafficking.
  This is a commonsense bill to protect the American people from the 
scourge of gun violence.
  Finally, after 8 years of pleading with our Republican colleagues to 
do something about gun violence in this country, to take up a bill--we 
had a sit-in to try to force a vote--finally,


today, we are taking our first step to reduce gun violence in this 
country by passing H.R. 8.
  Finally, we will see Members of Congress standing up to the power of 
the gun lobby and doing what is right for the American people.

  Mr. Chairman, I tell you that H.R. 8 will do little more than further 
burden law-abiding gun owners. Without an unconstitutional Federal gun 
registry, this bill is impossible to enforce.
  There is no gun show loophole. Federal law is the same regardless of 
where a firearm sale takes place. Federal law requires all firearms 
dealers to be licensed and to initiate a background check before 
transferring a firearm to a nondealer, regardless of where that 
transfer takes place.
  As for nondealers, Federal law prohibits transferring a firearm to 
anyone known or believed to be prohibited from possessing firearms. 
That is already the law.
  According to DOJ, less than 1 percent of criminals in State prison 
for firearm crimes get their firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun 
shows. According to ATF, 6 percent of Federal armed career criminals 
got their firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun shows.
  Online sales loophole: There is no online sales loophole. The Federal 
law is the same regardless of how people communicate about selling or 
buying a firearm.
  Federal law prohibits anyone, licensed firearm dealer or not, from 
shipping a firearm to a person who lives in another State unless the 
receiver is also a dealer. Dealers must document all firearms they 
receive.
  H.R. 8 also fails to include many of the realistic exceptions to the 
new background check requirements for private transfers, such as 
transfers between law enforcement officers outside of their duties, 
transfers to concealed carry permit holders, transfers to museums or 
licensed collectors, transfers to Active Duty military, and many more.
  H.R. 8 includes an exception to the background check transfer if the 
transfer is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. 
But that transfer is only allowed for the length of time that it is 
necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. It doesn't 
even define those terms.
  What about a false alarm? Does it extend to domestic violence fears 
if the person is not getting attacked immediately? Gun rights groups 
have argued that without a definition, this provision would only 
provide protection in instances where it is likely too late for the 
victim to make it out safely.
  Finally, H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the recent high-
profile shootings. In those cases, the shooter either passed a Federal 
background check or stole the firearms they used.",B001302,2019-02-27

yielding.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 8, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.
  Mr. Chair, first, I thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Nadler for 
their support. Gun violence is a true national emergency, and I am glad 
that we are moving so early in this Congress to address this crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who recognize the importance of passing this legislation, 
Representatives King, Fitzpatrick, Mast, Upton, and Smith, who stand 
with more than 90 percent of Americans who support universal background 
checks.


  This bill will require a background check on all firearm sales and 
most transfers. Mr. Chairman, I am a lifelong gun owner. I am a hunter 
and I support the Second Amendment. If this bill did anything to erode 
the rights of lawful gun owners, I wouldn't support it and it wouldn't 
have my name on it.
  Background checks work. Every day, they stop 170 felons and 50 
domestic abusers from getting a gun from a licensed dealer. But, in 
some States, those same people can go into a gun show or go online and 
buy a gun without a background check. This bill will help stop them 
from doing so.
  Some will argue that criminals won't follow the law. If that is the 
case, then why do we have laws against murder? People still commit 
murder. Why do we have laws against stealing? People still steal. This 
is flawed logic, and don't fall for it.
  This bill is supported by law enforcement, medical professionals, 
veterans, gun owners, religious leaders, and the millions of Americans 
who took to the streets in support of H.R. 8.

yielding to me.
  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 8, a bill that criminalizes gun 
transfers between law-abiding citizens who have no criminal record and 
no criminal intent.
  The bill includes several flawed and unworkable exceptions. Take the 
law enforcement exception. It allows the police to transfer a firearm, 
but criminalizes transfers to law enforcement.
  Under this bill, a parent whose child finds a gun in a park commits a 
Federal crime if the parent surrenders the gun to police.
  Under this bill, a citizen commits a Federal crime if they 
participate in a local gun buy-back program.
  Under this bill, an attorney commits a Federal crime when they turn a 
client's gun over to the police to clear the client through ballistics 
testing.
  Will criminalizing cooperation with law enforcement make us safer? 
The majority apparently thinks so, and I think it is crazy.
  The Democrats' bill gives special privileges to the bodyguards of the 
wealthy elite, like former Mayor Bloomberg, who is funding the special 
interest advocacy for this bill. He can afford to hire bodyguards. But 
average Americans, who rely on the Second Amendment as their source of 
personal protection, are not given similar protections.
  Nothing should be more offensive to this body than a bill that denies 
citizens their endowed rights while giving wealthy elites special 
protections, privileges, and dispensations. But that is H.R. 8.
  Take the family exception; the rule allows a vote on an amendment to 
ensure that transfers between parent and child include stepparents and 
stepchildren. What about transfers between a foster parent and foster 
child? This bill says foster relationships are not worthy of the same 
respect and equal treatment. Every Member of this body should be 
ashamed to vote for this bill that reflects such terrible policy and 
discrimination.
  Take the Good Samaritan exception, allowing transfers where a threat 
of death or harm is imminent. Imminent means death is menacingly near, 
a standard so strict that it is, frankly, too late to transfer a gun 
once it is obvious a gun is needed for protection.
  Under this standard, it is illegal to loan a gun to a victim of 
domestic violence for her protection until the transferor is 
practically witnessing a murder in progress.
  This standard would also prevent a gun owner who has intermittent 
suicidal thoughts, a known side-effect of certain prescription 
medications, from legally transferring a gun--his own gun--to a friend 
for safekeeping.
  Because this bill criminalizes transfers between law-abiding 
Americans, while doing nothing to curb criminals' access to guns, this 
bill provides the American public with a false sense of security.
  Because this bill includes unworkable exceptions that will mislead 
people


into thinking a gun transfer is legal when it is not, this bill 
provides law-abiding gun owners with a false sense of immunity.

  Mr. Chairman, today marks a very pivotal moment in our fight to 
prevent gun violence and to ensure the safety of every community across 
our Nation.
  I thank the more than 230 of my colleagues who have cosponsored H.R. 
8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. I thank Chairman 
Nadler, Speaker Pelosi, Congressman Thompson, and Congressman King for 
making gun violence prevention a priority in this Congress. I am so 
proud to be an original cosponsor of this historic legislation.
  As many of you may know, gun violence is an issue that is deeply 
personal for me. Gun violence prevention and a desire to make 
meaningful change is the very reason I am here today, in this 
legislative body, speaking to every one of you.
  In 2012, my son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed by a man who 
opened fire on a car of unarmed teenagers at a gas station in 
Jacksonville, Florida. My son was only 17 years of age. Jordan would 
have turned 24 this month.
  After my son's death, I dedicated my entire life to advocating for 
commonsense gun safety solutions, but it was the shooting at Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last year, that 
finally motivated me to join this legislative body.

  The overwhelming bipartisan support for universal background checks 
symbolizes the power of advocacy and the incredible power of the 
survivors, family members, and students who have shared their stories 
as they advocate for commonsense gun safety solutions and demand that 
we act to address gun violence.
  Today, we are truly taking this action. H.R. 8 will ensure that 
mothers and fathers have one less reason to worry. It will give 
students one less thing to fear when they walk into a school. Most 
importantly, it will make our communities and our Nation a safer place 
to live, and every human being in America deserves such.

  Mr. Chairman, this legislation claims to be a solution to gun 
violence, yet does nothing to actually solve the real problems that 
contribute to this crisis. As it stands now, this legislation does 
nothing to make our schools, churches, or communities safer. In fact, 
it only infringes on the constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment 
rights of law-abiding American citizens, something I cannot support.
  This bill will criminalize the private transfer of firearms and will 
make exercising basic constitutional rights impossibly expensive for 
millions of law-abiding Americans. Not to mention, it is essentially 
unenforceable without a national gun registry. But, let's be honest, 
that is where my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to end 
up: registering firearms so they can systematically take them away. We 
must stop our Nation from falling down this slippery slope.
  I think we can all agree that something needs to be done to stop the 
illegal ownership and misuse of firearms, but H.R. 8 is not the answer. 
This legislation would have done nothing to prevent many of the 
prominent tragedies that occurred in my home State of Florida.
  The shooter at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland 
passed a background check. The shooter at the Pulse nightclub in 
Orlando passed a background check. And, just weeks ago, a man who 
murdered five women in my district passed a background check.
  H.R. 8 would have done nothing to stop these violent acts, just like 
the previous attempts to require universal background checks have done 
nothing to prevent actual crimes.
  If Democrats are serious about gun violence, they would have voted 
for my amendment. I filed an amendment in committee that would have 
required law enforcement to be notified upon the attempt of someone to 
purchase a firearm and failed a background check. Law enforcement would 
have been notified. But instead of supporting policies that curtail 
legal possession of firearms, the Democrats on both the Judiciary 
Committee and the Rules Committee rejected my proposal. How is that 
unreasonable?
  Mr. Chairman, I stand for the Constitution. I stand for freedom. And 
I stand for the Second Amendment. That is why I am not voting for this 
proposal.",S001214,2019-02-27

       Nothing in this act . . . shall be construed to authorize 
     the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a national 
     firearms registry.

  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.",N000002,2019-02-27
1097,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,23,Ms. PELOSI,"  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I 
thank him for his leadership as chair of the Judiciary Committee, for 
bringing us to this place promptly. It is an historic day in the 
Congress of the United States.
  Mr. Chairman, I thank our distinguished colleague from California, 
Mr.   Mike Thompson, for his relentless, persistent leadership to make 
America safer by bringing forth commonsense background check 
legislation. He is a gun owner and a veteran. He has been on both sides 
of the gun. He is a hunter. He is an advocate for the Second Amendment. 
And, as he said, if this had anything to diminish that, he would not 
have his name on it.
  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this strong, bipartisan bill and 
join Mr. Thompson in commending Mr. King of New York for making this 
initiative bipartisan from the start, in the previous Congress and now. 
It is a long, overdue commonsense action to end the epidemic of gun 
violence in America.
  Let us salute, again, the persistent leadership of so many in this 
body. And, again, Mr. Thompson, as chair of the Gun Violence Prevention 
Task Force; he has worked in a bipartisan way to protect our 
communities, and we are grateful to him for that.
  We can do all the inside maneuvering that we want, and that is really 
important and essential, but, without the outside mobilization, we 
cannot enjoy the success of saving lives and making progress. So I want 
to thank the courageous advocates who are here today, in the gallery, 
including March for Our Lives and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in 
America, and so many more. They have made a complete difference.
  As President Lincoln said: ``Public sentiment is everything. With it 
you can accomplish almost anything, without it almost nothing.''
  I thank them for building public sentiment to a point where now about 
90 percent of the American people support commonsense background check 
legislation, including many members, courageously, of the National 
Rifle Association.
  This bill is proudly bipartisan because gun violence prevention 
should not be a Democratic or Republican issue. Gun violence does not 
discriminate by party or politics. It reaches into all of our 
communities, our schools, our places of worship, our workplaces, and 
our streets, and it will require all of our courage to defeat it.

  Last night, we were at an occasion to mark the 25th anniversary of 
the Brady Bill. Some of us were in Congress at that time. Many of us 
here, then or not, admire the courageous work of Sarah and Jim Brady to 
make the country a safer place by reducing gun violence.
  Twenty-five years ago, we enacted the Brady background check system, 
which has denied more than 3 million sales to potentially dangerous 
individuals. Yet, the Brady Bill does not stop people from purchasing 
guns from unlicensed sellers without a background check at gun shows 
and online.
  We must pass H.R. 8 to close this dangerous loophole and keep our 
communities safe from gun violence. That is what we are intending to do 
today.


  George Bernard Shaw said that: ``It is the mark of a truly 
intelligent person to be moved by statistics,'' and here are the facts:
  Nearly 40,000 lives are cut short every year from gun violence.
  An average of 47 children and teenagers are killed by guns every 
single day. As I said, it is all about the children, the children, the 
children.
  We read about the tragic mass murders that have happened in our 
country, and they stir us to action, hopefully. Here it has been they 
stir us to a moment of silence, and now, finally, to action.


  But it is every day. Every day 47 children and teenagers killed by 
guns.
  And, again, another figure, hearkening back to 90 percent of the 
American people want commonsense universal background checks.
  The statistics spell out the stories, but it is the human personal 
stories that change minds.
  How moving it was to hear our colleague, Congresswoman McBath, with 
her generosity of spirit tell her personal story of losing her son, 
Jordan--I can't even imagine carrying that burden--but turning her 
grief and her tragedy into action and courage to run for Congress, to 
stand on this floor and share her personal story with us. That takes 
real courage.
  Let's hope that we all have the courage to save children's lives, 
everyone's lives in our country whose deaths can be avoided.
  There is no person in this body whose political survival is more 
important than the survival of our children.
  We are grateful, again, to the young people, parents, survivors 
across America who have told their stories, marched for their lives, 
and demanded change. This bill delivers that change, ensuring that 
people who are a danger to themselves and others cannot purchase a gun 
and perpetuate violence in our communities.
  This week, the House will build on this progress by passing another 
bipartisan background check bill. We must close the Charleston loophole 
that enabled the horrific hate crime at Emanuel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church.
  We salute the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, for his leadership on H.R. 
1112.
  Tomorrow, we will vote on that. That is another part of strengthening 
the background check provisions.
  As Members of Congress, again, we take an oath to protect and defend 
the Constitution, the American people. To honor that oath, to honor the 
victims of gun violence and their families, Congress must take real 
action on this floor. Today, we must pass this bill and take the first 
steps toward ending the senseless crisis of gun violence in our Nation.
  Again, I hope that all of us will have the courage to save lives, 
remembering that no one's political survival here is more important 
than the survival of the American people--especially our children.
  I urge a strong bipartisan ``yes'' vote and pray that we can do the 
right thing and send a clear message to the families of those who have 
lost their loved ones to gun violence, that we have crossed a threshold 
here today to reduce gun violence in our country and take more steps to 
improve the safety of the American people, honoring the Constitution of 
the United States, respectful of our hunters and the need for people to 
defend themselves, but doing so in a way that does not endanger others.",P000197,2019-02-27

important, and I believe the strength to tell that. I believe the 
chairman just redid that. He exactly explained why this bill will not 
operate because of the very fact that, inside the bill itself, it does 
not have a registry, which I will remind the Chair that the Department 
of Justice under President Obama said a universal background check bill 
will not work without a registry and is on the websites of many 
advocates for this bill. That is just one of the areas that we look at 
as we go forward in realizing that this has already gutted itself when 
we look at the bill.

Cline).",C001093,2019-02-27
1100,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,26,Mr. CLINE,"  Mr. CLINE. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the previous speaker, the 
Speaker of the House, reminding us all that it is California where 
Michael Bloomberg and the gun control advocates have established their 
utopia of a land without guns. And what has it led us to? With some of 
the strictest gun control laws in the land, we have some of the worst 
incidents of gun violence in the country.
  Gun control measures do not address the problems of gun violence, and 
this bill will not address gun violence.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8. The legislation is 
an attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights, hidden under the 
guise that we will see a reduction in violent crime.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim the bill would 
save lives, but nothing in this bill would have stopped any of the 
recent mass casualty shootings that have occurred in our country. The 
only thing this bill does is limit the Second Amendment rights of law-
abiding citizens.
  They will tell you this bill closes loopholes; however, the loophole 
that they believe exists is private gun ownership, and what they really 
want is to regulate the private transfer of firearms. If my neighbor is 
in trouble and needs to borrow a firearm to protect his family, I 
should be allowed to loan that firearm to my neighbor so that he can 
protect himself and his family.
  This is not something we should need to go to the Federal Government 
to get permission to do. The Second Amendment does not say that, after 
you get permission from the government, your right to keep and bear 
arms shall not be infringed.
  Our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution to protect us from the 
government and gave individuals the Second Amendment to protect 
themselves.
  I carry this Constitution every day on the campaign trail asphalt. I 
carry it with me every day now to remind myself of those protections 
that were given to us--not by government, but by God.
  This bill is nothing more than an attempt to advance the agenda of 
radical gun-grabbers and lay the foundation for a national gun 
registration scheme. Mr. Chair, I urge the House to reject this 
misguided legislation so we can begin having real discussions about 
ways to reduce crime across this great Nation.",C001118,2019-02-27

and I rise today to express my strong support for this bill, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act.
  Since the Brady law was enacted in 1994, many American lives have 
been saved, murders have fallen by at least 32 percent, and our 
community streets are safer and stronger as a result. But our work is 
not done. In Houston alone, we see an average of 550 acts of gun 
violence per year.
  Too many of our loved ones are lost to senseless gun violence that 
could be prevented by keeping firearms out of dangerous hands. We know 
expanded background checks work.
  States requiring background checks on all handgun sales see half as 
many mass shootings as States without the expanded requirements. That 
is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8. This commonsense bill will 
prevent private firearm sales to prohibit purchasers and close online 
and gun show loopholes.
  While this bill does not cover everything, it is a step in the right 
direction that will make my district--Houston, Texas--and this country 
safer.",G000587,2019-02-27

enforcement officer for 23 years in the great State of Minnesota, the 
city of Duluth.
  In December of 1995, at 10:32 p.m., at the intersection of 6th Avenue 
East and 4th Street in Duluth, Minnesota, a criminal who should not 
have had a


firearm tried to take my life. I was shot in the head, and by the grace 
of God, I survived.
  A few years after that, while on duty in a hostage situation, another 
criminal pulled a gun on me. Face-to-face, I was staring down the 
barrel of a handgun. The suspect pulled the trigger. The gun 
malfunctioned, and I was in a fight for my life. When it was all over, 
by the grace of God, I was alive. The individual was handcuffed.
  Both those individuals were career criminals.
  Back to when I was shot in the head, Mr. Chair: I begged the U.S. 
attorney, along with our police department, to charge the individual 
with possession of a handgun by a felon. They didn't do it. That 
individual was allowed to circumvent our community for another 8 years 
before he was finally put in prison, where he belonged. No more harming 
other people.
  Representative Collins' Mass Violence Prevention Act gets the county 
attorneys and our Federal attorneys present to prosecute these 
individuals who have no respect for life.
  I carried a handgun for 23 years, Mr. Chair, as a tool to defend my 
life or somebody else's life from great bodily harm. I support the 
individual right of law-abiding citizens, the right to keep and bear 
arms.
  Both my wife and I live in rural Minnesota. When we need to protect 
ourselves, when it takes awhile for law enforcement to get there, we 
have the ability.
  There is nobody I know who wants somebody who is going through a 
mental health issue or a career criminal or a drug dealer to have 
these.
  We need to start respecting life. Life is precious, from conception 
to natural death. I am a very proud husband of an Iraq war veteran who 
understands the value of life.
  Mr. Chair, I rise against this. There are better ways to get mothers 
and fathers, county attorneys, Federal prosecutors, local police 
departments, and sheriff departments to work together to have a fusion 
center so, when a young individual types into a computer ``I want to be 
a mass school shooter,'' there is an instant response to identify the 
individual and work through it.",S001212,2019-02-27

friend and former colleague, Gabby Giffords, was shot and nearly 
killed.
  When she was by our side to introduce the bill, she said: ``Speaking 
is still difficult for me, but I don't think I can make myself more 
clear: Congress must act to make our country safer from gun violence.''
  Now is that time. We have waited too long to close loopholes that let 
people easily avoid background checks through private sales. I have 
cried with too many survivors and attended too many funerals. I have 
marched with too many student activists, and I have bowed my head 
through too many moments of silence.
  We know strong gun laws work. In the 25 years since the Brady law 
took effect, background checks have stopped more than $3 million in gun 
sales and have saved countless lives.
  It is time to expand the Brady law. It is time to close the dangerous 
loopholes. It is past time for Congress to take action to save lives 
from gun violence.
  Mr. Chair, this is not a moment of silence. This is not a sit-in. 
This is action by the United States House of Representatives on behalf 
of everyone who has pled for that action after San Bernardino and after 
Sutherland Springs and after Fort Hood and after Virginia Tech and 
after Columbine and Sandy Hook and Las Vegas and Pulse and everyday gun 
violence in our communities and, yes, after Parkland.

Amendment rights of law-abiding Nebraskans.
  In Nebraska, the need for firearms is the same today as it was even 
when the Second Amendment was enacted before we were even a territory 
of the United States.
  Rural Nebraskans depend on their firearms for self-defense and for 
protecting their livestock. They also know how to handle firearms, to 
store them securely, to handle them appropriately, and perhaps to even 
let neighbors who are able to use them safely borrow them to meet their 
needs.
  I have serious concerns. The bills we are considering today and 
tomorrow are going to criminalize this behavior for Nebraskans who have 
done this for generations and won't even know that they are breaking 
the law.
  Should a rancher who lends a rifle to a neighbor to address threats 
from predatory animals face a year in prison and a $100,000 fine? No.
  Should a legally carrying farmer who is injured at work be subject to 
arrest for handing his firearm off before being taken to the hospital? 
No.
  These are exactly the situations this bill would create, while doing 
little to address the real problems underlying crime in our society.
  Mr. Chair, this is a bad bill, and I urge its swift rejection.

       According to The Washington Post, since 1966, 1077 
     individuals have been fatally shot and wounded as a result of 
     mass shootings in which more than four people perished; 
     Children and teenagers compose about a tenth of these 
     fatalities. Almost 300 guns have been obtained by authorities 
     in these shootings, and over half of them were obtained 
     legally. The AR-15 rifle has been increasingly used in such 
     shootings, with the latest being in this month's most recent 
     high school shooting in Florida. It is estimated that more 
     than 8 million of these weapons are owned in American 
     households. The trend in mass shootings has been rising 
     notably since 2006-07.

1113,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,39,Ms. JACKSON LEE,"  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank Moms Demand Action, and I thank 
all those who have offered themselves in this fight. I thank our chair, 
Mr. Thompson, for his constant and persistent work.
  Through my tenure as ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland 
Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, and now third in seniority 
on the Judiciary Committee, it has given me a picture that many have 
not seen, and that is that we have been fighting for gun safety 
legislation for almost three decades.
  It seems that even though Mr. Cohen is in a hearing right now where 
facts are being disputed, there are no facts to dispute the fact that 
people die from guns. And those who get guns are never regulated.
  By no means do I want you not to have a handgun to protect yourself, 
or to enforce gun trafficking laws, or to make sure that prosecutors 
prosecute those for gun possession, but it begs the question. What is 
the question? The interpretation of the Second Amendment is no one 
should prohibit the right to bear arms. As I stand here today, there is 
nothing in the underlying bill that is prohibiting that.
  It is simply common sense and giving dignity to those who died at the 
Columbine High School shooting, the Atlanta shooting, the Wedgwood 
Baptist Church shooting, the Lockheed Martin shooting, the Living 
Church of God shooting, the Red Lake High School shooting, the Northern 
Illinois University shooting, the Santa Fe shooting in Texas, the 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and the Sutherland 
Springs church shooting in Texas.
  It says that you have to have a check, a background check. It closes 
the gun show loophole. It gives exemptions for the issues of domestic 
violence and sexual assault. It allows families to transfer, and 
ranchers, farmers, and fishers to transfer.
  My God, what more do we want? People have died. Are we not going to 
show that we are committed to saving lives, not to abuse the Second 
Amendment, to misuse it? We can bear arms. But the question is whether 
or not we will recognize that there are 350-plus million Americans, and 
there are more guns in this country than there are citizens.
  I beg of my colleagues: Stop the violence. Vote for this bill.
  Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an 
original co-sponsor, I rise in strong of H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that strengthens the 
background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.
  A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms 
acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not 
required to run a background check and that 96 percent of inmates who 
were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they 
committed their crime obtained their gun this way.
  This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not 
conduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers 
sell a large number of guns.
  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make 
it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, 
manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who 
is not so licensed without a background check.
  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be 
required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary 
background check before the transfer could be finalized.
  H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy means of 
ensuring firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.
  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) 
demonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks 
System (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to 
99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within 
90 seconds.
  We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the 
countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue 
to claim so many innocent lives.
  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-
straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.
  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that 
there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more 
than 2015.
  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 
11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.
  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and 
violence deterrence.
  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355 
mass shootings in 2015.
  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School 
in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.
  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, 
with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.
  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large 
crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las 
Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.
  On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist 
Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old 
Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.
  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, 
resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.
  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--
as much as 114 percent higher than other states.
  A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found 
that for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate, 
there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.
  Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such 
as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.
  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.
  This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the 
solution.
  Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the 
wrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons 
used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.
  We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are 
the root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.
  We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues 
that plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite 
plague across the nation.
  My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement 
after four of his officers were shot while on duty.
  He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have 
accomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun 
violence.
  Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long 
overdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
  That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of 
addressing the epidemic.


  Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the 
proposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least 
one life, then it is worth it.
  I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Congressman 
Mike Thompson, for his leadership of the Gun Violence Prevention Task 
Force and for introducing this timely and important legislation.
  Congressman Thompson sat in the audience during the entirety of the 
Gun Safety Hearing on February 13, 2019, demonstrating his longstanding 
commitment to the issue.
  Also helping to bring us to this point today is Congresswoman Robin 
Kelly of Illinois, who represents one of the most affected districts 
when it comes to gun violence.
  She is a valiant leader who will not rest until the Congress finds 
solutions for communities like hers and others all over this country.
  I want to thank Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor from the Parkland School 
Shooting, for testifying as a witness at the House Judiciary Gun Safety 
Hearing.
  Her heartfelt and vivid testimony was met with a standing ovation by 
the crowded audience in the hearing.
  Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun 
violence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, 
both prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual 
statements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.
  Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the 
question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to 
address a public-health epidemic?''
  I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''
  We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority 
members.
  We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.
  And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President 
and the gun lobby.
  I am a defender and supporter of the Constitution.
  I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our 
citizens.
  However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest 
divine right of all.
  I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not 
at the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and 
law enforcement officials.
  Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to 
undergo ``active shooter'' drills.
  Imagine having children in grade school today.
  Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious 
lives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or 
AR-15.
  Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not 
include active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.
  We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to 
pass H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.''",J000032,2019-02-27

1115,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,41,Mr. BYRNE,"  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. Let's 
be very clear on this: H.R. 8 will not prevent criminals from getting 
their hands on firearms. What H.R. 8 will do is violate the 
constitutional rights of millions of Americans.
  Under this bill, almost every time a lawful gun owner wants to 
transfer or sell a gun, he or she will have to go through a government-
sanctioned intermediary. Under this bill, no longer could I let my 
cousin or my neighbor borrow my gun. If this bill becomes law, 
overnight, millions of law-abiding gun owners could suddenly be subject 
to Federal prosecution. Of course, we all know that criminals are going 
to do what they already do: make illegal transfers of firearms.
  We have heard a lot about how this is going to be the most open 
Congress in history. Well, Mr. Chair, I filed an amendment that would 
strip out the text of H.R. 8 and replace it with a nationwide concealed 
carry reciprocity. Mr. Chair, the Democratic leadership blocked a vote 
on my amendment. What are they so afraid of? I guess they think they 
can shield their Members from votes to protect the Second Amendment and 
benefit our Nation's law-abiding gun owners.
  Mr. Chair, I have news for the majority. Gun owners of America are 
watching this debate. They know what H.R. 8 is all about, and they know 
that this is just a sham to chip away at the Second Amendment and our 
Constitution.
  I will oppose this bill and any bill that goes against the Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting ``no'' and fighting against this assault on the Second 
Amendment.",B001289,2019-02-27

  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill. Atlanta, 
Chicago, Pittsburgh, Parkland, Charleston, Oak Creek, Newtown, Orlando, 
Las Vegas, and many other places: How many more must suffer? How many 
more must die?
  For years, the people spoke up. Mothers called. Fathers cried. 
Students marched. But Congress offered a blind eye or a deaf ear to 
their cries.
  Today, we say to those who begged and pleaded for us to act that we 
see you. We feel your pain. We heard your cries, and we are going to 
answer today, now.
  We sat in on this floor. I want to thank the chair of our task force, 
  Mike Thompson, for never giving up, for never giving in, for keeping 
the faith, for keeping your eyes on the prize. We are doing the right 
thing today.
  We have a mission. We have an obligation and a mandate to pass this 
bipartisan bill that must become public law.

``yes.'' It is good. It is the right thing to do to save lives and to 
stop this madness.",L000287,2019-02-27

8. I commend the efforts of Congressman   Mike Thompson from California 
for introducing this commonsense legislation.
  What it simply does is require that all sales of firearms go through 
a licensed firearms dealer who has to run a background check. Current 
law mandates that all licensed gun dealers, before transferring a 
weapon, have to perform a background check.
  The problem we have in this country is the law allows unlicensed 
firearms dealers competing with licensed firearms dealers to sell just 
as many firearms as a licensed gun dealer, but without doing the 
background check. That enables criminals and people who should not have 
weapons to have firearms, and that contributes to the proliferation of 
weaponry on our streets in the hands of those who should not have them.
  It produces violence, and we are looking to stop the violence with 
this legislation, and so I ask my colleagues to support it.",J000288,2019-02-27

Americans that their children's right to learn without fear; that their 
own right to dance at a concert, worship at a synagogue, shop at the 
mall; that all those rights to come home, to live, and to love are 
greater than any other right in the Constitution.
  This bill puts in place an expansion of violent history checks on 
firearm purchases where there were too many gaps before.
  It will not end every gun violence death in America, but we should 
try. It also will get rid of this argument about States like California 
and Illinois, where you have gun violence. You can no longer say, well, 
they have tough background checks there, so it is not working. Well, 
no, we are only as safe as the lowest common denominator. If our States 
like Nevada and Arizona have low restrictions when it comes to 
purchasing a firearm, we are only as safe as they are.
  We will have a nationwide background check that will make sure that 
all of us are safe. We are here, Mr. Chair, because of Mr. Thompson, 
because of Moms Demand Action, because of Everytown for Gun Safety, and 
because of March For Our Lives.

bill is long overdue. For too long, Congress has failed to end the 
cycle of gun violence and death that too many families are now familiar 
with.
  In 2017 alone, 40,000 people died from gun violence. Congress did 
nothing. Last year, five reporters at the Capital Gazette in my 
district were murdered in cold blood in a mass shooting that took place 
in their newsroom. Congress did nothing.
  Gun violence is a crisis in our communities and a real national 
emergency that will no longer be met with inaction.
  For the first time since Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence 
Prevention Act of 1994, we will pass a bill in pursuit of our effort to 
protect our communities and end this scourge of gun violence.
  The American people overwhelmingly want us to act. For the people, we 
will pass universal background checks out of the House as our first 
piece of comprehensive gun safety reform.

because you know the tide, you know the toll that takes place every 
day. On average, every day in America, 342 people are shot: murders, 
assaults, suicides, or suicide attempts. That means every single day--
yesterday, tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day--100 people, on 
average, will die of gun violence and another 200 or more will 
literally be wounded or shot in the crossfire.
  We know that, in 2017, more than 39,000, nearly 40,000 people died of 
gun violence, all kinds of gun violence. That was an extraordinary 
uptick in gun violence.
  I carry with me today the picture of Ben Wheeler, whose courageous 
mother testified before the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 
2014.
  I carry with me today a picture of Ron, the son of my dear friend, 
Marge, who died of gun violence by suicide.
  I carry with me, not by picture, but in my heart, the 16-year-old son 
of my former student at La Salle University who was shot in random gun 
violence in the city of Philadelphia.

and six families were forever changed by gun violence in a 6-day 
period. Four people were killed and two were injured in six different 
shootings. One person was 28. The other five were 16, 17, and 18. They 
were teenagers. My heart goes out to all of those victims' families.
  Thoughts and prayers are no longer enough. It is long past time that 
our actions speak louder than our words. No matter which State we are 
from, with over 40,000 gun violence deaths last year, every State has 
been severely impacted by gun violence.
  The public health crisis has been politicized and weaponized as a 
means to divide us, despite the fact that it is a crisis that should 
bind us together, and we must come together.


  Background checks are the foundation of commonsense gun policy, and 
they are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans. Our 
current system fails us in two ways, but the bills we are looking at 
this week are designed to address that.
  Under current law, firearm sales can proceed regardless if a good 
background check comes back within a 3-day period, and it doesn't 
capture all the sales. So this puts an incredible burden on law 
enforcement and an incredible burden on ATF agents who have to go and 
reclaim guns that are sold, despite the owner of the gun not being able 
to pass the background check. So for too long those in a position to 
act have failed to do so. But that ends now.
  I strongly support the commonsense gun legislation in H.R. 8 and H.R.

  My friend, the gentleman from Georgia, just rose and said that this 
won't work. We have risen on this floor time after time after time 
after time and had a moment of silence followed by no action.
  As I said time after time, we have had a moment of silence. I will 
tell my friend from Georgia that it hasn't worked. It has been 
appropriate, but it has not worked.
  Can we guarantee that this will work to make every person safe?
  It cannot. It will not. But I rise in strong support of doing 
something, and in this case doing something that 90 percent of America 
supports.
  Mr. Chairman, this House is finally going to do its job and take 
action--not just a moment of silence, but action--to address the 
epidemic of gun violence in our country.
  After the tragedies at Sandy Hook, Orlando, Las Vegas, Charleston, 
the Tree of Life synagogue, and Great Mills High School in my district, 
the House, under the previous leadership, did nothing. It didn't work.
  After the shooting just down the street at the Washington Navy Yard, 
the Republican-controlled House did nothing. Three of the victims of 
that attack were constituents of mine living in southern Maryland. Dr. 
Wendy Edmonds and Wanda Wallace are in the gallery, Mr. Chairman. They 
are the sisters of Sylvia Fraser, a Navy Yard shooting victim.
  Montana Geimer, daughter of Wendi Winters, a writer for the Capital 
Gazette of which my colleague, Mr. Brown, just spoke; and Mackenzie 
Boughey, a high school student who organized a March for Our Lives 
rally in Anne Arundel County, are here with us today not to have a 
moment of silence, but to have a moment of action.
  Many of our districts have been painfully affected by gun violence. 
In St. Mary's County in Maryland, as I told you, Mr. Chairman, a 
student was killed by a shooter at Great Mills High School, and a 
courageous school resources officer there saved countless other lives. 
In Annapolis, five staff members of the Capital Gazette were gunned 
down in their newsroom.
  For years, the American people have demanded action to address gun 
violence. After the Parkland shooting, just over a year ago, students 
marched in cities from coast to coast to demand that Congress protect 
them in the classroom, in the streets, in houses of worship, and in all 
public gathering places.
  I, as I am sure many of you have, had the opportunity to meet with 
many of the students who participated in the March for Our Lives and 
heard the determination in their voices as they spoke about working to 
achieve a future where students would no longer have to practice 
active-shooter drills in their schools. I found their courage and 
persistence deeply inspiring.
  Now, with a change in the majority control, we are bringing to the 
floor legislation supported by, as I said, nine out of ten Americans, 
including a majority of responsible gun owners to expand criminal 
background checks to make sure that those who have a criminal past, a 
past of violence--domestic or otherwise--a mental health problem, or 
are on the no-fly list because they are perceived as possibly 
terrorists, won't be able to buy a gun.
  Does that mean they won't get a gun?
  It does not. I understand that. But as I told my friend from Georgia, 
the moments of silence have not worked. They were appropriate, I 
understand, but they didn't work.


  We will also be voting this week on legislation offered by our whip, 
Mr. Clyburn, to close the loophole that contributed to the horrific 
mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston in 2015.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass the 
legislation we advance, and I call on the President to sign it without 
delay.
  Mr. Chairman, let us not have a moment of silence for this 
legislation. Do not let it die. Do not let the hope that it provides 
die. Do not let us stand by one more time to lament the death of a 
constituent, a friend, a neighbor, a fellow citizen, who dies at the 
hand of a gun purchased illegally or by someone who should not have a 
gun.
  This is not about taking away guns. It is about preventing guns 
getting in the hands of people who do bad things, and we can predict 
that they are a danger to others. Let us not have a moment of silence 
for this bill. Let us pass it. Let the Senate pass it. Let the 
President sign it. Let's make an effort at least to stop the carnage.",H000874,2019-02-27

may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the words of the majority leader. However, 
I will say that in the previous Congress, this Congress did pass Fix 
NICS. It also passed the STOP School Violence Act. I am sure, among 
other reasons, it is probably why the majority leader voted against 
those bills in which they were included.

  I do agree with him. The moments of silence may not have stopped, but 
it did call upon a higher power to realize that we are fragile human 
beings involved in tragedies. I will also remind the folks, and Mr. 
Chairman, yourself, that this bill will also not do what it has many 
times been promoted for it to do, because any of these mass violence 
episodes would not have been affected by this bill.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
Scalise).",C001093,2019-02-27
1139,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,65,Mr. SCALISE,"  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to these gun 
control bills that are being brought forward. They are brought forward 
under the guise of background checks.
  Let's look at what these bills would actually do. We had identified 
any number of problems with this bill that we were trying to improve, 
and every one of those was shut out, shut out by the Democratic 
majority who wanted to try to stifle the opposing side's debate because 
they think just saying background checks makes this a good bill.
  Let's talk about what this bill will do to make criminals--felons--
out of law-abiding citizens. If you loan your gun to a friend under 
this bill, maybe they are thinking of buying a similar gun to protect 
themselves and they want to go to a shooting range to see if this gun 
is the right kind of gun to protect themselves with, which they have a 
right to do under the Second Amendment of this Constitution, loaning 
your gun to that friend in that act would make you a felon subject to a 
year in jail and subject to a $100,000 fine, Mr. Chairman.
  We tried to fix that. They shut that amendment out.
  In this bill, if you loan your gun to a friend who maybe has been a 
victim of domestic violence--and one of my colleagues who is here in 
opposition to this bill is one of those victims of domestic violence. 
She had an amendment to fix this bill to say, if she has got a 
temporary restraining order against her boyfriend who has been beating 
her and she is afraid he is going to come back tonight, under one of 
the bills, if she goes to buy a gun tonight and the Fix NICS system 
isn't working, she may have 20 business days to get that gun.
  Now, good luck if the boyfriend shows up to beat her up that night 
and she says: Don't worry, I am on day 8. I only have another 12 days 
before I can buy the gun. Will you come back so I can defend myself 
then?
  Do you really think that is going to happen?
  You know what that means to her.
  So in the bill we said: What if you can loan your gun to her?
  She goes to a friend and says: I know you have a gun. I don't have a 
gun. I am trying to protect myself because I have got a TRO, but I know 
he is probably going to come back.
  Under this bill, you will be a felon, a year in jail, $100,000 fine. 
We tried to fix that, too, Mr. Chairman, and they shut that amendment 
out. That is what this bill does.
  Oh, by the way, we are talking about law-abiding citizens here. If 
you go hunting with a buddy and you try to loan your gun to a buddy, 
Mr. Chairman, they say there is an exemption in the bill. But it is 
written so vaguely that you not only need to bring your hunting 
partner, you might need to bring your attorney to find out if loaning 
your shotgun to your friend makes you a felon under this bill.
  These are law-abiding citizens. These are people who use guns to 
defend themselves, which is the basis of the Second Amendment. Our 
Founding Fathers believed every American has the right to defend 
themselves, because every day, on average, in this country guns are 
used by good people to defend themselves against bad people, and it is 
going to make it harder for them to get access to these guns to defend 
themselves. So, again, we tried to fix some of these problems.
  Mr. Chairman, let me tell you about another problem we tried to 
identify and fix. If you loan your gun, you will be a felon.",S001176,2019-02-27

citizens can become felons. We tried to fix it; they wanted that to 
stay in place.
  So what is that motivation?
  But then we identified another problem. If someone who is in this 
country illegally goes to buy a gun and the system flags them, and it 
says: Wait a minute, this person is not even here legally. They are 
breaking Federal law trying to buy a gun. We said that we should notify 
ICE so at least our Border Patrol agents in the interior can deport 
them. They blocked that amendment.
  So now a law-abiding citizen can become a felon under their bill, but 
someone who is here illegally trying to buy a gun in violation of the 
law can't be turned over to authorities. This is a bad gun control 
bill, and we ought to reject it.",S001176,2019-02-27

yielding.
  I was asked to talk about some of the outrageous allegations that 
were made about this bill, and the chairman already cleared one up, and 
that is the $100,000 fine that we are hearing from the other side. It 
is $1,000, as was pointed out.
  We also heard that this isn't constitutional. Well, the Constitution 
is pretty clear: Individuals have a right to bear arms. Nobody is 
disputing that. As a matter of fact, it was settled in District of 
Columbia v. Heller.
  But also in that opinion were Justice Scalia's remarks that stated 
that government also has a responsibility and a right to regulate 
firearms. That is all we are doing.
  We are saying that people who are felons, domestic abusers, 
dangerously mentally ill, a danger to themselves or others shouldn't be 
able to have guns. I don't think anybody can dispute that. And how do 
you find out if you don't do a background check?
  My friends on the other side of the aisle said this won't work. We 
have


heard it a hundred times: This won't work. Well, we have been working 
on this for 6\1/2\ years, ever since Sandy Hook. We have pleaded with 
the other side to work with us, have a hearing.
  What are your ideas?
  Absolute silence from them. Absolute silence.
  This does work. We know that licensed dealers stop the sale of 
firearms to 170 felons every day and 50 domestic abusers every day 
because they are required to do background checks.
  But in some States, that same individual can be found to be 
prohibited, walk outside and go to a gun show or go online and buy a 
gun without the benefit of a background check--and that is wrong.
  Countless speakers from the other side of the aisle said this 
wouldn't have stopped this crime, this wouldn't have stopped this mass 
shooting, this wouldn't have stopped that mass shooting. Well, my 
friends, if that is your standard, if you will only support a bill that 
will stop every mass shooting, that will stop every death by a firearm, 
that means you want to get rid of all guns, and no one on this side of 
the aisle is saying that.",T000460,2019-02-27

allowing me the time.
  I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8 and want to lay out a couple of 
reasons for my opposition.
  Before I do, I think it is important to acknowledge how polarizing 
this debate has become over the last several years. More specifically, 
I want this body to know that, as a human being, as an American, as a 
father, when I see the heartbreaking news of a mass shooting like the 
one we saw just 54 weeks ago in Parkland, it just breaks my heart.
  With that being said, this bill that we are voting on today would not 
have done anything to stop that tragedy from happening, nor would it 
have prevented any of those recent mass shootings.
  The 19-year-old murderer in Parkland passed a background check.
  The man who murdered 26 innocent people at First Baptist Church in 
Sutherland Springs also passed a background check, although he wouldn't 
have if the Air Force had passed along his criminal information like 
they were supposed to have done.
  And the evil that took place in Sandy Hook wouldn't have been stopped 
by this bill either. The killer used his mother's guns to kill her and 
26 others. They were bought legally.
  Mr. Chairman, the simple fact is that criminals don't abide by the 
law, and this would only create traps for law-abiding gun owners.
  However, there are actions that we can take, actions that we can do, 
that would make meaningful strides in combating the violence that we 
see today.
  One example of something we could do, improve information sharing 
between law enforcement officials across this country.
  Mr. Chair, to close, I disagree with the policy of this bill.",B001305,2019-02-27

  Mr. Chair, we have heard the other side here say that some people lie 
on the forms; they are not prosecuted. Well, that may be, and maybe law 
enforcement ought to prosecute more people.
  That doesn't negate the necessity for the bill. It doesn't negate the 
fact that too many people who shouldn't have guns, who are mentally 
unstable, who have committed crimes, and who are abusers get guns 
because they buy a gun at a gun show or not from a registered gun 
dealer and, therefore, do not have to undergo a background check.

  Everyone who gets a gun should have to undergo a background check, 
with the few exceptions we put in the bill.
  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is legislation that is long overdue for passage 
by this body and for enactment so that we can take a critical step 
overwhelmingly supported by the American people to protect us from gun 
violence.
  We have had too many moments of silence, too many expressions of 
sympathy, too many deaths--39,000 deaths from guns last year--but 
little action here in Congress on this issue.
  Today we act. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this vital 
bill to start taking back our streets from the killers, to start 
blocking people who shouldn't have them from having guns.
  Save our lives.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.",N000002,2019-02-27

1993--which took effect on February 28, 1994--it was to keep firearms 
out of the hands of dangerous persons including felons and abusers.
  Twenty-five years later--and 300 million background checks that have 
blocked 3 million purchases to dangerous individuals--few if any today 
seriously suggest that the Brady law should be repealed.
  I support the Second Amendment. Universal background checks 
prescribed in H.R. 8 are an attempt to ensure that firearms are 
procured, owned and used by responsible, law abiding citizens.
  According to the Brady Campaign, about 1 in 5 guns now sold in 
America are done so without a background check. That's a significant 
loophole.
  According to the CDC, there was a record 39,773 deaths from firearms 
in 2017--higher than in any other year--23,854 were self-inflicted and 
14,542 were homicides.
  To mitigate gun violence in America, H.R. 8 expands Brady background 
checks to transactions by private sellers not currently covered by the 
law.
  Multiple school shootings have led to robust, comprehensive action at 
every level to make classrooms safer. I have visited many schools in my 
district--and I have found that while the threat is being taken 
seriously, no one policy, program or initiative can ensure the level of 
protection our students need and deserve.
  Mr. Chair, no constitutional right is absolute including the Second 
Amendment. The First Amendment's freedom of speech, for example, has 
reasonable limits including the promulgation of slander and libel law.
  To preserve public order, we accept reasonable restrictions on the 
freedom to assemble. Even freedom of religion isn't without some modest 
boundaries.
  In like manner, universal background checks don't erode Second 
Amendment rights but do help ensure much needed protection from gun 
violence for everyone.",S000522,2019-02-27

the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.
  This year, my State of the Union guest was Alexandria Goddard, a 
young activist who helped organize Portland's March for Our Lives.
  Alexandria led thousands of Oregonians in a march to demand that 
Congress take action to prevent gun violence.
  By passing this bill we are heeding the call of the hundreds of 
thousands of students who marched for their lives.
  They know--and we know--that this bill will save lives because it 
requires a background check for nearly all firearm sales and transfers.
  The evidence shows that Oregon and the other states that have already 
passed comprehensive background checks have 35 percent fewer gun 
deaths, and 47 percent fewer women shot by their intimate partners.
  Congress is finally doing more than offering thoughts and prayers.
  We are acting. We are acting for Parkland, for Sandy Hook, for Umpqua 
Community College, and for the hundreds of thousands of victims and 
survivors around the country.
  I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 8.",B001278,2019-02-27

H.R. 8, The Bipartisan Background Check Act of 2019. This


common sense bipartisan legislation would expand the current firearm 
background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales 
nationwide.
  Our nation is currently enduring a crisis that is putting families 
and communities at risk. Gun violence has become so commonplace in our 
society that we no longer seem to flinch whenever these events occur. 
Gun violence threatens national security and inflicts a toll. 125,000 
people are shot every year and more than 36,000 people die as a result 
of these shootings. A 2018 report conducted by the Centers for Disease 
Control & Prevention revealed that there were 3,353 firearm-related 
deaths in my home state of Texas. 352 of these were children and 
teenagers under 19 years old. Texas unfortunately has played host to 
some of the most viscous recent mass shootings, such as the 2009 Fort 
Hood shooting, the Dallas police officer shooting in 2016, the Plano 
and Sutherland Springs Church shootings in 2017, and last year's Santa 
Fe High School shooting.
  We have high levels of gun violence in this country because we have 
weak laws that are riddled with loopholes. This bill will not only 
eliminate those loopholes, but it will do so without infringing upon 
second amendment rights. Implementing universal background checks is 
supported by 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun 
owners.
  The reality is that gun safety laws will reduce violence and we must 
do everything in our power to prevent the reoccurrence of unnecessary 
tragedy and loss of life in this country. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.",J000126,2019-02-27

1168,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,94,Mrs. LESKO,"  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow gun owners to 
legally transfer their firearms to individuals who have been approved 
and are participants in TSA's PreCheck program.
  TSA PreCheck identifies trusted travelers and, thus, allows expedited 
movement through airport security. In order to receive TSA PreCheck, 
one must submit an application, have an in-person interview, and go 
through a background check and fingerprinting.


  Fingerprinting is not required, currently, to purchase a gun; thus, a 
TSA PreCheck background check is more stringent. If an individual can 
pass this background check and be admitted to this Federal Government 
program, there is no reason why they shouldn't be able to borrow a 
firearm from a friend. They have already gone through a more extensive 
background check system than to acquire a weapon. The current 
background check does not require fingerprints; a TSA PreCheck does.
  Membership to TSA PreCheck must be renewed every 5 years. Again, the 
TSA PreCheck process requires fingerprints and an in-person interview. 
The process, currently, for purchasing a gun requires neither of those 
under Federal law. It appears, then, that the TSA PreCheck process is a 
more extensive process.
  H.R. 8 restricts not only the purchase, but also the everyday gun 
transfer for law-abiding citizens. This amendment and many other 
Republican amendments--I think I had five others that were not made in 
order--seek to give some relief to law-abiding citizens from this 
overarching and burdensome legislation.
  In H.R. 8, we are not only talking about the purchase of firearms, we 
are talking about the transfer of firearms, which includes lending your 
firearm. The Democrats have proposed a bill that would criminalize 
millions of law-abiding Americans. Because this bill uses ambiguous, 
overarching, and vague language, it encompasses so many potential 
situations. This amendment seeks to give some relief.
  If we are going to allow Americans to be given expedited and reduced 
screening in our most sensitive and secure environments in the U.S. 
airport getting on a plane, why wouldn't we allow them to lend a gun to 
their friend?
  H.R. 8 criminalizes me and others just for handing someone a firearm 
who isn't a direct family member or in other very narrow situations. In 
fact, as I said yesterday, the language in this bill is so ambiguous. 
What is ``imminent danger''? There is no definition in the bill.

it is fatally flawed and would undermine the public safety impact of 
the bill.
  The amendment would add an exception to the background check 
requirement for anyone who is a participant in the TSA PreCheck program 
by the Department of Homeland Security.
  By exempting those who have obtained a TSA PreCheck from the 
background check requirement, the amendment would allow many dangerous 
people, including people with disqualifying mental health conditions 
and some criminal convictions, to obtain firearms without a background 
check.
  The current background system, the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System, was designed specifically for background 
checks pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.
  The system, often called the NICS, contains the information that no 
other Federal database contains, and the TSA does not check NICS when 
determining a person's eligibility for the TSA PreCheck program.
  Although participants in the TSA PreCheck program have had their 
criminal backgrounds vetted, the standards for approval and 
participation in the TSA PreCheck program are not the same and, in many 
cases, are more lenient than those which prohibit firearm possession 
and purchase.
  For example, the NICS searches the records of people prohibited for 
mental health reasons during a firearms background check. These mental 
health reasons, though, are not part of the TSA PreCheck search.
  As of January 31, there are more than 5.7 million of these mental 
health records in the NICS indexes, making it the second most populous 
category of prohibited records for firearm purchase.
  Because the Department of Homeland Security does not have access to 
these mental health records for TSA PreCheck program purposes, 
individuals who have been adjudicated to be disqualified to own 
firearms for reasons of mental condition or have been committed to any 
mental institution may be accepted under the TSA PreCheck program but 
are not legally able to possess a gun. Under this amendment, they would 
be legally exempted from the background check requirement and would be 
able to get a gun, despite being legally prohibited from doing so.
  The TSA bars people convicted of certain criminal offenses, such as 
rape or aggravated sexual abuse, from participating in the TSA PreCheck 
program only temporarily. It doesn't restrict people convicted of these 
serious crimes for more than 7 years, and it wouldn't bar people 
released from prison for these crimes within the last 5 years.
  Under current law, these felony convictions prohibit possession or 
purchase of a weapon, but, under this amendment, people released from 
prison within the last 5 years for these crimes could get the weapons--
could get the weapons.
  The TSA PreCheck program does not have a minimum age requirement, and 
this amendment would allow people under the ages of 18 and 21 to 
purchase firearms illegally and without a NICS background check.
  Furthermore, the TSA PreCheck program only requires a background 
check every 5 years, and the PreCheck system may not be advised that a 
firearms disqualifying offense has taken place after the initial 
PreCheck background check has occurred.
  In other words, you get the TSA PreCheck, and if you are convicted 
afterwards, within 5 years, for a very serious crime, under this 
amendment, you could get the gun, although, legally, you shouldn't 
without a background check, and the TSA PreCheck program would not have 
picked it up.


  These shortcomings of the TSA PreCheck system make it an inadequate 
and dangerous substitute for a NICS background check. To prevent 
potentially prohibited purchasers from obtaining firearms, licensed 
dealers should conduct background checks on participants in the 
PreCheck program as they would with any other member of the public.
  The blanket exception of this amendment for anyone who participates 
in the TSA PreCheck program would undermine the bill's ability to 
enhance public safety because it would enable people convicted of 
serious crimes, people adjudicated to have serious mental illnesses, to 
purchase guns without a background check, even though the TSA system 
would not pick them up.
  The TSA system is not a substitute for the background check system. 
It doesn't pick up many of the crimes. It doesn't carry it forward. And 
it is not a substitute for this system.
  To pass this amendment, which would allow people who have qualified 
under the TSA PreCheck program not to have background checks, would 
allow a lot of people who shouldn't have guns to have them. Therefore, 
I strongly oppose this amendment, and I ask that my colleagues vote 
``no'' on this amendment.

  Mr. Nadler, in his statement, said that my amendment would allow 
dangerous people to get guns. I have to say I disagree.
  I am the ranking member on the Committee on Homeland Security 
subcommittee that deals with TSA, and the TSA PreCheck system is more 
stringent than the background check currently required to obtain a gun, 
when you purchase it. Again, it requires a fingerprint background check 
and an individual interview. Neither of those are required right now.
  We had offered a number of amendments to help this bill become less 
burdensome on law-abiding citizens, and so I am happy that one was at 
least ruled in order, this TSA one, and I would ask my colleagues to 
please vote ``yes'' on it.

  I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act of 2019. My amendment clarifies that those at risk of 
committing suicide would be exempt from the background check 
requirement in instances of imminent threats of death or great bodily 
harm.
  Specifically, this legislation amends the bill to insert the line 
``including harm to self, family, household members, or others'' to the 
list of instances when a person is exempt from the background check 
requirement and may temporarily transfer away a firearm for 
safekeeping.
  The spirit of this long overdue legislation is to save lives, and I 
urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which will further achieve 
this goal by addressing the leading instance of gun death in this 
country, suicide.
  Last year, nearly 40,000 people were killed by gun violence, with 
another 80,000 literally caught in the crossfire. Of those killed, over 
half, more than 20,000, people tragically died by gun suicide.
  And the problem has grown. Nationally, over the past years, the past 
decade, the rate of suicide by gun death has increased 19 percent. This 
is a problem that grips our entire Nation.
  In my home State of Pennsylvania, there has been a 24 percent 
increase in gun suicides over the past 10 years, claiming the lives of 
over 14,000 people. These are our friends, our loved ones, young and 
old, people for whom our hearts ache, people we wish we could hold just 
one more time.
  I offer up a picture of a dear friend of my family, Ron.
  Unfortunately, very few of us are left unscathed by this problem. 
While there are many factors that contribute to self-harm, the presence 
of a firearm in the home increases the risk of suicide. Not 
surprisingly, using a gun is the method that most often ends in death.
  Guns are dangerously effective at what they are designed to do. That 
is why this amendment is so important. It ensures that those in crisis 
can temporarily transfer a firearm safely until the crisis has passed. 
It clearly defines that a person can temporarily hand over firearms to 
someone they trust while they work through this difficult time.
  This clarity is needed because, in times of crisis, moments matter. 
It may literally be the difference between life and death.
  We are here today at a historic moment to take action against the 
violence that plagues this country, our communities, and our loved 
ones. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, with this 
amendment, will keep guns out of the hands of those who legally should 
not have them and also gives those who need a safe way to separate 
themselves from their guns a way to do so.
  If we have the courage to pass this legislation, the courage here in 
the House and in the Senate and in the White House, it will do just 
that. It will save lives.

the amendment, I think, but I rise in that, again, this is something 
discussed at committee. It was an attempt to--it is basically a failed 
attempt to fix one of the shortcomings of this legislation.
  I understand why they would bring it. I understand why they would 
want to fix it, because its existence indicates what we have been 
saying about the flaws in the bill, which we discussed at committee.
  Like other floor amendments that are going to be offered, this is 
nothing more than trying to basically change the appearance of what is 
a flawed perception. The problem here is it addresses the undefined 
term of ``imminent'' used in the bill.
  Mr. Chairman, it is well known, and I have spoken about it many 
times, that I am still currently serving as a United States Air Force 
chaplain. I have pastored for many years, and I have been on the other 
end of phone calls from those who were struggling and thinking of 
taking their life.
  Suicide is not something that we can define very easily. It is not 
something that we can simply limit to: Yes, guns are effective. But any 
method that someone uses to choose to end their life is sad and a 
struggle for those of us who have dealt with this.
  The term ``imminent'' here is problematic for those of us who have 
dealt with those who are struggling with suicide because imminent to 
them and imminent to a judge and imminent to someone who wants to take 
his life, and to law enforcement, indicates something precipitous that 
will happen in a very short amount of time, a very imminent act, 
something that is maybe going to happen, Mr. Chairman, even before I 
finish my speech. That is an imminent kind of act.
  Imminent does not extend to 12 hours or 24 hours or even 46 hours. 
That would not fall under the definition of ``imminent.'' And I am not 
willing to let a prosecutor or a judge who may not like guns, who would 
actually say that was an imminent threat, and by transferring it for 
more than a short amount of time, you have then fallen under and fall 
under this.
  Now, I would hope that would never happen, Mr. Chairman. But we have 
to be serious about this issue of imminence. For those of us who have 
dealt with this, there may be, and I have had times when people would 
come to me and they were thinking about harming themselves, but the 
imminence factor was not there. They were just trying to see if they 
could clear their head. It may be a week that would pass, and they came 
back and would say it was fine.
  But in this issue, I understand the intent and the heart here, but it 
is a very weak attempt to fix problems that we had already pointed out 
in this bill. And it will still not fix the problem, because the 
problem is the imminent standard. That is the part that we are 
struggling with.
  We can disagree about this, and I will respect the gentlewoman if she 
disagrees, and would expect her to. But let's remember, this is carried 
out, if, say--which I would hope would not happen--this bill actually 
becomes law. It then will present a problem for those who have to 
enforce it and those judges who would have to interpret it.
  We have to remember that our actions here, we vote on words on paper, 
not aspirational ideas. Those are happy thoughts, not words on paper. 
The only thing that the courts can do is vote on words on paper.
  I appreciate the gentlewoman bringing this. I support the intent, 
especially dealing with suicide, which many of us have worked on, and 
the tragedy that it leaves in the wake of so many. But please 
understand my opposition to this is it is still a flawed product 
because we have not dealt with the very issue of imminence in this 
legislation and this amendment.

feels that they are a danger to themselves. They may temporarily 
transfer a firearm until the danger has passed. This is a limited and 
reasonable exemption that only applies to those who fear they will harm 
themselves, so that they may temporary surrender their weapon.

time as I may consume.
  H.R. 8 is a critical piece of legislation that I am proud to support. 
Congress needs to act to cut down on our Nation's widespread gun 
violence. We must close loopholes that give buyers and sellers a way 
around background checks. There is no reason vendors at gun shows or 
online should be exempt from the safety measures other merchants must 
obey. We should also vet sales between two people.
  That is not to say that there should be no exceptions. My amendment 
carves out protections for people who face risk of domestic violence, 
dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.
  The underlying bill, H.R. 8, already creates an exception to the 
background check requirement when there is a temporary weapon transfer, 
if the transferee is at imminent risk of death or great bodily harm. 
Our amendment is meant to make it crystal clear and explicit that this 
exception applies when the transferees are protecting themselves from 
an abuser. It does not expand the underlying exception; it offers one 
critical example of where it might apply.


  When I talked to Oklahomans across my district last year, they 
confided in me their concerns about gun violence. I promised to work 
towards policies that would protect them.
  We need to protect our Second Amendment right, but there is no 
credible reason why we as a state and nation can't acknowledge there 
are steps we can take to save lives and find a path forward to do so.
  H.R. 8 does just that. It increases safety without limiting our 
Second Amendment rights by implementing commonsense policy.
  But when we take these commonsense steps, we need to acknowledge our 
power to create unintended consequences, and to prevent them.
  That is why I am offering this amendment. In addition to my 
commitment to gun safety, I have talked about my devotion to helping 
protect women and families.
  Between 1998 and 2017, the Oklahoma Domestic Violence Fatality Review 
Board found nearly 1,700 people were killed in our State because of 
domestic violence. In 2017 alone, 91 Oklahomans were murdered.
  The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that 
nearly two in five Oklahoma women will face some form of domestic abuse 
or sexual violence during their lifetimes.
  Oklahoma is consistently ranked in the top five States for women 
killed by men in one-on-one homicides.
  Oklahoma domestic violence programs serve an average of 18,000 people 
annually, according to the YWCA.
  Oklahoma is not an exception. These problems persist. One in four 
women and one in nine men experience intimate partner physical 
violence; these people deserve to be protected.
  For us, that means many things, including strengthening and 
reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and investing in support 
services and family justice centers. But it also means we need to 
empower people to protect themselves.
  That is why Congress should pass laws to strengthen background checks 
and create exceptions for those who truly need them.

is coming up. But, again, to put this in, ``great bodily harm,'' it is 
minimally helpful at this point. It goes back to the problem we had 
with ``imminent'' in the last one.
  These are all things, frankly, that could have been--even in a bill 
that I would disagree with at the end of the day on this--this is, 
again, not something that is going to fix it. A victim of domestic 
abuse can live in constant fear of her abuser and feel threatened at 
all times.
  Again, Mr. Chairman, I understand at least the attempt to fix 
something, because they understand that there were problems and they 
don't want to make it worse, but I have advocated all along that what 
this does help, it also hurts. And this is, again, just another attempt 
to do that.
  I appreciate that they are figuring out the problems now; I just 
would oppose this amendment, because, again, it does not completely fix 
the problems that we have seen, and would not in the bigger picture.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-27

for this amendment to H.R. 8 introduced by Representatives Horn and 
Murphy.
  This amendment protects people facing the threat of domestic 
violence, dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and 
domestic abuse.
  I am the daughter of a military veteran, and like most Kansans, I 
respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. But also, 
like most Kansans, I am tired of politicians doing nothing to stop 
senseless killings.
  That is why I support commonsense solutions to keep our communities 
safe, like expanding background checks and closing dangerous loopholes 
in our laws.
  In our effort to ensure the safety of our communities, however, we 
can't forget the needs of those at risk of domestic violence to protect 
themselves from abuse.
  According to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, in 2017 a domestic 
violence incident was reported every 23 minutes and a domestic violence 
murder occurred every 9 days in the State of Kansas.
  In the United States, more than 12 million people experience some 
form of domestic violence by a current or former domestic partner every 
year.
  These women and men deserve our support, which means we also need to 
reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act.
  These men and women deserve to be protected. I cannot emphasize that 
enough.
  Mr. Chair, I am proud to support H.R. 8. It is a critical piece of 
legislation that will save lives, and I urge my fellow colleagues to 
stand up for survivors and those at risk and support this amendment.",D000629,2019-02-27

consume.
  Mr. Chair, my amendment clarifies that the exceptions for gifts and 
loans of firearms between parents and their children applies to 
stepparents and stepchildren.
  The reason I offer this amendment is to recognize that the 
relationship between stepparents and stepchildren is sometimes stronger 
than or as strong as that of the biological parent-child relationship.
  The parents of one of my closest friends are technically stepparents, 
but you would never know it, because they are all so close and love 
each other so much.
  The amendment also clarifies that gifts and loans of firearms among 
family members are still subject to the existing legal standard for all 
transfers.
  Existing law states that no person may deliver a firearm to someone 
if he or she has a reason to believe that the person is prohibited from 
possessing a firearm.
  Consequently, even gifts and loans among family members are not 
permissible if the transferor has a reason to believe that the 
transferee may use the firearm in a crime or is prohibited from 
possessing firearms.
  Again, the amendment clarifies that while a background check is not 
required for these transfers, the existing legal standard continues to 
apply.
  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.",V000133,2019-02-27

amendment, but like the previous amendment, again, it is proof that 
this bill is still not ready for prime time and should have spent more 
time instead of moving a very ill-timed previous question because of a 
timing deadline that they had to get to the floor. It fixes one of the 
many flaws in the bill.
  Again, Republicans had solutions to these loose ends all over the 
bill, but our debate time was stopped. But I do have just a question 
here. Although I am not opposing this amendment, it merely adds the 
exchange between stepparent and their stepchildren.
  What about stepsiblings who also love each other dearly? But this 
doesn't include that. Stepgrandparents and stepgrandchildren? What 
about foster families or adoptive families?
  It is a simple fix that, again, goes forward and, again, struggles.
  But I do want to go back and address something, Mr. Chairman, that 
came up earlier, and it seemed to get an interesting response from my 
friends across the aisle, my colleague stated that the appropriate fine 
is $1,000, not $100,000. They cite the U.S. sentencing guidelines for 
this number, but I do have to remind the chairman that since the Booker 
decision, of course, the guidelines are only advisory. And we need not 
look to the advisory guidelines, but look at the statute the bill 
amends.
  Remember, we do not vote on aspirations in this Chamber; we vote on 
words on paper.
  18 USC 924(a)(5) contains the penalty for violating part ``(s) or (t) 
of section 922 shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more 
than 1 year, or both.''
  18 USC 3571(b)(5) ``for a Class A misdemeanor'', which this is, 
``that does not result in death, not more than $100,000.''
  So it could be $1,000 or it could be up to $100,000.
  I appreciate our confusion over this issue, but unfortunately, as I 
stated before, this is what happens when a bill is rushed to the floor, 
and it is why we oppose this legislation.
  When we understand this, Mr. Chairman, again, you can offer 
amendments that make Members feel good, but feeling good doesn't heal 
you and feeling good will not make this better.
  I will not oppose this amendment, but, again, I think in just the 
moments that I have had here, I raised enough questions about this 
amendment to


take up those very issues that were spoken of about the love between 
stepparents and stepchildren. What about the stepsiblings? What about 
the stepgrandparents? That is still part of that device and not 
addressed in this.
  And, again, going back to the issue of the fine: again, the statute 
and the bill itself are pretty clear; it is fined under this process 
and not the guidelines that are sentencing.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-27

  Mr. Chair, I want to thank the body for its support of my amendment, 
and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Van Drew amendment.
  This is a good amendment, and I believe it will be helpful, and I 
believe it creates an atmosphere which is a fair atmosphere for 
everyone to increase safety and yet at the same time to understand the 
relationships that do exist in stepfamilies.

  Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the gentleman bringing it, but as 
was said, this is an attempt to make a bill that should have been 
vetted more in committee not be vetted more. And I appreciate that.
  I am not going to oppose the amendment, but when I take it a step 
further, what about the stepparents and the stepsiblings between each 
other, and the stepgrandparents and stepgrandchildren? I have had a 
wonderful look at those families. Those are precious families. Why are 
we just stopping at one?
  Again, it goes back to the heart. And I understand the rush to get 
here, but, again, what makes you feel better and makes you feel good 
does not always heal you. This is something that needs to be addressed.
  Mr. Chair, with this, I am not going to oppose this amendment. It is 
unfortunately very lacking in a bill that is lacking on many points, 
but with that, I yield back the balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-27

not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill 
will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.
  As was just read, the motion to recommit will notify U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, when an illegal alien 
who is prohibited from possessing a firearm attempts to purchase a 
firearm by going through the process of application.


  Madam Speaker, I have been here all afternoon, and we have heard time 
and time again how we have had the problem of mass violence. We have 
talked about how to solve it, and, unfortunately, this underlying bill, 
as I have brought out many times already, will not do this. We have 
heard that we have to do something basically even if it won't work.
  Madam Speaker, I will remind this House one more time that what makes 
you feel good does not always heal you. When we understand that, then 
we can begin to move forward.
  What we have found this day is that this bill has many problems 
because we chose to rush it to the floor because we had a deadline, and 
we cut off debate in committee.
  We found amendments offered to fix parts of this bill that do not fix 
them but actually make them worse.
  We have found out that the authors of the bill did not even know how 
much was going to be fined in the bill until we actually pointed it 
out.
  Now we come to the biggest part: I have been here all day listening 
to: We have to keep criminals from having firearms. We have to keep 
criminals from having firearms.
  I will say it once more, Madam Speaker: We must keep criminals from 
having firearms.
  I am glad to let you know, Madam Speaker, we are now giving everyone 
in this body a chance to do just that.
  A similar measure was promoted. What we are simply saying is that, if 
you have someone who is a criminal who came into our country 
illegally--criminal time number one--if they then try to buy or 
purchase a firearm which they are unable to do, that is the second 
strike as a criminal, and what we are simply saying is, if they do 
that, they will be reported to ICE.
  Now, which Members in this body are opposed to notifying law 
enforcement when a person prohibited from purchasing a firearm attempts 
to do so? Are we against that? No.
  I believe my friends across the aisle are not. I have heard it all 
day: We don't want criminals to have firearms.
  But my question to you now, Madam Speaker, is--be very careful. If 
you vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, you cannot go back to your 
constituency, no matter what is said, and say: I voted to keep illegal 
aliens, those who should not have a firearm, from having a firearm.
  We have heard it all day. And you can moan, you can talk, you can 
think about it, but, again, Madam Speaker, I understand the sympathy 
and the concern and the pain upon this bill, but let's not kid 
ourselves. The bill itself guts itself when it will not even allow a 
registry which the Obama administration said it had.
  Let's actually get back to a point in saying, if there is something 
about this bill, give everybody an opportunity to actually keep a gun 
out of a criminal's hands and actually have that criminal punished for 
that by turning them in.
  But, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, please listen to me right now. 
Hear me clearly. Hear me clearly. No matter what will be said in just a 
moment, no matter what the chairman or anyone else will say about this 
bill, if you vote ``no,'' you are voting to allow someone who should 
not have a firearm to get away with it and not be prosecuted for it.
  Be very clear, Madam Speaker. You can try and make it look better. 
You can try and say: ``Well, it was not part of the bill. I have got to 
have the bill''; but never get away from the fact, Madam Speaker, if 
you vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, you are making a choice to 
say: ``I guess some criminals can get away with trying to get a 
firearm.''
  That is why this motion to recommit needs a ``yes'' vote. This is why 
we on this side stand for making sure that proper firearm safety is 
upheld while our rights are being upheld and, at the same time, looking 
to find real solutions, not perpetrating a fraud on those who are 
scared simply to pass a piece of legislation.
  Madam Speaker, vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit and actually 
keep guns out of criminals' hands.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back balance of my time.",C001093,2019-02-27

1238,BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2242-7,164,Mr. NADLER,"  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, let's remember what we are dealing with. 
We are dealing with the fact that current Federal law with respect to 
firearms background checks is dangerously limited and flawed because 
background checks are only required for sales by licensed gun dealers 
and that many, many people get a gun at a gun show or from someone 
else. Something like 20 percent, I think the figure is, or 25 percent 
of gun sales escape background checks.
  So all kinds of people who may be criminals, who may be mentally ill, 
and who may be domestic abusers who shouldn't have guns get guns, and 
that results in lives forfeited. It results in people killed.
  This bill goes a long way toward solving that by saying we are going 
to require background checks of everyone who gets a gun, with some 
exceptions, with some reasonable exceptions which are in the bill.
  Now, along comes this motion to recommit, which is a total red 
herring having nothing to do with the purpose of the bill, and says 
that, if someone fails a background check because he is illegally in 
this country, you should report that to ICE.

  First of all, if he fails a background check because he is illegally 
in the country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the 
country. It means they already know that.
  So what is the point of reporting him? He has to be in the system as 
illegally in the country in order to fail the background check because 
of section (g)(5). So we already know that, and this is totally 
circular, number one.
  Number two, this is just a red herring to try to mix up the 
immigration issue with the gun violence issue, and they really have 
nothing to do with each other.
  Number three, for 8 years, we couldn't get a hearing--not a hearing 
in a committee--on this bill or on any real bill to stop the plague of 
handgun violence in this country.
  Madam Speaker, 150 people killed in Great Britain, 95 in Austria or 
wherever, 39,000 in the United States--no one will tell me that 
Americans are 10,000 times as mentally ill as Europeans or Japanese. 
The problem is we don't have adequate protections on guns. This bill 
goes in the direction of doing it, and they want to sabotage the bill 
with a phony issue raised by this MTR.
  Now, there is an issue. If people fail the background check for 
various reasons, then you can make a case it should be reported to 
local law enforcement agencies. Mr. Cicilline has a bill to do just 
that. I am going to yield to him in a second. But the fact is it has 
nothing to do with this bill. It is just an attempt to sabotage this 
bill.
  If you believe that we ought to cut down on the plague of gun 
violence in this country, that we ought to save lives, that we ought to 
get rid of all these people who shouldn't have guns having guns, and 
that we ought to have background checks in sensible situations, then 
vote against the motion to recommit and for the bill.
  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
Cicilline).",N000002,2019-02-27

  We are on the precipice of passing the first commonsense gun safety 
bill in this Congress in 25 years. I have been here for 8 years. We 
begged and pleaded and had a sit-in to try to force Republicans to take 
up some measure to reduce gun violence in this country.
  There are women, men, and families all across America who are 
demanding that Congress do something. We are about to do this, and you 
raise a motion to recommit on a phony issue to try to muck this up with 
this gimmick. If you were concerned about reducing gun violence in this 
country and passing commonsense gun safety legislation, you had 8 years 
to bring a bill to the floor.
  But if you are really concerned about this, I have good news for you. 
I have legislation, because, in fact, if someone buys a gun who is a 
prohibited purchaser, whatever their immigration status is, if they 
have committed a crime, then they should be arrested


and prosecuted. Every single Democrat believes that.
  So I have a piece of legislation that says, if that happens, notify 
the field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the local law 
enforcement agency, and the State law enforcement agency, the agencies 
responsible for enforcing the criminal law, so they can arrest and 
prosecute that person.
  I am looking for a Republican colead. I look forward to hearing from 
you.

support of H.R. 1112.
  It has been 1 year since Parkland. It has been 6 years since Sandy 
Hook. It has been 19 years since Columbine. It has been 25 years since 
the Long Island Rail Road massacre, when Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy 
lost her husband and her son was shot in the head. It has been 37 years 
since President Reagan was shot.
  Think of all the suffering that each of these shootings has caused. 
Think of the missing seats at the dinner table and other family events.
  Countless families have been torn apart because of gun violence, 
including that of one of my constituents, Linda Beigel Schulman.
  Linda's son, Scott, was one of the 17 innocent people who lost their 
lives in Parkland that day last year. Scott, a geography teacher and a 
cross-country coach, gave his life protecting his students. Scott died 
heroically while locking the door to his classroom, where students were 
hiding from the approaching gunman.
  Since that date, we have been pushing more and more for commonsense 
gun reform, and H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 are just that.
  Last week, Linda said to me, ``If a universal background check 
prevents just one shooting, it has served its purpose.''
  She inspires me. And I am inspired by my colleagues who are fighting 
for commonsense gun reform, whether they be Democrats or Republicans.

Thompson, a 14 year-old in my district who found a glitch in Apple's 
FaceTime software that allowed iPhones to be turned into spying 
devices. He is a Freshman at Catalina Foothills High School whose 
interest in technology put him in a position to discover this critical 
flaw.
  The flaw Grant discovered allowed a user to be eavesdropped on before 
they actually accepted a call. Before his discovery, I'm sure millions 
of Americans used the app completely unaware of this very serious 
security and privacy violation. But Grant, his sister, and his mom took 
initiative to ensure this vulnerability was addressed, and for that, we 
should all be grateful.
  Grant is a lot like other freshmen--he spends time on Instagram, he 
plays Fortnite, and obviously, he enjoys FaceTiming with his friends. 
He is a humble young man who told me that he and his sister Lauren 
simply stumbled across the flaw. His mother, Michele Thompson, 
supported her son and reached out to Apple so that the flaw could be 
fixed, which Apple promptly did. Michele is rightfully proud of her 
son, and I am too.
  Grant's future is bright. I hear he dreams of one day being involved 
in a STEM-related industry, and I have no doubt that with hard work and 
his natural technology skills his dreams will one day become a reality.
  I thank Grant, Lauren, and Michele for protecting the privacy of 
people around the world. I also want to thank Apple for listening to 
the Thompson family and for rewarding Grant's work with an investment 
in his future. Arizona's 2nd Congressional District is excited to watch 
Grant grow and thrive.

solemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated 
husband, father, community servant, and soldier, LTC (Ret.) Jerry 
``Jay'' White II. Sadly, LTC White passed away on September 20, 2018. A 
funeral service will be held on Wednesday, February 27, 2019, at Old 
Post Chapel at Fort Myer and will be followed by a burial via caisson 
at Arlington National Cemetery.
  LTC White was born on September 23, 1966, to the union of U.S. Army 
Major General (Ret.) Jerry and Linda (Pickens) White in St. Mary's, 
West Virginia. As a member of a military family, LTC White attended 
several schools before graduating from Leilahua High School in Wahiawa, 
Hawaii, and going on the receive a bachelor's degree in Business from 
the University of Hawaii, where he also attended ROTC. He later 
continued his studies and earned a masters degree in International 
Affairs from The Georgia Institute of Technology.
  It has been said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space 
that we occupy here on this earth.'' LTC White paid his rent and he 
paid it well. His distinguished military career officially commenced 
when he entered the Army as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry after 
graduating from the University of Hawaii. Over the course of his 
career, LTC White distinguished himself as a great soldier. After 
graduating from the demanding Airborne, Ranger, and Air Assault 
Courses, he reported for duty at the legendary 101st Airborne Division 
(Air Assault) in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. There he served in the 1/327 
Infantry Battalion, the same unit where his father had served during 
the Vietnam War. He also excelled in leadership positions and was 
awarded the Bronze Star and Combat Infantryman's Badge for his service 
during the First Gulf War. His later assignments included duty at Fort 
Lewis, Washington; Paris, France, and Brussels, Belgium, where he 
trained as an Army European Foreign Area Officer; and Washington, D.C., 
where he served as a liaison officer for United States Southern Command 
and later as an advisor to the Washington, D.C. National Guard.
  Even after honorably serving his country, he continued to give of 
himself in service to his community. As an avid Washington, D.C. sports 
fan, he enjoyed attending Redskins and Nationals games as well as 
working with youth by volunteering as the Braddock Road Youth Club 
softball commissioner and a team coach for many years.
  LTC White achieved much in his life but none of it would have been 
possible without the love and support of his loving parents, Jerry and 
Linda; his wife Jennifer; his children, Juliana and Jameson; and a host 
of family and friends that will miss him deeply.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife, Vivian; and 
the more than 730,000 constituents of the Second Congressional District 
in recognizing LTC (Ret.) Jerry ``Jay'' White II for his dedicated 
service to our country and his community and in extending our 
condolences to his family and friends. May they be consoled and 
comforted by their abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks 
and months ahead.

Macedonian Caucus and representative of one of the largest populations 
of Macedonian-Americans in the country, I would like to include in the 
Record the following article from the BBC entitled ``Greece's invisible 
minority--the Macedonian Slavs''. I'm dedicated to maintaining and 
strengthening a positive and mutually beneficial relationship between 
the United States and Macedonia, and urge my colleagues to join me in 
building and enhancing the cultural, economic, strategic, and 
governmental ties between our two nations.

               [From the BBC News Stories, Feb. 24, 2019]

         ``Greece's Invisible Minority--the Macedonian Slavs''

       By ratifying an agreement with the newly renamed Republic 
     of North Macedonia, Greece has implicitly recognised the 
     existence of a Macedonian language and ethnicity. And yet it 
     has denied the existence of its own Macedonian minority for 
     decades, says Maria Margaronis. Will something now change?
       Mr. Fokas, 92, stands straight as a spear in his tan 
     leather brogues and cream blazer, barely leaning on the ebony 
     and ivory cane brought from Romania by his grandfather a 
     century ago. His mind and his memory are as sharp as his 
     outfit.
       A retired lawyer, Mr. Fokas speaks impeccable formal Greek 
     with a distinctive lilt: his mother tongue is Macedonian, a 
     Slavic language related to Bulgarian and spoken in this part 
     of the Balkans for centuries. At his son's modern house in a 
     village in northern Greece, he takes me through the painful 
     history of Greece's unrecognised Slavic-speaking minority.
       Mr. Fokas takes care to emphasise from the start that he is 
     both an ethnic Macedonian and a Greek patriot. He has good 
     reason


     to underline his loyalty: for almost a century, ethnic 
     Macedonians in Greece have been objects of suspicion and, at 
     times, persecution, even as their presence has been denied by 
     almost everyone. Most are reluctant to speak to outsiders 
     about their identity. To themselves and others, they're known 
     simply as ``locals'' (dopyi), who speak a language called 
     ``local'' (dopya). They are entirely absent from school 
     history textbooks, have not featured in censuses since 1951 
     (when they were only patchily recorded, and referred to 
     simply as ``Slavic-speakers''), and are barely mentioned in 
     public. Most Greeks don't even know that they exist.
       That erasure was one reason for Greece's long-running 
     dispute with the former Yugoslav republic now officially 
     called the Republic of North Macedonia. The dispute was 
     finally resolved last month by a vote in the Greek parliament 
     ratifying (by a majority of just seven) an agreement made 
     last June by the countries' two prime ministers. When the 
     Greek Prime Minster, Alexis Tsipras, referred during the 
     parliamentary debate to the existence of ``Slavomacedonians'' 
     in Greece--at the time of World War Two--he was breaking a 
     long-standing taboo.
       The use of the name ``Macedonia'' by the neighbouring 
     nation state implicitly acknowledges that Macedonians are a 
     people in their own right, and opens the door to hard 
     questions about the history of Greece's own Macedonian 
     minority.
       When Mr. Fokas was born, the northern Greek region of 
     Macedonia had only recently been annexed by the Greek state. 
     Until 1913 it was part of the Ottoman Empire, with Greece, 
     Bulgaria and Serbia all wooing its Slavic-speaking 
     inhabitants as a means to claiming the territory. It was 
     partly in reaction to those competing forces that a 
     distinctive Slav Macedonian identity emerged in the late 19th 
     and early 20th Century. As Mr. Fokas's uncle used to say, the 
     family was ``neither Serb, nor Greek, nor Bulgarian, but 
     Macedonian Orthodox''.
       In the end, the Slav Macedonians found themselves divided 
     between those three new states. In Greece, some were 
     expelled; those who remained were pushed to assimilate. All 
     villages and towns with non-Greek names were given new ones, 
     chosen by a committee of scholars in the late 1920s, though 
     almost a century later some ``locals'' still use the old 
     ones.
       In 1936, when Mr. Fokas was nine years old, the Greek 
     dictator Ioannis Metaxas (an admirer of Mussolini) banned the 
     Macedonian language, and forced Macedonian-speakers to change 
     their names to Greek ones. Mr. Fokas remembers policemen 
     eavesdropping on mourners at funerals and listening at 
     windows to catch anyone speaking or singing in the forbidden 
     tongue. There were lawsuits, threats and beatings.
       Women--who often spoke no Greek--would cover their mouths 
     with their headscarves to muffle their speech, but Mr. 
     Fokas's mother was arrested and fined 250 drachmas, a big sum 
     back then.
       ``Slavic-speakers suffered a lot from the Greeks under 
     Metaxas,'' he says. ``Twenty people from this village, the 
     heads of the big families, were exiled to the island of 
     Chios. My father-in-law was one of them.'' They were tortured 
     by being forced to drink castor oil, a powerful laxative.
       When Germany, Italy and Bulgaria invaded Greece in 1941, 
     some Slavic-speakers welcomed the Bulgarians as potential 
     liberators from Metaxas's repressive regime. But many soon 
     joined the resistance, led by the Communist Party (which at 
     that time supported the Macedonian minority) and continued 
     fighting with the Communists in the civil war that followed 
     the Axis occupation. (Bulgaria annexed the eastern part of 
     Greek Macedonia from 1941 to 1944, committing many 
     atrocities; many Greeks wrongly attribute these to 
     Macedonians, whom they identify as Bulgarians.)
       When the Communists were finally defeated, severe reprisals 
     followed for anyone associated with the resistance or the 
     left.
       ``Macedonians paid more than anyone for the civil war,'' 
     Mr. Fokas says. ``Eight people were court-martialled and 
     executed from this village, eight from the next village, 23 
     from the one opposite. They killed a grandfather and his 
     grandson, just 18 years old.''
       Mr. Fokas was a student in Thessaloniki then--but he too 
     was arrested and spent three years on the prison island of 
     Makronisos, not because of anything he'd done but because his 
     mother had helped her brother-in-law escape through the 
     skylight of a cafe where he was being held.
       Most of the prisoners on Makronisos were Greek leftists, 
     and were pressed to sign declarations of repentance for their 
     alleged Communist past. Those who refused were made to crawl 
     under barbed wire, or beaten with thick bamboo canes. 
     ``Terrible things were done,'' Mr. Fokas says. ``But we 
     mustn't talk about them. It's an insult to Greek 
     civilisation. It harms Greece's good name.''
       Tens of thousands of fighters with the Democratic Army, 
     about half of them Slavic-speakers, went into exile in 
     Eastern bloc countries during and after the civil war. About 
     20,000 children were taken across the border by the 
     Communists, whether for their protection or as reserve troops 
     for a future counter-attack.
       Many Slavic-speaking civilians also went north for safety. 
     Entire villages were left empty, like the old settlement of 
     Krystallopigi (Smrdes in Macedonian) near the Albanian 
     border, where only the imposing church of St. George stands 
     witness to a population that once numbered more than 1,500 
     souls.
       In 1982, more than 30 years after the conflict's end, 
     Greece's socialist government issued a decree allowing civil 
     war refugees to return--but only those who were ``of Greek 
     ethnicity''. Ethnic Macedonians from Greece remained shut out 
     of their country, their villages and their land; families 
     separated by the war were never reunited.
       Mr. Fokas's father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in 
     Skopje. But, he points out, that decree tacitly recognised 
     that there were ethnic Macedonians in Greece, even though the 
     state never officially recognised their existence: ``Those 
     war refugees left children, grandchildren, fathers, mothers 
     behind. What were they, if not Macedonians?''
       It's impossible accurately to calculate the number of 
     Slavic-speakers or descendants of ethnic Macedonians in 
     Greece. Historian Leonidas Embiricos estimates that more than 
     100,000 still live in the Greek region of Macedonia, though 
     only 10,000 to 20,000 would identify openly as members of a 
     minority--and many others are proud Greek nationalists.
       The Macedonian language hasn't officially been banned in 
     Greece for decades, but the fear still lingers. A middle-aged 
     man I met in a village near the reed beds of Lake Prespa, 
     where the agreement between Greece and the North Macedonian 
     republic was first signed last June, explained that this fear 
     is passed down through the generations. ``My parents didn't 
     speak the language at home in case I picked it up and spoke 
     it in public. To protect me. We don't even remember why we're 
     afraid any more,'' he said. Slowly the language is dying. 
     Years of repression pushed it indoors; assimilation is 
     finishing the job.
       And yet speaking or singing in Macedonian can still be 
     cause for harassment. Mr. Fokas' son is a musician; he plays 
     the haunting Macedonian flute for us as his own small son 
     looks on. He and a group of friends used to host an 
     international music festival in the village square, with 
     bands from as far away as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.
       ``After those bands had played we'd have a party and play 
     Macedonian songs,'' he says. ``None of them were nationalist 
     or separatist songs--we would never allow that. But in 2008, 
     just as we were expecting the foreign musicians to arrive, 
     the local authority suddenly banned us from holding the 
     festival in the square, even though other people--the very 
     ones who wanted us banned--still hold their own events 
     there.''
       At the last minute, the festival was moved to a field 
     outside the village, among the reeds and marshes, without 
     proper facilities--which, Mr. Fokas's son points out, only 
     made Greece look bad.
       ``And do you know why the songs are banned in the square 
     but not the fields outside?'' his father adds. ``Because 
     around the square there are cafes, and local people could sit 
     there and watch and listen secretly. But outside the village 
     they were afraid to join in--they would have drawn attention 
     to themselves by doing that.''
       The ratification of Greece's agreement with the Republic of 
     North Macedonia--and its implicit recognition of a Macedonian 
     language and ethnicity--is a major political breakthrough 
     which should help to alleviate such fears. But the process 
     has also sparked new waves of anger and anxiety, with large, 
     sometimes violent protests opposing the agreement, supported 
     by parts of the Orthodox church.
       An election is due before the end of the year. Greece's 
     right-wing opposition has been quick to capitalise on 
     nationalist sentiments, accusing the Syriza government of 
     treason and betrayal. For Greece's Slavic-speakers, who have 
     long sought nothing more than the right to cultural 
     expression, the time to emerge from the shadows may not quite 
     yet have arrived.
       Mr. Fokas has been referred to by his first name to protect 
     his identity.

1263,HONORING VICTIMS OF SUMGAIT POGROM,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE223,0,Mr. SCHIFF,"  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 31st anniversary 
of the pogrom against the Armenian residents of the town of Sumgait, 
Azerbaijan. On February 27, 1988, and for three days following, 
Azerbaijani mobs assaulted and killed Armenians. The violence left 
hundreds of Armenian civilians dead and injured, women and girls were 
raped, and some victims were burned alive. Thousands were forced to 
flee their homes, leaving behind their belongings.
   The pogroms came as a direct result of years of vicious, racist 
anti-Armenian propaganda by Azerbaijani authorities, dehumanizing the 
Armenian residents of Azerbaijan and laying the groundwork for mass 
violence. Azerbaijani authorities made little effort to punish those 
responsible, instead attempting to cover up the atrocities in Sumgait 
to this day and denying the government role in instigating the 
killings. Indeed, even today, racist propaganda against Armenia and 
Armenians is prevalent in Azerbaijan.
   The hateful and dangerous Azerbaijani attacks on Armenians is also 
seen in a horrific crime which occurred 15 years ago last week. At a 
NATO sponsored training in Budapest, an Azerbaijani Army officer named 
Ramil Safarov snuck into the room of an Armenian lieutenant, Gurgen 
Margaryan, and hacked him to death with an axe as he slept.
   For this brutal and despicable crime, Safarov was sentenced to life 
imprisonment in Hungary. Yet after a determined campaign by 
Azerbaijan's government, he was extradited to Baku in 2012 where he was 
greeted not as a criminal but as a hero, provided back pay, and 
promoted in rank. There is no more dramatic illustration of 
Azerbaijan's continued posture of hatred and aggression towards their 
Armenian neighbor than their celebration of a cold-blooded murderer.
   The assault on ethnic Armenian civilians in Sumgait helped touch off 
what would become a direct conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
which took thousands of lives and dislocated millions more. The 
anniversary of Sumgait is a reminder of the consequences when 
aggression and hatred grow unchecked.
   Madam Speaker, in two months we will mark the 104th Anniversary of 
the Armenian Genocide, an event the Turkish government, Azerbaijan's 
closest ally, goes to great lengths to deny. We must not let such 
crimes against humanity go unrecognized, whether they occurred 
yesterday or 30 years ago or 100 years ago. Today, let us pause to 
remember the victims of the atrocities of the Sumgait pogroms. Madam 
Speaker, it is our moral obligation to condemn crimes of hatred and to 
remember the victims, in hope that history will not be repeated.

1264,CLARA LUPER,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE216-5,0,Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma,"  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
highlight the visionary and unwavering leadership of Civil Rights icon 
and notable Oklahoman, Ms. Clara Luper. Six months ago, I got to 
witness history, as Oklahoma City commemorated the 60th anniversary of 
the sit-ins she organized. And even as a 5th generation Oklahoman, I 
realized how little I knew.
  Clara Luper and her students sparked a movement: the sit-ins that led 
into our nation's civil rights movement. They deserve to be a household 
name.
  Clara Luper made her mark in a time where people of color couldn't 
even walk into the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They were 
relegated to hidden back doors. But she had a vision for equality, a 
heart for service, and a commitment to justice. She, in her words, 
``believed in a sun when it didn't shine, and the rain when it didn't 
fall.'' She knew that Oklahoma and this country could be a place where 
everyone is treated with respect, dignity, and humanity.


  As a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer Oklahoma, she 
instilled those principles into her students. Her steadfast commitment 
to ending racism and systemic discrimination inspired her to organize 
America's first sit in.
  In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP walked up to a lunch counter 
they knew would refuse them, and they ordered a hamburger and a Coke. 
They were denied, but they did not waver. They knew what was on the 
line. In Ms. Luper's words, ``within that hamburger was the whole 
essence of democracy.''
  At their own personal peril, they returned each day with more people 
until they broke the barrier. It was never easy. The protestors were 
verbally and physically assaulted. Ms. Luper received death threats.
  Because of Ms. Luper and her students' fearlessness and 
determination, Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters not 
just in Oklahoma City, but in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa too. When the 
1958 sit-in happened in Oklahoma City, a group of college students were 
inspired by what had taken place in Oklahoma City and took note. So in 
1961 the students launched the Greensboro, N.C. sit-in at the Woolworth 
lunch counter--which fueled momentum within the civil rights movement.
  It didn't end there. For years, Ms. Luper and others continued their 
fight. The sacrifices continued too. Authorities arrested Luper 26 
times during her fight for freedom.
  Clara Luper empowered young people to imagine a future brighter than 
their present and taught them how to make that future a reality. She 
changed lives and planted seeds of ethical leadership into those who 
were lucky to be mentored by her. Each of her former students talks 
about the pivotal role Ms. Luper played in instilling confidence, 
character, and dignity in them.
  Generations reap the benefits of her sacrifice and the efforts to 
integrate not only businesses in Oklahoma City, but educational spaces. 
Ms. Luper integrated the History department at the University of 
Oklahoma, becoming the first Black graduate of that Master's program.
  Her contributions are reflected across our state: in a namesake 
scholarship program at Oklahoma City University, a Corridor on the 
northeast side of Oklahoma City, a classroom at the University of 
Central Oklahoma, designating the Oklahoma City Public Schools District 
building as the Clara Luper Center, and naming the African American 
studies department at the University of Oklahoma after her.
  As a lifelong Oklahoman, the representative of the fifth 
Congressional District, and as an American, I recognize how we are 
beneficiaries of Clara Luper's efforts to create a more just and 
equitable place to live. I cannot and will not take that history and 
her impact for granted.
  Although we've come so far because of her sacrifices and the 
sacrifices of other heroes during the Civil Rights Era, there's still 
so much work left to do. Even with the numerous accolades given to her, 
the best way that we can honor Ms. Clara Luper is to uphold her legacy 
through a commitment to justice and equality in the policies that we 
propose. She knew that democracy isn't a spectator sport. It is our 
duty as a Congress and as Americans to make good on the constitutional 
promise of establishing justice and ensuring domestic tranquility. So 
we must continue to work for an inclusive, equitable place for everyone 
to live and feel safe as well as build an economy where every American 
has the opportunity to thrive. I thank the sit-inners and I thank Clara 
Luper, for their resilience and giving us the torch to carry.

1265,FEBRUARY IS NATIONAL CHILDREN'S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE222-4,0,Ms. KELLY of Illinois,"  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, February is National Children's 
Dental Health month--an opportunity that brings together thousands of 
dedicated professionals, healthcare providers, and educators to promote 
the benefits of good oral health to children, their caregivers, 
teachers and many others.
  Each year, millions of Americans suffer from untreated dental 
disease. Tooth decay remains the most common, chronic childhood 
disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
about 20 percent of children ages 5 to 11 suffer from tooth decay, 
despite the fact that it is a completely preventable disease. Children 
from low-income families are twice as likely to have cavities compared 
to children from higher-income households.
  Give Kids A Smile (GKAS), sponsored by the Foundation of the American 
Dental Association, is an annual centerpiece during National Children's 
Dental Health Month. Give Kids a Smile Day is one of the most important 
events for children and dentists in this country. Thousands of dentists 
and volunteers give their time to provide free oral health education, 
screenings, and treatment to underserved children. Since 2003, more 
than 5.5 million children have been cared for by more than half a 
million volunteers. Programs like this will continue throughout the 
year.
  I'm happy to have led the passage of legislation that supports 
programs such as Give Kids A Smile and other initiatives aimed at 
providing greater access to care. The Action for Dental Health Act 
supports a nationwide, community-based movement focused on delivering 
care now to people suffering from dental disease, strengthening and 
growing the public and private safety net to provide more care to more 
Americans, and expanding dental health education and disease prevention 
within underserved communities.
  Ensuring that children and adults receive accessible, quality oral 
health care should remain a priority for all of us. Thank you for 
supporting dentistry and the oral health of our nation's most 
vulnerable population.

Protection Agency.",,2019-02-27

1268,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,2,Mr. CARPER,"  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the 
nomination of Andrew Wheeler to become Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
  The day after Mr. Wheeler was named EPA Acting Administrator, I wrote 
him a letter. I reminded Mr. Wheeler of the opportunity he had to try a 
new course for that Agency after Scott Pruitt's scandal-plagued 
administration. Yet in the 7 months as Acting Administrator, 
unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler has so far chosen not to reverse course at 
EPA in too many important instances. In some cases, he has even 
accelerated the environmental damage and regulatory zeal that his 
predecessor began.
  I knew that Mr. Wheeler and I would not always agree on every issue, 
but like so many others, I did hope that he would moderate some of 
Scott Pruitt's most egregious and environmentally destructive policies, 
specifically on policies where industry and the environmental community 
are in broad agreement. Sadly, my hopes have not been realized.
  To be clear, Mr. Wheeler is not the ethically bereft embarrassment 
that Scott Pruitt was. Mr. Wheeler has also engaged more frequently and 
substantively than Scott Pruitt did with both Congress and EPA career 
staff, but time and again, Mr. Wheeler has proven that his 
environmental policies are almost as destructive and extreme as his 
predecessor's, despite the explicit promises Mr. Wheeler has made to 
Members of Congress, both in private and in public meetings.
  One of those promises was Mr. Wheeler's recent insistence that, when 
it comes to getting a deal on vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas 
standards with California and a coalition of 12 other States, including 
my State and the Presiding Officer's State, ``no one wants a 50-State 
deal more than I do.'' That was Mr. Wheeler's promise during his 
nomination hearing in front of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee in January.
  Just weeks later, the headlines told a different story. For months, 
Mr. Wheeler said repeatedly that he shared my goal of striking a deal--
not just my goal, but the goal of many of us here--with the State of 
California and a dozen of other States on fuel economy and greenhouse 
gas emissions standards. Not long after he became Acting Administrator, 
however, Mr. Wheeler signed off on the Trump administration's proposal 
that freezes the standards for the better part of a decade, eliminates 
most of the air conditioning, electric vehicle, and other compliance 
credits that are supported by chemical companies, automobile and parts 
manufacturers, and utilities and preempts California's authority to set 
its own stronger standards.
  What is more, the Trump administration reportedly plans to penalize 
rules that call for a 0.5-percent increase. That is a one-half of 1-
percent increase in the stringency of those standards--one-tenth the 
pace called for in the rules that are already on the books.
  Since that proposal was put forth, the entire automobile industry, 
many Members of Congress, and many other stakeholders have repeatedly 
asked the EPA to forge a compromise that avoids years of costly 
litigation and uncertainty for our automobile industry. So far, that is 
all for naught.
  Just last week, unfortunately and inexplicably, EPA announced, with 
the


White House and the Department of Transportation, that they decided to 
end their so-called negotiations with the State of California and, 
effectively, with 12 other States. These negotiations were superficial, 
at best, or duplicitous and designed to fail, at worst. Between you and 
me, I don't see how these discussions could have ended or failed 
because they never seriously began in the first place. It is 
outrageous.
  That brings me back to Mr. Wheeler's promise. After his emphatic 
insistence that he wanted to find a 50-State solution for these 
standards, the decision to end them without ever making a serious 
effort to ever reach a compromise sends a clear message that, sadly, 
Mr. Wheeler--at least, in this instance--is unable to keep his word. I 
say that with no joy, but I say it nonetheless.
  A second example of Mr. Wheeler's failure to lead in an appropriate 
way lies in his unreasonable opposition to submitting to the Senate for 
ratification something called a the ``Kigali Amendment'' to the 
Montreal Protocol.
  I mentioned this to one of our colleagues. He said: Talk to me in 
English.
  I reminded him that we used to use something called CFCs. It was a 
refrigerator coolant that was broadly used in this country until we 
found out it had very serious consequences for our ozone layer. 
Science, chemical companies, and chemists came up with a replacement to 
CFCs. We call them HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, which are better for 
the ozone. They are still destructive to the greenhouse gas and 
destructive to our planet. Well, guess what. Scientists and chemists 
have, again, come up with a follow-on product to HFCs. It is not 
scientists and chemists in companies in other countries. They are right 
here in America. They have invested in a lot of money to come up with 
this discovery, this invention. They want to sell it. That requires the 
phaseout over time of HFCs.
  We need the Kigali Amendment to be submitted to the Senate for 
ratification in order to open the door for our American companies to 
compete with a new technology that is good for jobs in America and good 
for our planet. Our country could gain 150,000 direct and indirect new 
jobs, and almost $40 billion in annual economic benefits by 2027 
because the safer substitutes to HFCs are made in Texas and Louisiana. 
These are good-paying jobs. These are green manufacturing jobs that 
could help our efforts to address climate change while bolstering our 
country's economy.
  Ratification of this treaty is supported by an extraordinary list of 
stakeholders, including more than a dozen of our Republican colleagues 
here in this Chamber. From the American Chemistry Council to the 
Chamber of Commerce, to FreedomWorks, to the Sierra Club, it seems that 
just about everyone supports ratification of this amendment, as best I 
can tell--everyone, that is, except EPA.
  Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, EPA also decided it is no longer 
``appropriate and necessary'' to protect babies' brains from mercury 
and air toxic pollution emitted by electric utilities.
  In the eleventh hour before the government shutdown, Mr. Wheeler 
signed a proposal that guts the legal foundation of the mercury and air 
toxics standards, also known as the MATS rule. Using outdated data and 
deciding that some benefits--like reduction in cancer, birth defects, 
and asthma attacks--are no longer important for the Agency to count, 
EPA is now setting a dangerous precedent and putting the mercury and 
air toxics standards rule in legal jeopardy. In fact, EPA has gone so 
far as to request public comment on whether the standards should be 
eliminated altogether.
  Mr. Wheeler says that this action was necessary and that the proposal 
strikes a balance. That is just not true. In fact, the utility industry 
is in full compliance with these standards already, and they have done 
so at a third of the expected costs. That is why every stakeholder--
from coal-fired utilities that comply with the rules to religious 
leaders, to environmental organizations, to the Chamber of Commerce--
urged this administration not to take this step. In fact, utility 
groups and organized labor organizations wrote to EPA saying:

       The industry already has invested significant capital--
     estimated at more than $18 billion--in addition to these 
     operating costs, and states are relying on the operation of 
     these controls for their air quality plans. Therefore, we--

  This being the group that wrote to EPA, including utility groups and 
organized labor groups--

     urge EPA to . . . leave the underlying MATS rule in place and 
     effective.

  Yet Mr. Wheeler has chosen to ignore the chorus of stakeholders who 
all hoped he would chart a more responsible path--on this front, too--
even though utilities are not asking for this action that he is taking 
and the EPA is taking, and the courts are not requiring it.
  Yet, from the stakeholders, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the 
utility industry over here to all of the NGOs and environmental groups 
and health groups over here, everybody says to leave this rule alone. 
It was adopted 7 years ago, and it works. It has worked at half the 
cost or at one-third of the cost. Leave it alone. I just don't get 
this. This is just another example of when Mr. Wheeler has taken a 
recklessly and unnecessary extreme course of action at the EPA.
  Here is another one.
  In May of 2018, after meeting with a victim's mother, Scott Pruitt, 
the former EPA Administrator, announced plans to finalize the Obama 
administration's ban to prohibit consumer and commercial paint 
stripping uses for something called methylene chloride--a hazardous 
chemical that has killed dozens of unsuspecting users in this country 
alone.
  Despite explicit assurances provided to my office and others that the 
EPA would follow through with Mr. Pruitt's promise to protect both 
consumer and commercial users from methylene chloride, under Mr. 
Wheeler's leadership, the EPA sent a final rule restricting only the 
consumer uses of methylene chloride to the White House's Office of 
Management and Budget. There have been 56 accidental exposure deaths 
related to methylene chloride since 1980--56--including properly 
trained workers who have worn protective gear on the job. Yet the EPA, 
under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, has decided to exempt workers from the 
methylene chloride ban.
  A number of people have said to me they think it is unconscionable. I 
think they are right. With Mr. Wheeler at the helm, the EPA cannot even 
manage to ban a chemical that is so harmful to human health that 
stores--and this includes Walmart, Sherwin-Williams, Ace Hardware, Home 
Depot, and others--have already voluntarily taken it off their shelves.
  That is not all. Even the EPA's recently announced PFAS Action Plan, 
which was released with much fanfare 2 weeks ago, did not do much more 
than renounce the same measures announced by Scott Pruitt almost a year 
ago. PFAS is sometimes referred to as forever chemicals. The reason, my 
colleagues, is that they last forever in our environment. It took a 
public outcry to make Mr. Wheeler reverse the Agency's inexplicable 
decision not to set an enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS. At 
his hearing last month, I asked him if he would agree to set a clean 
drinking water standard in 2 years--not in 2 weeks, not in 2 months but 
in 2 years--and he could not do that.
  In short, over the past 7 months as the Acting Administrator, Mr. 
Wheeler has perpetuated and in at least one instance I have cited here 
today has worsened the preexisting inadequacies and failures Scott 
Pruitt left behind. When faced with opportunities to protect human 
health and the environment in ways that also have the support of the 
industries that would be regulated, time and again, Mr. Wheeler has 
failed to act in a way that I believe is responsible and has, instead, 
listened to some of the most extreme voices around him.
  As I have said before and will say again, I am not making some futile 
attempt at changing the hearts and minds about this nominee at the 
eleventh hour. I am not that kind of Senator and never have been, and I 
was not that kind of Governor. I am not grandstanding, trying to get 
any press attention, or the perfect sound bite. I am, however, trying 
to convince some of my colleagues to seize this window of opportunity 
we have now to ensure that Acting Administrator Wheeler reverses course 
and governs responsibly


at the EPA. That is what I am trying to do. That is what we are trying 
to do.
  As the President's nominee to lead this Agency, under the provisions 
of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Wheeler can continue to lead 
the EPA as Acting Administrator until August 7 of this year. He is 
there, and he is going to be there. Rushing to judgment on this 
nomination will close the window of opportunity we have to ensure the 
Acting Administrator reverses course at the EPA and embraces the 
commonsense, bipartisan policies I just laid out--policies which make 
our environment cleaner and safer while they also create jobs and 
strengthen America's economy. I think we all want that. I think that is 
why people sent us here to negotiate those kind of win-win agreements.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this nomination so we 
can achieve those win-win situations that are there for the taking.
  I thank the Presiding Officer.

1270,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,4,Mr. BARRASSO,"  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the 
nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. It is the job of the EPA to protect 
both the environment and human health. This critically important Agency 
needs Senate-confirmed leadership in place.
  President Trump picked the right person to lead this Agency when he 
nominated Andrew Wheeler. Since April of last year, he has served as 
the Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and 
since July of last year, he has served as the Acting Administrator of 
the Agency. I believe Andrew Wheeler has done an outstanding job in 
leading the EPA over the past 7 months.
  During the last administration, the EPA issued punishing regulations 
that would hurt the economy and raise costs on families. Under Acting 
Administrator Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has taken a different 
approach. The Agency is now putting forward proposals that both protect 
our environment and allow the country's economy to flourish.
  Acting Administrator Wheeler has led efforts to issue commonsense 
regulatory proposals. These include the affordable clean energy rule 
and revising the definition of the waters of the United States. Both of 
these proposals show Mr. Wheeler is serious about clean air and clean 
water while they also show he understands there is an important role 
for States and local communities to play. It can't be a top-down, 
Washington-knows-best approach.
  Acting Administrator Wheeler has played a critical role in 
implementing updates to the Toxic Substances Control Act and has taken 
steps to limit people's exposure to dangerous and toxic chemicals. 
These updates are the result of major bipartisan legislation that came 
out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2016.
  Andrew Wheeler is working to limit lead exposure as well. Last 
December, he helped to unveil the Trump administration's multiagency 
effort to reduce the number of children exposed to lead in drinking 
water, in consumer products, and in paint. During his tenure, the EPA 
has also worked to provide greater regulatory certainty to States, to 
Tribes, to communities, and to the industries it regulates.
  Mr. Wheeler is well qualified for the position of EPA Administrator. 
He has spent decades--actually, over 25 years--working in environmental 
policy. He has served as a career employee at the EPA as an 
environmental protection specialist. This experience makes him uniquely 
qualified to serve as the head of the Agency.
  After that time, he spent over a decade here on Capitol Hill. When he 
left the EPA, he came here to work on the Environment and Public Works 
Committee. He served as the staff director of the Senate Environment 
and Public Works' Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee for 6 
years. Then he spent another 6 years working as the Republican staff 
director and chief counsel for the full committee under Chairman Jim 
Inhofe. After his time on the Hill, he also worked as a consultant for 
a variety of energy and environmental clients. He is very well 
qualified, and that is a big reason his nomination has received broad 
support.
  There are 63 agricultural and forestry groups that wrote a letter in 
support of Mr. Wheeler's nomination to be the Administrator: ``It is 
hard to imagine a more qualified individual for the role of EPA 
administrator, and we respectfully request that the committee move to 
confirm his nomination so that he may be considered by the full 
Senate,'' they say, ``at the earliest date possible.''
  Mr. Wheeler has received praise from the United Mine Workers of 
America.
  Cecil Roberts, the union's international president, said the 
following about Mr. Wheeler: ``[H]e will be a reasonable voice within 
the agency, and will recognize the impact on both the workers and 
mining communities that are directly affected as EPA develops future 
emissions regulations.''
  His experience and commitment to sound environmental policies has 
received recognition from the Democrats as well.
  Senator Carper, who is with me on the floor and was the ranking 
member of our committee at one point, said of Mr. Wheeler when he was 
nominated for the Deputy Administrator's role: ``I think having worked 
in the agency, he actually cares about the environment; the air we 
breathe; the water we drink; the planet on which we live.'' I agree.
  It is time to end the needless delays by the Senate Democrats. Andrew 
Wheeler's nomination to serve as the Deputy Administrator was delayed 
for months and had to be reported out of the EPW Committee twice before 
he was confirmed. Now the Senate Democrats are calling to delay the 
process again. These delays only slow down the Agency from meeting its 
objectives of helping communities and protecting the environment.
  The EPA needs a Senate-confirmed Administrator in office. The EPA 
Administrator plays a central role in developing and implementing 
programs that are focused on meeting the EPA's mission of protecting 
human health and the environment. Andrew Wheeler is well qualified to 
lead this Agency and to serve in the President's Cabinet. He is the 
right person to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, and I strongly encourage every Senator to support the 
nomination.


                      Nomination of John L. Ryder

  Mr. President, I also rise in support of the nomination of John L. 
Ryder to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee 
Valley Authority, the TVA.
  The TVA serves 9 million people in parts of seven Southeastern 
States. It provides affordable electricity for business customers and 
local power companies, for flood control, navigation, and land 
management for the Tennessee River system, plus economic development 
for the region. The TVA is credited with transforming the region into a 
growing population and a growing economic base.
  With over 40 years of experience as a lawyer, Mr. Ryder will be a 
strong complement to the TVA's Board of Directors. The Environment and 
Public Works Committee attested to this fact when it reported his 
nomination favorably to the Senate by a voice vote twice--first, on May 
22, 2018, during the 115th Congress, and the next on February 5 of this 
year after he had to be renominated during this Congress because of the 
delays in the nomination approval process last year. Mr. Ryder is 
another example of how the confirmation process has deliberately run 
aground. Mr. Ryder, in normal times, would have been confirmed and in 
office last summer. Instead, we have to go through a cloture vote on a 
well-qualified nominee who has twice been reported unanimously through 
the Environment and Public Works Committee.
  Let's not delay this any longer. I urge my colleagues to vote with me 
in supporting the nomination of John L. Ryder to be a member of the 
Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
  I thank the Presiding Officer.

                   Bipartisan Background Checks Bill
",,2019-02-27
1272,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,6,Mr. MURPHY,"  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, later today, the House of Representatives 
will pass a proposal that will be supported by 95, 97 percent of 
Americans.


This is a proposal to make sure anybody in this country who wants to 
buy a gun in a legitimate transaction has to go through a background 
check--a background check that in 90 percent of the cases takes less 
than 5 minutes of time. That background check will assure that only 
people who should be buying guns and owning guns will be buying and 
owning guns--people who don't have violent criminal histories and 
people who don't have histories of serious mental illness. It is a 
popular proposal. It is an impactful proposal. It will save thousands 
of lives all across this country.
  I have come down to the floor to just remind my colleagues as to why 
this is so important, and I want to tell a quick story to try to put a 
little meat on the bone when it comes to this conversation we are 
having about the importance of making sure people go through background 
checks before they buy weapons.
  Mr. President, 2008 to 2012 was a period of time in this country's 
history where violence was declining. Homicides were declining. Gun 
murders were declining. They were declining across the country. 
Specifically during that period of time, they were declining in the 
Midwest. Yet there was one State that stood out as a curious outlier 
during that period of time, and that was the State of Missouri.
  In the State of Missouri, there was a dramatic jump during this 
period of time in gun homicides. In fact, it happened right away after 
2007. In 2008 and 2009, about 50 to 60 to 70 additional people every 
year were being murdered with guns inside Missouri. A researcher from 
Johns Hopkins went to try to figure out why this was, and I think it is 
important to tell that story on the floor today.
  Let me give a little historical context first. During the Civil War, 
Missouri was one of the most violent, most dangerous places in the 
country because there were these outlaws, these renegades of 
Confederates who were out in the bush--they call them the 
bushwhackers--who were doing regular battle with Union troops. It was 
one of the first instances of true, sustained guerilla warfare in this 
Nation. When the Civil War was over, they didn't go home. They had been 
brutally put down by the Union, but they stuck, and they formed their 
own smaller criminal enterprises.
  We know about this because Jesse James and his brother Frank were 
amongst those who made their name as bushwhackers fighting the Union 
and then turned into criminals who robbed stage coaches and banks and 
trains.
  To combat this post-Civil War continuation of violence, Missouri 
decided to change its firearms laws, and it started with a crackdown on 
the ability of individuals to conceal weapons. It extended to a change 
in the Constitution to make it perfectly clear that Missouri 
politicians had the ability to limit who could own guns and who 
couldn't.
  Eventually, a provision got passed that said that in order to own a 
handgun, you had to get a permit from your local authority. As time 
went on, that permit came to include a background check, so that if you 
wanted to own a gun in Missouri, you had to go and get a background 
check. You had to prove you did not have a serious criminal history or 
a serious history of mental illness.
  What happened in 2007 was that, very quietly, that provision got 
repealed. It was part of a much louder effort to repeal a whole host of 
gun laws in Missouri. Missouri kind of became the epicenter of the 
NRA's focus in the 2000s. It was this Southern--semi-Southern State 
that still had pretty tough gun laws, and the NRA went all in and had 
their annual convention in St. Louis and spent millions of dollars 
trying to elect folks who would sign laws they were pushing through the 
legislature. In 2007, they finally got their way. They got all these 
laws that had been passed since the Civil War repealed. One of them was 
the law that required you to get a background check before you could 
buy a gun.
  The researcher from Johns Hopkins sort of looked at all these laws, 
controlled for all sorts of other factors, and came to the conclusion--
you should read the paper; it is very well done--that it was this 
provision which removed the background check that led to this dramatic 
spike in violence. He has all sorts of interesting data to show why 
that is. All the other violent crime in Missouri stayed flat from 2008 
to 2012, but gun crimes spiked. All of a sudden, guns bought in 
Missouri were being used in crimes all over the region. Other States 
started to report an increase--a curious, sudden increase--in crime 
guns that were bought in Missouri. Well, guess why. It was because all 
of a sudden, you didn't have to get a background check if you wanted to 
buy a gun in Missouri. All of a sudden, criminals and people with 
serious mental illnesses could get guns through gun shows and internet 
sales--transactions on the private market--without that background 
check.
  I tell this story because I hear opponents of this bill in the House 
saying: This isn't meaningful. It won't work. These mass shootings 
weren't perpetuated with weapons that were bought without background 
checks.
  Well, that is true. This one public policy intervention won't stop 
every single bad thing that happens in this country. But the data is 
the data, and it shows us that States that have background checks have 
dramatically lower rates of gun crime than States that don't have them.
  A little bit earlier than the changes made in Missouri, my State of 
Connecticut made the opposite change. My State of Connecticut made a 
change to go from being a non-background check State to a background 
check State. We put in a local permit that came with a background check 
requirement. So even if you bought your gun outside of a bricks-and-
mortar gun store, you had to get a permit, and that permit required you 
to get a background check.
  Well, that same researcher went to Connecticut, ran all the numbers, 
and found out that in Connecticut, after that change was made, gun 
murders dropped by 40 percent. They increased in Missouri by about 25 
percent and decreased in Connecticut by about 40 percent--and again 
controlling for all sorts of other factors that could explain those 
changes.
  So on both sides of the ledger, there is what I would tell you is 
incontrovertible evidence that a State that has background checks is 
going to end up having many fewer gun crimes than a State that doesn't 
have them. The problem is, as we saw in and around Missouri, guns don't 
respect borders, so when Missouri dropped its gun background check 
requirement, those guns started moving into other States.
  That is what happened in my State. The guns that are used to commit 
crimes in our cities--the guns that are trafficked out of the back of 
vans--aren't bought from Connecticut gun stores; they are bought by 
criminals in other States because they know they can go to gun shows 
and they can turn to internet sales in those other States and buy those 
weapons.

  The same thing happens as weapons move across our border. I have 
heard an awful lot from this President about how dangerous Mexico and 
Central America are. Well, there is some truth to that, but the guns 
that are being used in those crimes are trafficked from the United 
States of America, and the way they get to the southern border is 
through States that don't have background check requirements.
  Just go online and check out what people say who have been arrested 
for gun trafficking. They tell you exactly how they did it. They go to 
gun shows in Texas. They buy guns at unregulated gun shows in Texas, 
and they take them back across the border and sell them in Central 
America.
  So we have all the evidence we need--empirical evidence, anecdotal 
evidence--to pass this piece of legislation, but maybe the most 
important reason that we should pass it, that we should take it up here 
in the Senate when it passes the House later today, is that it is just 
so darn popular. There really isn't anything else in America today that 
is as popular as universal background checks. The minimum score is 
about 90 percent. There is plenty of really good polling that says that 
97 percent of Americans support universal background checks. Grandma 
isn't that popular. Apple pie isn't that popular. There is nothing we 
debate here that gets 97 percent on agreement other than the issue of 
background checks.
  So I am here on the floor today to try to fill in some of the details 
on why this is so important and to implore my colleagues, once it 
passes the House of Representatives, to bring it here. Obviously, I 
would love to have a vote on


the House bill, but I understand how this place works. We are going to 
send a letter to Chairman Graham asking him to at the very least 
convene a hearing on background checks in the Judiciary Committee.
  We came to a conclusion here in the Senate as to a bipartisan 
background checks proposal that could get 50 votes--in 2013--and I 
would love to start that process again. But there is no reason not to 
do it because all the evidence tells us that when we make sure that 
only the right people buy guns, a lot less people die from gun crimes.
  This is not controversial anywhere except for Washington, DC. 
Everybody out there in the American public wants us to pass universal 
background checks. Maybe some other interventions in this space are a 
little bit more controversial, split folks a little bit more, but not 
background checks. This thing is decided outside of the Senate Chamber 
and the House Chamber. Popular in the public, deeply impactful, will 
save thousands of lives--that is a triple we don't get very often here, 
and we should take advantage of the opportunity.
  Let me leave you with this: I convened a panel a couple of nights ago 
to talk about the importance of background checks, and there were a 
number of parents of those who were lost to gun violence. One of the 
parents was from Sandy Hook. Another was a parent of a child who was 
killed in Chicago, and she really wanted to make sure we knew what the 
real impact of gun violence in America was. She wanted to make sure we 
knew that the victims aren't just those who show up on the police 
blotter; the victims are the parents and the brothers and the sisters 
and the friends and the coworkers.
  The average number of people who experience some diagnosable trauma 
when somebody in their life is shot and killed is 20. So when you hear 
the number that 100 people in the United States die every day from 
guns--which is a number 10 to 20 times higher than in any other high-
income nation on a per capita basis--you have to understand that number 
isn't really 100; that number is 20 times higher than that because the 
people who have to live with that loss have to ask these questions: Why 
did they shoot themselves? What do I do about that individual who shot 
my son? How do I get over that combination of pain and anger? That is 
hard to understand unless you have spent time with the mothers and the 
fathers who will be dealing with this catastrophic, life-changing 
trauma for the rest of the time they are on this Earth.
  So that is why this is so serious to me. It is because we have an 
answer for their pain--not an answer that will stop every gun crime in 
this country but an answer that will result in thousands fewer people 
dying. We know that because the evidence tells us that. And I can't 
explain to these families--to that mother in Chicago--why something 
that has been proven to work and is supported by 90 percent of 
Americans can't get a vote or a debate in the Senate.
  I will leave it at that for today. I hope that when this passes in 
the House with a big bipartisan majority, we will take advantage of the 
opportunity to get a big bipartisan majority here in the Senate. If the 
Republican majority commits to starting that process, I guarantee that 
will be the result.
  I want to thank all of the people who made this possible in the House 
today.
  For the record, I have introduced a version of H.R. 8 here in the 
U.S. Senate.
  To Chairman Nadler,   Mike Thompson, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader 
Hoyer, and to their Republican cosponsors who helped bring it to the 
floor--I thank them on behalf of all of the folks they will never know, 
those lives they will save by their action today if we do the right 
thing and take it up here in the Senate.
  I yield the floor.

1278,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,12,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it was 1986, a third of a century ago. 
Six U.S. Senators wrote a letter to the Office of Technology 
Assessment, the office then charged with providing technical and 
scientific advice to Congress.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed 
in the Record.",W000802,2019-02-27
1279,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,13,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. These six U.S. Senators were troubled by testimony 
they had heard about climate change in three separate hearings of the 
Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. They wrote:

       The testimony convincingly portrayed a fundamentally 
     altered planet, with shifts in ocean circulation and climate 
     zones; altered precipitation and storm patterns; more 
     frequent and extreme weather events such as droughts, 
     monsoons, and lowland floods. Individually and collectively, 
     these changes bring about others, ranging from disruption of 
     forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in 
     populations. Witnesses before the Committee testified that 
     the Earth is now committed to a substantial greenhouse 
     warming, projected to be about 2 degrees Centigrade, as well 
     as an ozone layer depletion.

  Well, that was quite a prediction. Who were these six Senators? 
Quentin


Burdick, Democrat from North Dakota; Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana; 
George Mitchell, Democrat from Maine; Robert Stafford, Republican from 
Vermont, the chairman then of the committee; Dave Durenberger, 
Republican of Minnesota; and Rhode Island's Republican Senator, John 
Chafee.
  You cannot help but be struck that the prediction back then by these 
six Senators is now our reality. Everything they predicted is 
happening. The scientists they listened to had it right. Global 
temperatures have already risen by around 1 degree Celsius, and we are 
headed to over 2 degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the 
century.
  Their grim predictions, which we now live with as fact, motivated 
these six Senators to ask the Office of Technology Assessment for 
policy options that ``could lead to the stabilization and minimization 
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.''
  Why did they want these policy options? They wanted to learn about 
policy options because, as they continued in their letter:

       Congress must soon begin to weigh the alternatives facing 
     the United States and other nations. . . . Due to the 
     likelihood that legislation will be considered by the 
     Committee early in the next Congress, it would be most 
     helpful if this analysis could be undertaken without delay.

  ``Without delay.'' Since then, Republicans have demolished the Office 
of Technology Assessment; that office no longer exists. Republicans 
have relentlessly blockaded legislation to address carbon emissions and 
have trafficked in phony climate denial, all while accepting hundreds 
of millions of dollars of political contributions from the fossil fuel 
industry.
  Today, five of those six States are represented again, having a 
reunion on the Senate floor. I see Senator Tester from Montana here. I 
will yield to him now. We will also be joined by Patrick Leahy of 
Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Angus King of Maine.
  I yield to Jon Tester of Montana, taking the position of his 
predecessor, Max Baucus--whom, by one of the weird coincidences of the 
Senate, I just passed coming out of the trolley.
  Senator Tester, the floor is yours.",W000802,2019-02-27

1281,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,15,Mr. TESTER,"  Mr. TESTER. I thank Senator Whitehouse.
  I could not in my wildest dreams be able to replace Senator Baucus in 
what he did. But what he did back in 1986, along with a number of other 
Senators Senator Whitehouse just talked about, was visionary.
  He signed a letter asking Federal researchers to study solutions for 
limiting the causes of climate change. This was in 1986, some 33 years 
ago. That same year, as I am today, my wife and I were farming in North 
Central Montana, a farm that then had been in the family for about 70 
years.
  During the time before 1986, and since 1986, we have seen a lot of 
changes on the farm. That is why it is interesting--because those 
changes have increased more than ever, I believe, in the last 20 years.
  When this letter was sent off to study solutions in 1986, it was 
incredibly visionary because it was before climate change was even 
talked about much. Yet this group of Senators was able to see the 
negative impacts of this coming down the pike.
  By the way, when we talk about negative impacts of climate change--
you probably have this, Senator Whitehouse, but somebody ought to put 
together how many hundreds of billions of dollars we have spent on 
natural disasters in the last 10 or 12 years compared to how much we 
spent in years previous. I can tell you, it was a few years ago that 
every State in the Union except one or maybe two had a natural 
disaster. That is because our climate is changing. It is because our 
climate is getting more erratic. I have seen it on our farm. I have 
seen August turn from the driest month to one of the wettest months. 
Over the last 20 years, I have seen a reservoir--a reservoir is a 
manmade area to hold water for livestock. I have seen a reservoir that 
never went dry from the time my father built it in the early 1950s to 
going dry for consecutive years. I have seen dangerous floods. I have 
seen water where we have never had it before. I have seen drought like 
we have never had it before.
  I would just say, in regard to that, we just had a vote on a guy by 
the name of Wheeler, whom the President nominated to lead the EPA, who 
actually is one of these guys who doesn't believe in climate change at 
all. I don't know where the President finds these people, and I don't 
know how this body can support somebody who is this big of a denier, 
who wants to slow enforcement on polluters.
  There is one thing we need to keep in mind in this country when we 
try to put people like Wheeler up for head of EPA. If you take a look 
at the third-world nations in this world, those are the nations that 
have destroyed their resource base. If you want to pollute our water 
and if you want to pollute our air, that is destroying our resource 
base. I guarantee you, that is not a way to make America great. It is 
not even a way to keep America great.
  This nominee is rolling back the clean water rule. He has allowed 
more uses for asbestos in commerce when, in our State of Montana, Libby 
can tell you all about asbestos. People are still dying from its 
effects.
  That aside--the Wheeler nomination, which is a catastrophe in 
itself--I could tell you that the Senators who stood on this very floor 
33 years ago understood--understood--that we have a challenge in front 
of us greater than any other challenge we have faced before, and that 
is climate. As we talk about what they did in 1986--we are in 2019 
now--now is the time to come up with some workable solutions--workable 
for our climate and workable for our economy--to get our arms around 
this very serious problem.
  I am going to tell you what is at risk here. I love Nevada, but I 
don't want Montana turning into an ecosystem like Nevada has. We raise 
some of the best wheat and the best cattle and the best post-crops in 
the world, but it takes a predictable environment to do that. In some 
places in our State, we are on the edge of desertification, turning 
into desert.
  The issue that revolves around climate change impacts each and every 
one of us in this body. Whether we are in denial or not, that is a 
fact, and it is incumbent upon us, as Senators who represent great 
States all around this Nation, to come up with solutions that our kids 
and our grandkids will be proud of.
  I yield the floor back to Senator Whitehouse.",T000464,2019-02-27
1282,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,16,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator Tester.
  I will turn to the Rhode Islander who was in that early bipartisan 
effort to understand and address climate change. Senator John Chafee's 
history of service to his State and country was remarkable. He saw 
bloody combat in World War II on Guadalcanal and Okinawa with the 1st 
Marine Division. He went back as a Marine rifle company commander 
during the Korean war with Dog Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines. He 
served in Rhode Island's legislature and as our Governor. In 1969, he 
was appointed Secretary of the Navy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate 
in 1976 and chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee from 
1995 until his death in 1999. In the small Rhode Island world, he was 
also my father's college roommate and lifelong friend.
  The environment was an abiding passion for this man, and his devotion 
showed in his work in the Senate. His legacy includes the Superfund 
Program, the Oil Pollution Act, and the 1990 amendments to the Clean 
Air Act, and his legacy is his early recognition that climate change, 
driven by carbon pollution, caused by fossil fuels, poses an 
existential threat to humanity and the planet we call home.
  At the 1986 hearing that led to this bipartisan letter, Chafee 
declared:

       This is not a matter of Chicken Little telling us the sky 
     is falling. The scientific evidence . . . is telling us we 
     have a problem; a serious problem.

  This is 1986, and the Republican chairman of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee is saying that the scientific evidence is 
telling us we have a serious problem.
  He went on to say:

       Scientists have characterized our treatment of the 
     greenhouse effect as a global experiment. It strikes me as a 
     form of planetary Russian roulette. . . . By not making 
     policy choices today, by sticking to a ``wait and see'' 
     approach . . . [b]y allowing these


     gases to continue to build in the atmosphere, this generation 
     may be committing all of us to severe economic and 
     environmental disruption without ever having decided that the 
     value of ``business as usual'' is worth the risks.
       Those who believe that these are problems to be dealt with 
     by future generations are misleading themselves.

  Senator John Chafee, 1986.
  I yield now to the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations 
Committee and honorary Senator pro tempore, Patrick Leahy, here on 
behalf of the State of Vermont.",W000802,2019-02-27
1283,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,17,Mr. LEAHY,"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from 
Rhode Island.
  I could not help but think--as I saw the picture of John Chafee, with 
whom I had the honor of serving here in the Senate--of John Chafee's 
close friendship with Robert Stafford, who was my senior Senator when I 
came here, both having served in World War II, both with a naval 
background, both people who cared first and foremost about the country 
and the environment. I am going to speak a little bit further about Bob 
Stafford as we go.

  When we laid John Chafee to rest in Rhode Island, I remember sitting 
there and listening to the eulogies. Both Republicans and Democrats 
were speaking about this man.
  Also, referring to what the Senator from Rhode Island has said, more 
than 30 years ago we had cooperation and bipartisanship. It was a 
hallmark of the U.S. Senate. It was a bipartisan group of Senators who 
sounded the alarm about climate change. They made a very modest request 
to the Office of Technology Assessment. They said: Study the issue of 
climate change and make recommendations to avert global disaster.
  Those Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, were concerned that 
human activity might directly cause permanent, destructive, and 
widespread changes to our planet's climate system--changes that would 
put our entire economy, ecosystem, and, our very own existence at risk.
  As I said, one of these Senators was my senior Senator, my mentor, 
when I came here and one of the finest Senators who ever served--
Republican Robert Stafford, from Vermont.
  Today, led by Senator Whitehouse, I think that what many of us are 
trying to do is what Senator Chafee and Senator Stafford did. We want 
to recall that moment in 1986 and renew the warning those Senators 
issued 33 years ago.
  Let me speak about Senator Stafford. When I came here at the ripe old 
age of 34, I was the only Democrat ever elected in my State. Robert 
Stafford was ``Mr. Republican.'' He took me under his wing. He had been 
a Congressman. He had been a Governor. He had been an attorney general. 
He served in World War II and in Korea. He was a mentor, but he was 
also an example. His legacy is one of sensible, pragmatic Vermont 
values that he brought to Washington for decades. They weren't 
Republican or Democratic.
  Senator Stafford was--like most Vermonters--a champion for the 
natural environment. With his work on landmark environmental 
legislation, like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the 
Superfund program, Senator Stafford represented the best of Vermont's 
commitment to sustainability.
  His appeals to reason and for common ground, and his belief in sound 
science resonate even more today than when he left this body three 
decades ago. If he were here today, I believe he would be calling on 
both sides of the aisle to act now to ensure that we can pass on a 
secure and livable planet for generations to come and to act before it 
is too late.
  Today, so many people still refuse to accept what is now an 
overwhelming scientific consensus--that climate change is real and that 
humans are the dominant cause of it. What is worse, for the last 2 
years many in Congress have willfully accelerated the devastation 
caused by global warming by enabling the Trump administration's erosion 
of our Nation's bedrock environmental protections--protections that I 
have fought for throughout my nearly 45 years in the Senate.
  As climate scientists warn of the urgent need to reduce emissions and 
reverse the global rise in temperatures, many Senators have refused to 
preserve even the status quo. Instead, in the last 2 years, we have 
seen the rollback of commonsense regulations, often at the behest of 
private interests that have spent decades misinforming the public and 
suppressing their own science on the long-term hazards of the fossil 
fuel industry.
  Alarmingly, this week the Senate is poised to confirm someone to lead 
the Environmental Protection Agency--the Agency that is charged with 
safeguarding the air and water on which we depend--who, despite the 
scientific consensus, denies that climate change is the great threat we 
face today.
  To growing numbers of Americans it is saddening--actually, it is 
maddening--and most of all, deeply alarming that the Trump 
administration and many others in leadership positions have made 
Trumpism's anti-science, know-nothing agenda their default position. 
This poses existential threats not only to our children and 
grandchildren but to our generation.
  More than three decades ago, long before protecting our planet became 
a partisan issue, the Environment and Public Works Committee held 3 
days of hearings on climate change. Those 1986 hearings compelled a 
bipartisan group of Senators to acknowledge and warn the public about a 
``fundamentally altered planet'' as a result of the ``substantial 
greenhouse warming'' that was projected.
  They asked what could be done to prevent consequences ``ranging from 
disruption of forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in 
population,'' and ``extreme weather events, such as droughts, monsoons, 
and lowland floods.'' These words of warning were neither radical nor 
partisan. They were sensible.
  So what has changed since then? The ice caps are melting--only 
faster. Certainly, the glaciers I saw when I visited Antarctica 25 or 
so years ago had been there for eons, and they are now fast 
disappearing. Our coastline is still disappearing but faster. Farmers 
and ranchers are still concerned about prolonged droughts and extreme 
weather, only, today, the fires and storms are more frequent and more 
devastating.
  Just last month, the intelligence community's ``Worldwide Threat 
Assessment'' offered a sobering conclusion. This is the intelligence 
community's assessment: ``Global environmental and ecological 
degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition 
for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 
and beyond.''
  We know that bipartisan action on big environmental threats is 
possible. In fact, soon after the climate change hearings in 1986, 
Marcelle and I climbed Vermont's Camel's Hump with President Reagan's 
EPA Administrator. We wanted to show him the terrible damage caused by 
acid rain. We could see that mountain from our home. We could see the 
changes up close. They were very obvious. With President Reagan's EPA 
Administrator's support, we moved ahead with the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990, and they were signed into law by President George 
H. W. Bush. It was not a partisan issue. The result was a great 
reduction in the scourge of acid rain. We see these results every day.
  Today we are in danger of taking such results for granted. It is up 
to us to protect this planet. If we don't, who will? There is no more 
urgent responsibility.
  There are bold ideas for how to address this challenge. The Green New 
Deal offers a valuable roadmap for debate and a pathway for action. The 
time for dallying around the edges of the issue is over. We all share 
responsibility for where we are today. So, likewise, we have an 
obligation to attack this issue, but not with cynical show votes, not 
with feel-good votes intended to demonstrate a political divide rather 
than what should be universal acknowledgment of what we know to be 
true--that climate change is real, and human activity is the primary 
cause of these threats to our way of life, our communities, and our 
planet.
  We have to channel the American innovative spirit that has improved 
our lives for centuries. We have to find creative solutions for 
reducing carbon emissions, and then we have to invest in those 
solutions. We have to reorient our workforce toward the great 
opportunities that are opening for green-economy jobs. We should invest 
in


leading the whole world in developing clean energy solutions. We have 
to address this real emergency head-on. Not only can we curb climate 
change, but, in doing so, we can transform the American economy.
  Over 30 years ago, a handful of forward-looking Republicans and 
Democrats stood together in this Senate. I was proud to be here when 
they issued their challenge, but the time for delay is over. In fact, 
our time is running out.
  Let this renewed vigor in addressing climate change, brought about by 
the bold proposed Green New Deal, be the catalyst for real change. 
Let's stand together.
  Senator Whitehouse has enlightened us on so many of these issues, but 
we have also learned, as he did, from our mentors--like Senator Chafee, 
Senator Stafford, and the others who got together in 1986. It is not 
partisan and it is not political. It is survival.

1284,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,18,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont, who 
is not only a towering physical presence on the floor of the Senate but 
a towering historic presence on this floor, as well, and brings a rare 
and valuable perspective. I appreciate his words so much.
  The sad thing that we face is that despite words like those uttered 
by Senator John Chafee--``allowing these gases to continue to build in 
the atmosphere . . . may be committing all of us to severe economic and 
environmental disruption''--or the words in the letter that John Chafee 
signed right here and that Senator Leahy's mentor, Bob Stafford, signed 
right here back on December 23, 1986, no Republican Senator can utter 
those words today. Today's Republican Party will not even acknowledge 
that climate change is a serious problem--let alone put forward a 
serious proposal to tackle it. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's 
latest trick is to call, for the first time, a climate-related measure 
on the Senate floor for his side to vote against it. The leader has not 
brought a single piece of climate legislation to the floor for a vote, 
ever, until this vote, which he is bringing up for his side to vote 
against.
  It actually gets worse. Since the infamous Citizens United Supreme 
Court decision almost 10 years ago, no Republican in the Senate has 
offered or sponsored comprehensive climate legislation to limit carbon 
pollution--none.
  So we look back with some real sorrow to 1986, when this bipartisan 
letter was written. Of course, Minnesota was represented in that letter 
by Dave Durenberger, and Minnesota is represented here on the floor 
today by Senator Klobuchar.

1286,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,20,Ms. KLOBUCHAR,"  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island 
for his leadership day in and day out on this issue.
  I rise to join him and my other colleagues to talk about this letter 
and to look back at that moment in time but really to do it to look 
forward because we know it is long past time for bipartisan action on 
climate change.
  As the Senator from Rhode Island has explained with a copy of that 
letter, back in 1986, a bipartisan group of Senators came together to 
voice their concerns about the future of our world.
  This forward-thinking group of our predecessors, who were from the 
same States as my colleagues who are here today, held 3 days of 
hearings on climate change. That sounds like a pretty good idea for 
something we should be doing right now. It was chaired by, of course, 
the Republican Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. John Chafee.
  Minnesota Senator David Durenberger was among that group of Senators. 
He was born in St. Cloud. He earned his law degree from the University 
of Minnesota, was the top-rated cadet in his ROTC class, and served as 
a lieutenant in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps and as a captain in 
the U.S. Army Reserve.
  Senator Durenberger took over the seat left by Senator Humphrey, and 
during his 17 years of service in the Senate, Senator Durenberger 
proved time and again that he is a true believer in bipartisanship. He 
worked across the aisle to tackle big issues, and that included talking 
about climate change way back in 1986.
  I called Senator Durenberger this week to talk to him, and our staff 
did, to get some sense of where he was on climate change years later. 
He reported to us that, in his words, he wanted to remind Americans 
there was a time in our very recent history when the U.S. Senate made 
it its responsibility to define and address some of the critical 
national and international policy issues that threaten the security of 
our communities, our Nation, and the world.
  This is Senator Durenberger speaking in the year 2019. He said he 
could say ``without reservation that it was bipartisan Senate 
leadership that encouraged the four Presidents with whom [he] served--
Carter, Reagan, [George H.W.] Bush, and Clinton--to prioritize 
environmental problem definition and solution.''
  He also recalled working with his colleagues on the Environment and 
Public Works Committee to ``challenge''--and these are his words--
``challenge the scientific community and the business community to work 
harder at reducing the impact [of greenhouse gases] and suggesting what 
policies best incentivize alternative fuels.''
  It was in this bipartisan spirit that this group of Senators sent a 
letter to Dr. John Gibbons, who was then the executive director of the 
Office of Technology Assessment. In that letter, they talked about the 
need to meet ``the massive and, to some degree irrevocable, alterations 
in the stratosphere commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect.''
  The letter goes on to discuss concerns about ``altered precipitation 
and storm patterns,'' something certainly the Senator from Rhode Island 
knows we are seeing right now. These Senators were ahead of their 
time--altered precipitation and storm patterns.
  ``[M]ore frequent and extreme weather events,'' they talked about 
that. Look at what we are seeing with the hurricanes, with the rising 
sea levels, and with the wildfires in Colorado and in California.
  ``[D]isruption of forest, crop, and ocean productivity.'' That letter 
may have been sent in 1986, but certainly those Democratic and 
Republican Senators were ahead of their time. Americans are now 
increasingly feeling the effects of changing climate patterns and 
extreme weather events. Farmers are already living through these 
disruptions to crop productivity.
  So what else did the letter say? Well, it said this: ``We are deeply 
troubled by the prospect of such a rapid and unprecedented change in 
the composition of the atmosphere and its implications for the human 
and natural worlds.'' It also stated that ``it may be necessary to act 
soon to at least slow these trends or, perhaps, halt them altogether.''
  Think of those words way back in 1986 asking us to act soon. They 
were right back then, and they are still right today. The true tragedy 
is that the final paragraph of the letter notes that any analysis 
should be undertaken without delay ``due to the likelihood that 
legislation will be seriously considered by the Committee early in the 
next Congress.''
  Well, the truth is, we are still waiting for that legislation to be 
seriously considered. The bipartisan call in that 1986 letter came in 
the 99th Congress, and we are now beginning the 116th. Just as 
troubling, we have lost some of the bipartisan spirit that guided David 
Durenberger and those 1986 lawmakers. Our inaction has outlasted even 
the Office of Technology Assessment itself.
  I ask my colleagues, in the spirit of bipartisanship--from back in 
1986, my colleague Senator Durenberger, who I hope is listening today--
let us continue that spirit, and let's get some serious climate 
legislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate.
  I yield the floor.",K000367,2019-02-27

1288,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,22,Mr. WHITEHOUSE,"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Klobuchar for her 
wonderful remarks, and of course Minnesota is a Northern State which 
sees this up close all the time.
  The Senator spoke of bipartisanship. Do you know who voted with 
Senator Chafee for the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990? The Republican 
Senate majority leader did, as did a majority of the Republican caucus 
in the Senate.
  In fact, those powerful 1990 Clean Air Act amendments passed 89 to 
10. Where do I go to get a majority leader like that back? Where do I 
go to get a Senate Republican Party like that back?


  As late as 2009, Donald Trump published an advertisement in the New 
York Times that said that the climate science was ``scientifically 
irrefutable''--scientifically irrefutable--and that if we didn't do 
anything about it, there would be ``catastrophic and irreversible 
consequences for humanity and our planet.'' That is Donald Trump in 
2009.
  Where do I go to get that Donald Trump back? What happened? In 2007, 
when I first joined this body, there were Republicans working on 
climate legislation all over the place. Senator Klobuchar and I came 
together that year. We had, by my count, five pieces of bipartisan 
climate legislation that were working through this body in various 
stages in 2007, 2008, and 2009, when Donald Trump put this 
advertisement in the New York Times saying that the science was 
scientifically irrefutable and the consequences would be catastrophic 
and irreversible.
  Then came January of 2010. Then came the Citizens United decision. 
Then came unlimited and often anonymous fossil fuel money sloshing 
around in America's politics and all the threats and promises that 
unlimited money allows special interest to engage in. Now, those days, 
the Donald Trump of 2009, Republican cooperation of 2007, 2008, and 
2009, and of course this letter from as long ago as 1986 seems 
impossible, but I hope we can get together. We have to do better than 
Republican political mischief on climate change.
  Calling up bills that you intend to vote against--give me a break. 
Where is the plan, the Republican, conservative, serious plan for 
addressing the climate crisis? I will tell you where it is. It is 
nowhere. Zero. Nada. Nothing. That has to stop.
  Here, on this letter, is one of the most distinguished, wonderful men 
ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, Mr. George Mitchell of the State of 
Maine, and here, representing him today, is Senator Angus King from the 
great State of Maine.

1290,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1510,24,Mr. KING,"  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise in sadness and somewhat perplexed 
because what we are doing in this colloquy is recreating a statement, a 
letter, as the Senator from Minnesota outlined, that was sent by six of 
our predecessors in December of 1986, warning about the dangers of 
climate change, warning about what this can do to our country and to 
our world, about costs, and about how we had to take action.
  One of those Senators was George Mitchell of Maine, one of the great 
legislators of the 20th century. I am honored to be in the seat that 
once was occupied by George Mitchell and also by his predecessor, 
Edmund Muskie. I think the story of the major environmental legislation 
of the 20th century, sponsored principally at the beginning by Edmund 
Muskie, the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, is worth mentioning, if 
only briefly.
  The most important point is that the Clean Air Act, one of the most 
important and comprehensive environmental pieces of legislation in our 
Nation's history, passed this body unanimously. It passed this body 
unanimously.
  It disturbs me that we couldn't agree on the time of day around here 
unanimously these days. I don't know when this issue became a partisan 
issue, but I deeply regret it because it is causing harm to our 
country.
  What I would like to do is step into George Mitchell's shoes for a 
moment and read a statement that he himself wrote and made back in 
1986, and you are not going to believe how prescient this statement is. 
It could have been written yesterday. Here are George Mitchell's words:

       The problem of global warming is one of immense 
     significance. It is the most serious and more pressing than 
     anticipated. Previously, most of the models forecasting the 
     rate of global warming focused on the air pollutants produced 
     by the combustion of fossil fuels. More recent data suggest 
     that trace gases may also increase the rate of warming by a 
     factor of two. This means that warming may be increasing 
     twice as fast as previously thought.
       The data produced to date suggests there may be an average 
     increase in temperature of 1 deg.C since the beginning of the 
     industrial revolution.

  This was in 1986. We are now at about 1.5 degrees centigrade.

       Considering how much warmer this June has been than 
     average, a 1 degree difference may appear to be 
     insignificant, but an average of 1 degree increase could be 
     devastating, so the experts tell us. A 1 degree increase in 
     the average global temperature would melt glaciers--

  That is happening--

     and such melting would increase the sea level.

  That is happening.

       There are uncertainties in predicting how much the sea 
     level would increase in a particular area. In some cases, it 
     could be an average increase of a few feet; in others, much 
     more. For a coastal State like Maine and to other States 
     along the coastline, such an increase would be devastating.

  To deviate from George's words for a moment, this is what we see 
happening. We are now seeing what are called rainy day floods, flooding 
in areas of our country along the coast that were rare. Six-month 
events are now every high tide.
  George Mitchell says:

       An average of 1 degree increase in temperature could have 
     major impacts on agriculture. This country's Midwestern bread 
     basket could again become a dust bowl. More heat would mean 
     less water for crops and variations in growing seasons. It is 
     important to keep in mind that this average increase is 
     global in nature. It is not a national or regional problem. 
     If American farmers suffer for lack of water, so will farmers 
     all over the planet. If shorelines along our coasts are 
     flooded, so will shorelines everywhere in the world.
       The enormity of this phenomenon is staggering, and we have 
     a responsibility to limit emissions of pollutants that trap 
     the heat in our atmosphere. As difficult, as immense, and as 
     seemingly remote as the problem is to our daily lives, we 
     cannot delay.

  This was George Mitchell in 1986--we cannot delay.

       There will be those who argue that more research is 
     necessary to completely understand the phenomenon and to 
     answer every scientific question.

  We are still hearing that argument today--we need more science; we 
need more studies; we are not sure.
  George goes on:

       As in the case of acid rain, such complete understanding 
     will come only after we flounder in the weight of our 
     shortsighted policies. This is one more indication that the 
     benefits of industrialization carry with them the burden of 
     controlling pollutants. These pollutants threaten our lakes, 
     fish, health, and forests today in the form of acid 
     deposition.
       We will hear today that these pollutants also threaten the 
     future of our planet, which cannot tolerate such a sudden and 
     dramatic increase in temperature and survive in a form 
     familiar to us.

  In 1986 George Mitchell said:

       Solutions are possible and available. The statement 
     released at the conclusion of the Villach Conference in 
     Austria last October--

  This was in 1985--

     addresses the common nature of some of our environmental 
     problems. That statement said in part that ``climate change 
     and sea level rises due to greenhouse gases are closely 
     linked with other major environmental issues, such as acid 
     deposition and threats to the Earth's ozone shield, mostly 
     due to changes in the composition of the atmosphere by human 
     activity.''
       Reduction in coal and oil use and energy conservation 
     undertaken to reduce acid deposition will also lower 
     concentration of greenhouse gases. Reductions in emissions of 
     chlorofluorocarbons--

  Which we achieved--

     will help protect the ozone layer and will also slow the rate 
     of climate change. The rate and degree of future warming 
     could be profoundly affected by governmental policies on 
     energy conservation, use of fossil fuels, and the emission of 
     greenhouse gases.

  Those words were written 32 years ago.

       The rate and degree of future warming could be profoundly 
     affected by governmental policies on energy conservation, use 
     of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases.

  The testimony that they were intending to hear at the hearing that 
George is describing demonstrated ``that such governmental policies are 
needed . . . nationally and on a global basis.''
  I pause on ``a global basis''--the tragedy of leaving the Paris 
climate accord, because the only solution to this problem has to be 
local, national, and global.
  The testimony from Federal Agencies will be that the current 
government policy is to conduct more research, a familiar refrain on 
issues of this type. George Mitchell said:

       What is missing in the Federal effort is action. The 
     problem of global warming brings another round of scientists 
     before us decrying the folly of waiting until it is too late 
     to


     prevent irreversible damage. In the case of acid rain, 
     research has been offered as a substitute for much-needed 
     action. This policy has produced more bodies of water that 
     cannot sustain life, more trees that are dying, and more 
     people who find it hard to breathe.
       The policy has produced more studies, not any meaningful 
     change in policy. I hope these two days of hearings will help 
     persuade the administration--

  And the people of the country--

       that inaction has its own costs, almost invariably higher 
     than the cost of action.

  George Mitchell was right. The cost of inaction is invariably higher 
than the cost of action.
  George concluded by saying:

       I represent a State that already has been affected by acid 
     deposition. I want to do all I can to keep Maine, the rest of 
     our country, and our planet from facing potentially more 
     dramatic environmental damage from global warming. The best 
     way to avoid these undesirable outcomes is to begin taking 
     action now to prevent further damage rather than spending 
     twice as much time and later money repairing damage.

  George Mitchell was right in 1986. Tragically, he is even more right 
today because we did not heed his call. We did not take action. We have 
avoided action.
  I don't want to be the generation that our children and grandchildren 
look back on and say: Where were you and what did you do when the 
climate was deteriorating, when the glaciers were melting, when the ice 
sheets were melting, when the sea level was rising, when the storms 
were increasing in intensity, when the wildfires were burning our 
States? What did you do, Senator?
  I, for one, want the answer to be ``I took action.'' The answer 
should be ``we took action.''
  Today, this is a challenge even greater--significantly greater--than 
it was in 1986, but the very fact that people like Quentin Burdick, 
George Mitchell, John Chafee, Bob Stafford, and David Durenberger saw 
the future and predicted it so succinctly and profoundly should spur us 
to the type of action that is necessary to meet, confront, and overcome 
this most serious of challenges before us.
  Thank you.

S. Res. 70, which authorizes funding for the Senate's committees from 
March 1, 2019, through February 28, 2021. For this 24-month period, the 
18 committees covered by this resolution are authorized to spend up to 
$214,055,860. This is a small increase over the funding authorized by 
the current committee funding resolution, S. Res. 62. For the 
information of my colleagues, committee funding authorized by S. Res. 
70 remains 13 percent below levels from a decade ago.
  Committees are the lifeblood of the legislative process. It is in our 
committees that policy is created and programs and agencies are 
overseen. Our committees are where the Senate first exercises its 
advice and consent function over the executive branch's nominees. Well-
functioning committees are crucial to the Senate's role as a separate 
but equal branch of the government.
  The resolution before the Senate is the result of a bipartisan 
process Senator Klobuchar, the Rules Committee's ranking member, and I 
undertook this year to solicit more input from committee chairmen and 
ranking members. The resolution reflects the needs identified by our 
colleagues and will help ensure our committees are able to carry out 
their responsibilities and duties.
  I would like to thank Fitz Elder and Rachelle Schroeder from my 
committee staff; Lizzy Peluso and Lindsey Kerr from Senator Klobuchar's 
committee staff; and Cindy Qualley, the Rules Committee's chief clerk. 
Additionally, I would like to thank Ileana Garcia and Ted Ruckner from 
the Disbursing Office and John Henderson from the Office of Legislative 
Counsel. I greatly appreciate their hard work in developing this 
resolution.

legacy of Arkansas businessman and Tyson Foods founder, the late John 
William Tyson.
  John spent his life building Tyson Foods into one of the world's 
leading food companies and was equally committed to serving northwest 
Arkansas.
  In 1931, John Tyson moved his family to Springdale with only a nickel 
in his pocket. There, he laid the foundation for a future Fortune 100 
company.
  John transformed the poultry industry. He developed a novel in-
transit feeding system, hatched chickens, and produced commercial feed 
himself. With each new venture, John diversified and grew his business.
  In 1947, Tyson Feed and Hatchery was incorporated. Over time, the 
business expanded to become the successful company that we know today.
  He exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of our State, and it is for 
his contributions to the Arkansas economy that he is being posthumously 
enshrined in the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.
  I congratulate his family for this terrific honor.

I admire him so much. I just want to applaud him and applaud his early 
work as a missionary in Honduras.
  During our past recess, Senator Jeff Merkley and I and four of our 
colleagues from the House were privileged to be a part of a 5-day 
congressional delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. We 
were there to find out how the Alliance for Prosperity was being 
implemented, of which the Senator has been very supportive, as have I, 
in order to focus on hope, economic opportunity, crime, violence, and 
corruption.
  The Alliance for Prosperity is focused on all of those matters. The 
United States puts up some of the money to address them, but we expect 
the other countries, including Honduras, to put up even more. It is 
like being at Home Depot--you can do it, and we can help. For every $1 
in El Salvador, they put up $7, and we leverage our money to get the 
support of foundations, NGOs, private companies, and others to do their 
share. It is like turning the course of an aircraft carrier, and it is 
starting to turn.
  Probably late this week--maybe tomorrow--I suspect Senator Merkley 
and I will want to have a colloquy on the floor. It would be great if 
the Senator could join us because he has forgotten more about that part 
of the world than we will ever know.
  Thank you.
  I didn't come to the floor to focus on that, but I am glad I had the 
chance to since Senator Kaine was here.

                      Nomination of Andrew Wheeler
",,2019-02-27
1303,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1527-2,3,Mr. CASEY,"  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the debate 
that we


are having with regard to the nomination or, I should say, confirmation 
of the EPA Administrator.
  All of us in this Chamber and the other body, the U.S. House of 
Representatives--frankly, anyone in government--has an obligation to 
act in accordance with a goal of being good stewards of the Earth. Some 
might call it creation care--care of God's creation.
  Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency, under its current 
leadership, is, in my judgment, failing to meet that obligation. From 
day one, the administration has prioritized gutting environmental 
protections and rolling back policies that had us on a path toward a 
more sustainable future.
  From attacking the Clean Power Plan to weakening methane protection 
standards, this administration has repeatedly prioritized the interests 
of polluters over the health and wellness of the American people.
  Andrew Wheeler, the nominee, if he is confirmed to run the EPA or, I 
should say, the Environmental Protection Agency, which we call the 
EPA--this assault on clean air, clean water, and so many other 
protections will continue if he is, in fact, confirmed.
  Some of the most troubling EPA actions have come while Mr. Wheeler 
has been running the EPA in an acting capacity.
  In recent weeks, the EPA has decided to move forward with a rollback 
of the clean car standard and to gut the mercury and air toxics rule. 
These moves will harm public health and the health of our children, in 
particular.
  The American Lung Association reports that 5 Pennsylvania counties, 5 
of our 67 counties, which are home to approximately 4 million people, 
rank among the top 25 counties most polluted by particulate matter year 
round.
  Rolling back the clean car standards and clean air standards will 
cause more exposure to harmful pollutants that lead to increased 
mortality, respiratory problems, emergency room visits, and work-loss 
days.
  As we know, the transportation sector is the largest source of 
greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. We also know that the 
MATS rule, the so-called mercury and air toxics rule, is an 
environmental and public health success story.
  Mercury pollution is particularly harmful for unborn children, who 
are much more sensitive to exposure and who may suffer neurological and 
developmental problems.
  Powerplant mercury emissions have declined by 90 percent because of 
the MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of schedule and at one-third of 
the projected cost. Let me say that again. Powerplant mercury emissions 
have declined by 90 percent because of the MATS rule. This was achieved 
ahead of schedule and at one-third of the scheduled cost.
  Let me give testimony from two Pennsylvanians--partial testimonies, 
though they are from longer letters that they wrote to us.
  Mollie Michel of South Philadelphia wrote to me, and I am quoting 
her:

       As parents, my husband and I spend a lot of time making 
     sure our daughters are safe and healthy. We make sure they 
     eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, do their homework, and 
     treat each other and their peers with kindness and respect. 
     But the one thing we cannot control is the air they breathe. 
     For that, we rely upon our elected officials to enact the 
     policies that protect the health and well-being of my 
     children.

  The only thing I would correct in Mollie's excerpt of her letter is 
that it is the obligation not just of elected officials but of 
appointed officials, as well--those confirmed by the U.S. Senate, in 
this case, the Administrator of the EPA. Of course, it is our duty, as 
elected officials, to make sure that we confirm people who will meet 
the legitimate expectations of a mom like Mollie.
  Patrice from Gibsonia, PA, wrote to me to say:

       As a mom of two boys, I am deeply concerned by the track 
     record of Acting Administrator Wheeler. He has spent his time 
     at EPA proposing and implementing dangerous rollbacks to and 
     attacks on pollution protections. He is putting our 
     children's health and future at risk.

  So said Patrice of Gibsonia.
  While we are on the subject of major threats to the environment, 
major threats to our communities, to our children, and to our families, 
we cannot forget about climate change itself. Climate change is a 
threat to the health and well-being of our children and future 
generations. We must take action to address the global climate crisis 
with a sense of urgency and determination. The effects of climate 
change are real and have become worse, and unless we take action, we 
are going to be in a position where it will be impossible to take any 
action if we do it too late.
  We can address the challenge of climate change and continue to 
protect jobs. We can and we must do both. One is not exclusive of the 
other. We have already demonstrated that we can make advancements in 
clean energy and that it can happen quickly while also benefiting the 
economy and creating jobs.
  According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and 
Bloomberg New Energy Finance, renewables--renewable sources of energy--
now account for 18 percent of power generation in the United States, up 
from just 9 percent in 2008.
  According to the 2018 U.S. Energy Employment Report, the wind and 
solar industries support three times as many jobs as oil and gas--three 
times as many jobs as oil and gas. According to S&P Global, battery 
storage cost for a 20-megawatt facility declined by 40 percent in 2018. 
So I think it is entirely possible, and the data proves it, to deal 
with this crisis, to meet our obligations, to continue to create and 
grow jobs, and also to make sure that our economy grows as well.
  I live in a State where more than a generation ago we passed a State 
Constitution provision. Article I, section 27 of the Pennsylvania 
Constitution says in pertinent part that people have a right to clean 
air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural scenic, 
historic, and aesthetic values of the environment. That constitutional 
provision goes on to say that we are trustees. We, the citizens of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are the trustees of our natural 
resources, and they specifically talk about future generations.
  That is my obligation, not only as a citizen of the Commonwealth and 
not only as an elected official but, I believe, as an American as well.
  To confront these crises--whether it is attacks on clean power 
standards, clean air and clean water standards or whether it is the 
challenge of climate change itself--we need an EPA and an EPA 
Administrator who is totally committed to that same spirit that is set 
forth in that State constitutional provision that the people have a 
right to clean air and clean water, and, I would argue in a larger 
sense, the right to the kind of creation here that is connected 
directly to the question of climate change.
  We are talking about God's creation and preserving His creation. If 
we are trying to preserve God's creation, we better make sure we 
nominate and confirm people committed to preserving creation itself. We 
are but stewards of that creation.

 Remembering Colonel Joe Jackson and Lieutenant Colonel Charles Kettles
",,2019-02-27
1307,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1527-2,7,Mr. COTTON,"  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to 
commemorate two Medal of Honor recipients who passed away last month. 
Every Medal of Honor recipient has served his country with 
extraordinary valor and with little or no regard for his own life and 
safety.
  Air Force Col. Joe Jackson and Army LTC Charles Kettles were no 
exceptions. They were both pilots and both served honorably in the 
Vietnam war. Both were responsible for extraordinary rescue missions of 
American soldiers trapped deep behind enemy lines against incredible 
odds. These two men were patriots who by chance, skill, and strength of 
character became true American heroes. They are gone now, but their 
legacies and examples will always live on. It is up to us to learn from 
them.
  Col. Joe Jackson passed away on January 12 at the age of 95.
  Jackson enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941, serving as a gunnery 
instructor for the duration of World War


II. But he may never have been a pilot--may never have been a hero--if 
not for a chance event in that war.
  One of his friends, a flight engineer, fell ill right before a B-25 
bomber flight. Jackson agreed to take his place. During the flight, one 
of the engines caught fire. The pilot didn't know what to do, but 
Jackson did. His timely instructions helped extinguish the fire, 
possibly saving the aircraft. Emboldened by this incident, Jackson 
decided to become a pilot--and he did, flying 107 missions as an F-84 
Thunderjet pilot during the Korean war and becoming one of the very 
first pilots of the U-2 spy plane.
  That in itself would be a pretty distinguished career of honorable 
service, but Joe Jackson returned for more, decades later. At the age 
of 45 he answered the call of service once again, volunteering with the 
Air Force's 311th Air Commando Squadron to fly cargo planes in Vietnam. 
It is not often a cargo pilot gets a chance to distinguish himself in 
combat, but it was in that very role that Joe Jackson earned the 
Nation's highest honor.
  May 12, 1968, was supposed to be a routine cargo mission for Joe 
Jackson and the crew of his C-123. That all changed when the American 
special forces camp at Kham Duc was attacked by the North Vietnamese. 
As the Viet Cong overran the camp and established firing positions just 
off the landing strip, an emergency evacuation began of the much 
smaller American contingent.
  The evacuation quickly turned into a turkey shoot. Eight aircraft and 
helicopters were shot down or destroyed on the runway during the 
desperate evacuation of Kham Duc. In a horrible tragedy, one cargo 
plane was shot down by North Vietnamese forces shortly after takeoff. 
All aboard the aircraft perished--the American air crew, plus some 150 
South Vietnamese civilians. Eventually, the airlift succeeded in 
evacuating nearly all of the camp's survivors. But as the last 
scheduled plane left the runway and the order was given to bomb the 
remainder of the camp, a horrible discovery was made: Three American 
soldiers had accidentally been left on the ground. Joe Jackson's plane 
was the closest to the area, so he made a split-second decision. 
``We're going in,'' he said.
  The C-123 cargo plane was not known for its agility, but Joe Jackson 
tested its limits as an aircraft. He banked the plane into a 
breathtaking turn and descent, dropping 9,000 feet to the runway in a 
matter of seconds. The plane instantly drew fire from the enemy, 
including an anti-armor rocket that crashed just shy of the aircraft 
but, providentially, did not detonate. The three beleaguered soldiers 
boarded Joe Jackson's aircraft, and he gunned it, lifting them to 
safety.
  That terrible assault on Kham Duc exacted a high toll in American 
lives. But thanks to Joe Jackson's quick wits and skillful flying, that 
toll was much lower.
  Joe Jackson remained in the Air Force until 1974, when he retired as 
a full colonel. He taught at the Air Force Air War College so that 
future pilots could learn from his example. Then he worked for Boeing, 
helping that great company build airplanes for use in peacetime, not 
just wartime. He ultimately settled in Kent, WA, with Rosamund, his 
wife, to whom he was married for 74 years and with whom he had two 
children.
  Joe Jackson was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon 
Johnson in January of 1969. He later described the heavy burden that 
recipients of that honor must shoulder. He said:

       I have to represent the thousands of Americans who have 
     served the country. You have to make them proud of what you 
     have done and what they have done.

  As a former soldier and as an American, let me state that there can 
be no finer representative of courage under fire than Joe Jackson. May 
he rest in peace.
  LTC Charles Kettles passed away on January 21 at the age of 89.
  Kettles was a helicopter pilot with the Army's 176th Assault 
Helicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, Task Force Oregon.
  Flying was in Kettles' blood. He was born in Ypsilanti, MI, to a 
father who had flown for the Canadian Royal Air Force in World War I 
and later for the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.
  Kettles was drafted in 1951, which began a whirlwind of Active Duty 
tours in Korea, Japan, and Thailand. He returned to the armed services 
in 1963, volunteering as a pilot. That is one thing to note about 
Charles Kettles. He was always willing to volunteer for dangerous 
assignments. Vietnam would give him many opportunities to volunteer.
  On May 15, 1967, then-Major Kettles volunteered to lead a flight of 
six Hueys to reinforce the brigade of the 101st Airborne Division that 
had been ambushed by a battalion of North Vietnamese.
  The situation was pretty hairy. It pitted Americans against hundreds 
of the VC, and the Americans were taking heavy fire. Worse still, they 
were trapped in little cover in what was called ``Chump Valley,'' so 
nicknamed because only a chump would go there.
  Major Kettles and his team landed under heavy fire from the enemy. 
One of the aviators later recalled that the tracers were ``like rain . 
. . coming straight out of the wood line.'' So intense was the enemy 
fire that several Americans were killed as they approached the 
evacuation zone. Nevertheless, Major Kettles stayed until 
reinforcements were offloaded and wounded soldiers were brought on 
board.
  After that insertion, Major Kettles returned to the battlefield a 
second time when his helicopter was raked front to back by machine-gun 
fire. Mechanics later counted 40 holes in his Huey. Major Kettles' 
gunner was seriously wounded in this trip, but Kettles piloted his 
aircraft, limping back to base streaming fuel.
  Those two flights would be a full day's work and then some for any 
aviator, but Major Kettles wasn't done yet.
  Later that day, with the situation in the valley growing yet more 
desperate, Kettles volunteered for a third time to evacuate the 
remaining 44 soldiers. So dangerous was the situation that Kettles was 
ordered to stand down. However, he disobeyed that order.
  Kettles led six helicopters on a third landing as fiercely contested 
by the enemy as the previous two. Soon the last helicopter reported all 
personnel were evacuated off the ground, and the helicopters evacuated 
the area. The all clear had been given too soon; a small group of 
American soldiers who were bravely fighting a rearguard action had been 
left behind.
  One of those soldiers later recalled the feeling when he saw the 
helicopters disappear over the jungle canopy: ``If it's possible for 
your heart to fall into your boots, that's what mine did.''
  There were now eight Americans stranded in Chump Valley against 
hundreds of Viet Cong. Those are long odds even for the Screaming 
Eagles of the 101st.
  So for the fourth time that day--the fourth time--in a split-second 
decision, Kettles turned around his aircraft to land in a hot LZ. This 
time he returned alone with no gunship support.
  When he landed, a mortar exploded near the front of his aircraft, 
blowing out his Huey's chin bubble, windshields, tail boom, and rotor. 
His helicopter returned with 40 holes and was 600 pounds overweight 
because all eight American soldiers were onboard. They all attribute 
their survival to his brave actions.
  Kettles was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his 
extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, but he wasn't immediately 
awarded the Medal of Honor. There is one thing Charles Kettles wouldn't 
volunteer for--the spotlight. He accepted the Distinguished Service 
Cross and moved on with his life, retiring from the military in 1978 
after another tour in Vietnam.

  Kettles moved back to Michigan, where he taught aviation management 
at Eastern Michigan University and worked for Chrysler Pentastar 
Aviation. He married twice and had nine children, who survive him, 
along with his wife Ann.
  That is how the Kettles' story may have ended if not for a local 
historian who persuaded Congress and the Army to reopen the file. When 
they did, it became apparent to all that he deserved the Nation's 
highest honor. Charles Kettles was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2016 
at the young age of 86. Kettles did what he could to downplay his role 
in saving his comrades in arms. According to him, ``The bottom line of 
the whole thing is simply that those 44 [soldiers] did get out of there 
and are


not a statistic on that wall in DC. The rest of it is rather 
immaterial, frankly.''
  Pardon me here if I disagree for once with Lieutenant Colonel 
Kettles. It was due to his bravery that those 44 soldiers returned 
alive and back to their families. On the battlefield, valor is hardly 
immaterial; it is essential. Charles Kettles proved that on his four 
volunteer rescue flights that fateful day.
  May he rest in peace. May both of these great warriors rest in peace.

                         Tribute to Maura Keefe
",,2019-02-27
1309,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1527-2,9,Mrs. SHAHEEN,"  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon 
with mixed emotions--mixed emotions because I feel a tremendous sense 
of gratitude but also sadness because at the end of this month, 
tomorrow, after more than a decade of working together, my chief of 
staff, Maura Keefe, will leave to start a new adventure.
  Maura is here on the floor today with my new chief of staff, Chad 
Kreikemeier, and most of our staff here in DC are in the Gallery 
watching. Everyone is here because we think so much of Maura, and we 
are so sad that she is leaving but wish her Godspeed in everything she 
does. She has been an incredible asset as we worked together to improve 
the lives of Granite Staters.
  I must thank her for her service and share some of the memories from 
the past 10 years. In New Hampshire, where we are the home of the first 
primary State, public service and political engagement are part of our 
culture. It is a culture that is epitomized by Maura and her family.
  Maura helped me get elected in 2008. Actually, she helped me before 
that--in 2002, when I didn't win the election. Despite our loss, she 
came back and she worked with me in 2008, and then when we won, she set 
up the office. She had already accumulated several careers by that time 
in political campaigns and nonprofits and in the private sector. At 
each and every step along the way, Maura made new friendships, and she 
blazed a trail of accomplishments. Her time with us has certainly been 
no different.
  I remember right after that election, she and a small group of people 
were working to set up the office. She showed me the files of people 
who were interested in working on the staff. I was down here for 
orientation, and she and the woman who would become the deputy chief of 
staff spent the whole weekend--while I was running around doing fun 
things, they were working into the night to go through those resumes to 
hire the best possible people to open the office.
  Maura's father, who served as chief of staff to New Hampshire Senator 
Tom McIntyre, whose seat I now hold, would be very proud of everything 
she has done and all of her accomplishments.
  I will never be able to thank her enough for building our wonderful 
team, for hiring a staff of dedicated public servants who work hard for 
the people of New Hampshire.
  Those of us who have had the pleasure to work with Maura know her 
sense of humor. She does great birthday cards that are very funny. 
Every month when we do birthdays in the office, she does farewell cards 
that are sort of testimonials but more roasts--or equally roast and 
testimonial. Her sense of humanity is also what makes her special. I 
have certainly benefited from both of these over the last 10 years.
  Maura is going to be missed, not just in our offices here in 
Washington and in New Hampshire but throughout the Senate because for 
the last several years, she has played an important leadership role 
among the Democratic chiefs of staff and among the women chiefs of 
staff. She has made a positive difference for all of our offices, and 
she has made important and constructive inroads with Senate leadership 
on both sides of the aisle. Her presence will be missed by so many 
people in this institution.
  Of course she is going to be missed for forging important consensus 
on the golf course as well. Our office does a golf outing every summer, 
and Maura is always the one who comes out on top in those golf outings. 
She has two holes in one, and she displays the plaques for those holes 
in one on the wall that is between our two offices. They are a reminder 
that from the Capitol to the tee box and everywhere in between, Maura 
is a fierce competitor.
  Over the last 10 years, there have been real historic moments. I hope 
those moments will be the cornerstone of Maura's memories from the 
Senate--the passage of healthcare reform that was decades in the 
making, ushering in the first bipartisan energy efficiency legislation 
in a generation, working to put a woman on the twenty-dollar bill, 
increasing funding and resources to combat the opioid crisis, expanding 
critical investments for the Office on Violence Against Women, and so 
many other critical infrastructure projects, changes in New Hampshire 
that have meant jobs and that have improved the lives of so many of our 
citizens.
  Perhaps the most succinct description of Maura can be credited to 
Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, for whom Maura worked as chief of staff in 
the 1990s. Congresswoman DeLauro once told a reporter aptly that Maura 
is ``someone who doesn't mince words.'' I can attest to that. When I do 
things that she thinks are not quite what I ought to be doing, she 
doesn't mince words; she lets me have it.
  I am going to greatly miss her daily doses of wisdom and wit. Her 
supporting counsel has always been invaluable to me. I can't thank her 
enough for her dedicated service.
  Thank you, Maura. We are all going to miss you but me, most of all.
  Thank you, Madam President.

                      Nomination of Andrew Wheeler
",,2019-02-27
1311,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1527-2,11,Mr. CARDIN,"  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as we are considering the leadership of 
the Environmental Protection Agency, I think we should pause a moment 
to recognize this administration's record on the environment--or should 
I say the missed opportunities--and what this administration has done 
in moving America in the wrong direction on environmental protection. 
This administration's record in dealing with the greatest challenge we 
have--global climate change--is deplorable.
  I had the opportunity to lead a delegation of 10 Members of the 
Senate to the Paris climate talks in which U.S. leadership demonstrated 
our ability to get universal consensus that climate change is real, is 
happening, that it is primarily caused by the activities we do here on 
Earth, and that we can make a difference in the trajectory of climate 
change and the impact it will have on our lives. If we follow what 
science tells us, we can change the course for the better for future 
generations.
  I saw in Paris the importance of U.S. leadership. We had been trying 
for a long time to get a global agreement to deal with this challenge. 
It wasn't until America's leadership in Paris that we were able to get 
a global consensus. In fact, every country in the world signed on to 
the Paris Agreement and recognized that every nation has the 
responsibility to respond because what happens in the environment knows 
no state boundaries--we are all in this together.
  Then there was the election of Donald Trump as President of the 
United States. One of his first actions was to withdraw America from 
the Paris climate agreement. America became the only Nation in the 
world not to be part of the global effort to deal with climate change.
  Our leadership was now going to be lost, but the Trump administration 
didn't stop there. They have withdrawn the powerplant rules even though 
it was in 2007 that the Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. EPA, 
determined that carbon dioxide is a dangerous air pollutant and is 
required to be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under 
the clean air rules. Yet the administration is moving in the other 
direction as it relates to clean air.
  They did the same thing with water. The Supreme Court issued certain 
decisions in regard to regulated waters. It required Congress to act. 
Congress didn't act. The administration under President Obama issued 
regulations that were similar to what we had before the Supreme Court 
decision, and now the Trump administration has withdrawn those 
regulations as they relate to clean water.
  The list goes on. The Trump administration is now backing down on 
CAFE standards. That is energy efficiencies


in our automobiles. Maryland is one of 12 States under section 177 that 
follow California's tougher standards. That is now being jeopardized by 
the Trump administration.
  As we are considering the leadership of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, we have to recognize that the Trump administration has moved us 
in the wrong direction. We take pride that with every administration, 
Congress adds to the protections we have for clean air and clean water 
and dealing with our environment. Yet we find with this President, the 
opposite is true. That puts special responsibility on us in Congress. 
We have to fill that vacuum. Yet the Republican leadership in Congress 
has made no effort to bring forward legislation to deal with climate 
change. They have not acknowledged that climate change is real. They 
have not acknowledged that our activities here are the primary cause of 
climate change. They have not acknowledged that science tells us that 
if we do the right thing, we can affect for the better the impact of 
climate change in our communities. All that has been denied by this 
administration.
  What we should do is bring forward comprehensive legislation to 
reduce greenhouse gases. We should put a true cost on carbon. Let the 
market forces help solve the problems we have here. We should provide 
for the continued efficiency of the transportation sector. We should 
restore America's leadership. That is what this Congress should be 
considering. Yet under Republican leadership, we have had no 
opportunity to consider comprehensive legislation in this area.
  If we acted, it would be good for our environment. There is no 
question about that. Why should we all be concerned about that? Let me 
give some examples from my State of Maryland. Over the last 50 years, 
Maryland has experienced a 70-percent increase in rainfall. Tell the 
people of Ellicott City, who have experienced two 1,000-year floods in 
the last 20-month period. These are floods that they have never seen 
before in their lifetime. A large amount of rain that fell in a very 
short period of time caused tremendous damage to the people of Ellicott 
City. Tell the 13 million people who are in danger of being displaced 
by the end of this century because of rising sea levels. Tell the 
people in the Western United States whose homes were taken by 
wildfires. We need to act. It would be good for our environment.
  I am proud to be one of the Senators who represent the Chesapeake Bay 
Watershed. There are 18 million people who live in the Chesapeake Bay 
Watershed. We see a rise in the sea level. This is a vulnerable body of 
water.
  The warming of the Chesapeake Bay is causing the loss of seagrasses 
that are important for the aquatic life. The salinity of the bay is 
being diminished because of more freshwater, and that is affecting the 
ecology of the bay. Algae growths are greater and longer because of the 
warm waters. All of that affects the Chesapeake Bay. If we respond to 
climate change, we have a much better chance of improving the quality 
of the Chesapeake Bay, which is critically important for the way of 
life for the people who live in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
  It is also, by the way, an important economic issue. If we do what is 
right and respond to climate change, we will also be helping our 
economy. The Chesapeake Bay alone adds $1 trillion to our economy. A 
clean bay helps our economy. Green energy creates jobs--many more jobs 
than do traditional fossil fuels.
  It also is good for our national security. If we use more of the 
renewables and fewer fossil, we as a nation will be stronger from the 
point of view of not being dependent on other countries that don't 
agree with our way of life for supplying energy needs not only to us 
but to our allies around the world--to the democratic countries around 
the world. It makes sense.
  As we are considering the future leadership of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, let us recommit ourselves to recognizing that we 
have responsibilities to advance these environmental issues and implore 
upon the Republican leadership to bring forward comprehensive 
legislation that, in fact, will make a significant difference on the 
trajectory of climate change here in the United States and will restore 
America's global leadership on this critically important issue.

remarks of my friend, the senior Senator from the State of Maryland, 
Mr. Cardin, both with respect to the vital importance of moving forward 
on climate change legislation here in the Senate and with respect to my 
opposition to the nomination of Mr. Wheeler. I think we need somebody 
at the head of the EPA who is going to make the issue of climate change 
and other vital environmental issues a priority.


                   Declaration of National Emergency

  Mr. President, I come to the floor with respect to another critical 
issue facing this Senate right now. I would just start by noting the 
fact that earlier this week, in this very Chamber, the senior Senator 
from Nebraska, Mrs. Deb Fischer, gave the annual reading of George 
Washington's Farewell Address, reminding all of us of the advice that 
our first President gave our country upon his resignation. He 
encouraged us to review the words of his farewell address frequently as 
the ``disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have 
no personal motive to bias his counsel.'' Those were the words of 
George Washington in his farewell address as he gave us all some 
warnings and admonitions.
  Maryland is particularly proud of the fact that President Washington 
resigned his military commission in Annapolis, in our Old Senate 
Chamber. Every year, in the Maryland Senate, where I once served, we 
honor President Washington for Presidents Day. One year, I had the 
honor of giving the commemorative address on that occasion, and I 
appreciate the fact that the U.S. Senate recognizes the extraordinary 
farewell address delivered by our first President. His words of warning 
have been prescient throughout history, from his caution against 
internal divisions, including geographic divisions between the North 
and the South, to the necessity of avoiding foreign entanglements that 
would imperil our own unity.
  At this particular moment in time, as we reflect on President 
Washington's Farewell Address, we have to do it in the context of the 
current President's extraordinary, unnecessary, and, I believe, totally 
unlawful declaration of emergency powers for the sole purpose of 
diverting taxpayer money, which has been previously appropriated by 
this Congress, to a different purpose, especially to build a wall along 
our southern border. In that context, we really need to reflect on the 
words of our first President and remember that our Constitution 
entrusts us, through article I, as a coequal branch of government, to 
do our duty under the Constitution.
  We know the history. We know that after winning our independence from 
England, President Washington, along with many of our other Founders, 
was concerned with the possibility of authoritarianism and of the 
critical need to build checks and balances into our political system. 
Here is the key warning in the farewell address on this score: ``The 
habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those 
entrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their 
respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the 
powers of one department to encroach upon another.''
  President Washington argued that this encroachment of one branch of 
government on the constitutional powers of another is a natural impulse 
and one that we must guard against as a self-governing people because 
of the ``love of power and proneness to abuse it,'' and that is why 
checks and balances are necessary to prevent it.
  He went on to write:

       The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of 
     political power, by dividing and distributing it into 
     different depositaries and constituting each the guardian of 
     the public weal against invasions by the others, has been 
     evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in 
     our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be 
     as necessary as to institute them.

  Now let's review what just happened here in our political system in 
the last couple of weeks. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump, after 
failing to achieve his desired outcome through the legislative process, 
through congressional action, decided that he would bypass the Congress 
by declaring


a national emergency in order to redirect funding to build the wall. 
This is a textbook example of the kind of power grab by an executive 
branch that George Washington warned us about in his farewell address.
  President Trump is claiming he has this authority pursuant to the 
National Emergencies Act of 1976, but a review of the legislative 
history of the National Emergencies Act demonstrates that it was passed 
not to expand Presidential power but to curb it. Three years earlier, 
Congress's Special Committee on the Termination of the National 
Emergency was created to end outdated emergency declarations and, 
according to the committee's report at the time, ``recommend ways in 
which the United States can meet future emergency situations with speed 
and effectiveness but without relinquishment of congressional oversight 
and control.'' That was what the special committee's report concluded, 
and that formed the basis of the legislation that followed.
  The National Emergencies Act gives the President very, very narrow 
and conditioned-based authority to declare an emergency and specify the 
steps necessary to confront it, and it gives Congress the authority, as 
we saw in the House just yesterday, to pass legislation to disapprove 
of and to terminate the emergency. Of course, it will also be subject 
to court review. I would suggest that it is not our job to pass laws 
which we know to be unconstitutional and simply leave it to the courts 
to reach the obvious conclusions. We have a responsibility here in this 
Chamber, not only under the Constitution but under the very statute the 
President proposes to use now for his declaration, to apply our 
authority and responsibility as a coequal branch of government.

  Now let's review the context of this decision. The President's 
interest in spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money for a wall 
along the southern border was not a secret to Congress. Of course, 
during the campaign--as a matter of his campaign pledges and as he 
continues to insist--he did say that at the end of the day, Mexico will 
pay for it. Yet, for the purposes of today, that is not the main point. 
The point is that the President had told this Congress that it was his 
intention to try to spend billions of dollars to build a wall.
  His original budget request to the Congress for the fiscal year that 
we are in was $1.6 billion. That was the budget request we got from the 
Senate Appropriations Committee. Then, last fall and last winter, in 
December, the President began demanding much higher amounts for the 
wall he wants to build. In fact, in his meeting with then-Democratic 
Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Leader Schumer on December 11, here 
is what the President said: If we don't get what we want, one way or 
the other, through you or the military or anybody else, yes, I will 
shut down the government.
  That was in December. What the President was saying was that if he 
doesn't get his appropriations--the budget request--through the 
Congress, he was going to shut down the government. He did, and he did 
that for 35 days. That was his constitutional prerogative not to sign a 
bill. It, obviously, caused great harm and dislocation around the 
country. It caused a lot of economic pain and a lot of personal 
financial pain to millions of Americans, but the President clearly had 
the authority to do that.
  As the Congress, we were aware of the President's position. He made 
it very clear. Then, after the government shutdown was over, of course, 
we passed that short-term piece of legislation to keep the government 
open for 3 weeks as we worked on a longer term budget plan.
  Around February 14 of this year, we passed a compromise budget bill--
a compromise appropriations bill. That bill provided $1.375 billion for 
55 miles of pedestrian and levee fencing along the U.S. border with 
Mexico. That bill passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 83 to 16, and it 
passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 300 to 128. As with 
most bills that pass the Congress with those kinds of bipartisan 
majorities that are compromises, it didn't have everything everyone 
wanted. It had some things in it that one side or the other may not 
have wanted, but it was a compromise, and it was made necessary to pass 
a bill to keep the government open. It was to make sure our 
constituents received the services of their government and to make sure 
that we met the needs of the country.
  On the very morning that we considered that bill here in the Senate 
Chamber, President Trump was considering his next steps. In fact, 
Majority Leader McConnell announced on the floor here that President 
Trump had told him that he was going to sign the bill but that he was 
also going to sign an emergency declaration to override the 
appropriations in the bill and divert those moneys to some other 
purpose that Congress had not authorized. In fact, while Senator 
McConnell was making that statement at the time we were considering and 
voting on the bill, it was not a surprise that the President had been 
considering it. He had been talking for weeks and threatening the 
Congress that if he didn't get the appropriations levels he wanted for 
the wall--if he didn't get the budget allocation he wanted--he was just 
going to declare a national emergency and do it himself. That was his 
threat.
  Clearly, he hoped that threat would force Congress to provide the 
extra moneys the President requested for the wall, but the Congress 
didn't do the President's bidding. We passed that compromise bill by 
those large bipartisan majorities. So what did the President do? Of 
course, he declared this emergency.
  I should note that even as he announced his emergency declaration in 
the Rose Garden, the President said: ``I could do the wall over a 
longer period of time. I didn't need to do this . . . but I'd rather do 
it much faster.'' That is what the President said at the time. He said 
he didn't need to do this, not in that way, but he wanted to do this 
quickly.
  Here is the thing. He didn't need to do it. He made it very clear 
that he decided to do it simply because he didn't get what he wanted 
from the U.S. Congress; that because we didn't do what the President--
what the Executive asked, heck, he was going to declare some emergency 
to divert money from areas the Congress had approved on a bipartisan 
basis to some other area the President wanted to spend money on, in 
this case the wall.
  Now, look, the Constitution is pretty clear. The President had the 
power to veto that bill. He, of course, had refused to go along with an 
earlier proposal, and that led to a 3-week government shutdown. The 
President could have done that again. That would have been in his power 
to do it, and of course the choice for the Congress at that point would 
have been whether to override the President's veto.
  If you look at the size of the votes that appropriations bill passed 
by--83 to 16 in the U.S. Senate and 300 to 128 in the House--he could 
have overridden the veto. That would have been the constitutional way 
for the President of the United States to try to get his way, but that 
is not what he did. He decided to do something different, declare an 
emergency in an unconstitutional way.
  The question we have to ask ourselves--and I am talking Republicans 
and Democrats, and I am talking about the Senate as an institution, the 
House of Representatives as an institution--is should this President or 
any other President--or any other President--be able to override an 
appropriations law to the tune of billions of dollars right after 
Congress has already expressed its position in a bill that we passed by 
overwhelming majorities or by any majority, a bill that passed.
  In declaring this alleged emergency, the President has announced his 
intention to divert $2.6 billion from the Department of Defense 
counterdrug activities. This is an ironic diversion, considering the 
President's stated concern, which I share, about drug trafficking.
  The Defense Department has indicated that those moneys the President 
is proposing to take from drug trafficking are being spent for that 
purpose and that only about $85 million remains in that account. So 
that means they are going to have to take other moneys from other 
Defense Department priorities, and the President has indicated they 
want to take $3.6 billion from military construction accounts--moneys 
that this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has already appropriated for 
those military construction projects.
  Article I is crystal clear. Article I of the Constitution vests this 
Congress--


this Senate and the House of Representatives--with the power of the 
purse.
  I have my handy, small Constitution right here, and I would just 
again like to remind our colleagues that it says: ``No money shall be 
drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by 
Law, and a regular statement and account of the receipts and 
expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to 
time.''
  So article I of the Constitution is very clear. It is the U.S. 
Congress that has the power of the purse and has the authority to 
direct taxpayer moneys to the priorities that we decide.
  I ask my colleagues whether they are prepared to relinquish that 
authority. In fact, I would make the point it is really not ours to 
relinquish because the Constitution is quite clear on this point.
  We all know that yesterday the House of Representatives took a vote 
to say the President is not able to use the particular law he used the 
other day to declare an emergency. This Senate is going to be voting on 
that soon, and we have to ask ourselves as Senators what kind of 
precedent we want to set.
  Do we want to adhere to our duties under the Constitution? Should any 
President be able to say, ``Oh, my goodness. I don't like what the 
Congress just did. I don't like the fact that the Congress, through 
their duly elected Representatives and duly elected Senators, didn't 
give me all the money I wanted for the wall, and so I am going to throw 
the Constitution out, and I am going to take money that the Congress 
proposed for one purpose, and I am just going to move it somewhere 
else''?

  I want my colleagues to think really carefully about the precedent we 
would be establishing if we allow that action to go unchecked.
  We were just having a conversation here on the floor, my colleague 
from the State of Maryland and others, about the dangers and risks of 
climate change. That is a real crisis. I believe we should be investing 
a lot more funds in building out our clean energy infrastructure.
  We may well have a future President, maybe sooner rather than later, 
who wants to do that. I just ask my colleagues whether they think that 
President should be able to declare a national emergency and spend 
money for that purpose even if this Congress has not appropriated the 
moneys for that purpose.
  The idea that the President of the United States--any President of 
the United States--is going to declare an emergency simply because he 
or she did not get the appropriations request they asked for is 
unprecedented. We have looked. There have been times when people have 
declared emergencies, but we were not able to find any time where we 
have a situation like this, where a President, who tried to get a 
certain appropriation for a certain purpose out of Congress, didn't get 
it and immediately turned around and asked for a national emergency to 
do what the Congress had just denied them the authority to do.
  Just this morning President Trump's adviser, Kellyanne Conway, was on 
``FOX & Friends'' and said the President had to act because Congress 
didn't. In other words, the President had to act because Congress, on a 
bipartisan basis, through its duly elected representatives, did not 
give the President of the United States, the Executive, what the 
Executive asked for. That is why the President gets to declare an 
emergency.
  That would create a lawless situation and a gross violation of our 
Constitution.
  She went on to say: ``It's failed to do its job since he has been 
President on securing the border, and it has failed to do its job for 
decades, and so he waited for them.'' In other words, because the 
President is dissatisfied with what the Congress did, he gets to tear 
up the Constitution and go his own way.
  Back in 1983, when President Reagan was frustrated with the Congress 
and its control of the budget, he received a letter urging him to 
declare a state of emergency over our Nation's finances. In response, 
President Reagan acknowledged his frustration but wrote: ``I don't 
believe the President has the power to declare an emergency short of 
war.''
  I urge my colleagues--I urge my colleagues--to be cautious in 
allowing any President to use or claim an emergency in order to 
undercut the clear division of power set forth in the Constitution 
between the legislative and the executive branch.
  Yesterday Leader McConnell was asked about the legality of President 
Trump's move, and the majority leader acknowledged he ``hadn't reached 
a total conclusion'' on whether President Trump is acting legally.
  Think about that. You have the majority leader acknowledging that the 
President may be acting unlawfully. I think it is pretty clear on its 
face for those who closely examine the Constitution and the power of 
the purse.
  I think we are all called upon not as Republicans or Democrats but as 
Americans and as Senators in this Chamber to do our job and reject what 
is clearly an unconstitutional power grab. We should not passively 
submit to these actions. We should think about what we are going to do 
in light of the precedent that is being set here, and I hope we will do 
our jobs.
  I will just close with another statement from President Washington's 
Farewell Address where he cautioned against allowing any one branch of 
government to claim excessive power, even with the best of motivations. 
``Let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one 
instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by 
which free governments are destroyed.''
  In my view, the President's actions are not for the good, but I know 
many of my Republican colleagues would agree with the ends the 
President seeks with respect to using more moneys to build a wall. I 
understand that is the position of our Republican colleagues, but what 
George Washington warned us about was--whether we like what the 
President is doing or don't like what the President is doing--if the 
President is diverting money away from the purposes this Senate and the 
House of Representatives directed to some other purpose this President 
or any other President may want that we have not authorized, that is a 
gross usurpation of power, and we should not allow it to happen.
  So I ask my colleagues, let's join together to do the business of the 
Senate, protect the Constitution, and do our jobs.

                      Nomination of Andrew Wheeler
",,2019-02-27
1315,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1527-2,15,Mr. UDALL,"  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I would associate myself with the comments 
of Senator Van Hollen, who I think hit the nail on the head when it 
comes to this overreach by the President.
  I rise in support of the growing calls for action on climate change 
that are echoing in every corner of this Nation.
  The science is overwhelming, the evidence is clear, and unless we 
take immediate action, we will lose our planet as we know it. There is 
nowhere that has more at stake than my home State of New Mexico and the 
Southwest, which are in the bullseye of global warming. Unless we act 
against greenhouse gas pollution, rising temperatures, drought, 
wildfires, deforestation, we will permanently harm our communities.
  Because I believe in climate science and because I believe we 
desperately need to act, I must strongly oppose the confirmation of 
Andrew Wheeler to lead our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency. 
Mr. Wheeler has consistently advocated for measures that would damage 
the environment, hurt public health, and do long-term injury to the 
economy, and his record on climate change and the record of his 
administration are simply disqualifying.
  Mr. Wheeler's nomination is among the worst in a long line of 
backward nominations by this President. For someone who wants to lead 
the EPA--the key word being ``protection''--Mr. Wheeler's priorities 
are upside down.
  Let's be blunt with the American people. Mr. Wheeler was not 
nominated to protect the environment and human health. He was nominated 
to unravel and undo the environmental protections that are now in 
place. He was nominated to stop any new environmental and public health 
protections from being initiated. He was nominated to go easy on those 
who violate existing environmental laws. He was nominated to stand in 
the way of climate science and climate action.


  So far, by these measures, he has been a great success for a 
President who mocks climate science and who denies that this 
existential threat even exists, but there is no success for the 
American people. Mr. Wheeler's nomination puts the American public at 
great risk, and we should firmly oppose making his appointment 
permanent.
  Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler's upside-down priorities don't end at 
climate change. In addition to actively resisting climate action, Mr. 
Wheeler is not looking out for the health and well-being of my 
constituents or protecting my State's most precious resource, our 
water. There, like in so many other parts of the country, fire foam 
used by the Air Force has contaminated groundwater with toxic chemicals 
known as PFAS. These chemicals are linked to various cancers, heart 
disease, and other ailments. Groundwater in and around Cannon Air Force 
Base, near Clovis, NM, is contaminated with PFAS.
  This is dairy country. One dairy is actually being put out of 
business because the PFAS is in groundwater and it has contaminated 
this farmer's water wells. The family that owns the dairy and its hard-
working employees have drank water from these wells for years.
  Will a Wheeler EPA put us in this situation? Will they help us out of 
it? During his confirmation hearings, he refused to commit to setting a 
drinking water standard. Then, later, we find out that he had already 
decided not to set standards for these toxic chemicals in December of 
last year. Under bipartisan pressure, he has since backed down and says 
EPA will set a standard--someday. I wouldn't hold my breath. In the 
meantime, millions of Americans and the dairies in eastern New Mexico 
are being hurt.
  Furthermore, Mr. Wheeler is a committed soldier in the long-running 
assault on science that President Trump has championed. One of my 
constituents, Celerah Hewes, wrote this week asking me to vote against 
this nomination. She writes:

       I grew up in Corrales, surrounded by farmland and fresh 
     air. I remember when the Rio Grande was full of water and the 
     ditches in the bosque flowed freely.
       Climate change and drought have forever changed the land I 
     call home and my daughter will not remember a time without 
     severe fire danger and ozone pollution.

  Celerah wants me to vote no because Mr. Wheeler ``is putting our 
children's health and future at risk.''
  According to the 2018 ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' we have 
12 years to turn this around for Celerah, her daughter, and the world. 
Soon, the impacts will become irreversible.
  The previous EPA set rules to reduce carbon pollution from 
powerplants by 32 percent by 2030. Mr. Wheeler's new plan will allow 
increased emissions from fossil fuel plants instead.
  He is no better when it comes to even modest standards for methane 
waste from oil and gas operations. Methane is an extremely potent 
greenhouse gas, 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the 
initial 20-year period. EPA's prior methane rules would have cut back 
methane pollution in a cost-effective way. Those regulations are out 
the window under Mr. Wheeler and replaced with loose rules, adding 
hundreds of thousands of tons of methane, volatile organic compounds, 
and toxins into the air.
  Climate change is the most significant threat facing our planet. The 
EPA is the Agency that should be leading the charge on tackling this 
threat, but Mr. Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the coal industry. 
Like so many other nominations, the President has again put the fox in 
charge of the henhouse. This time, the consequences could be disastrous 
and irreversible for our country and our planet. If we vote to confirm 
him, there will be little, if any, hope for climate action for the next 
2 years.
  Mr. Wheeler leaves no doubt whose side he is on. His record shows 
that, under his watch, big polluters will get off scot-free.
  Companies that pollute often try to reduce their cost of business and 
increase their profits by dumping that pollution and its costs on 
society as a whole. When environmental officials fail to enforce the 
rules against polluters, bad actors get an unfair advantage. Lax 
environmental enforcement is bad for American businesses that do the 
right thing and bad for taxpayers, who get stuck with the cleanup 
bills.
  Sadly, Mr. Wheeler's EPA is the poster child for lax enforcement. In 
2018, EPA collected the smallest amount of civil penalties against 
polluters since 1994. Inspections are half of what they were in 2010. 
EPA charged the fewest criminal defendants since 1991. It saw a steep 
drop in civil judicial enforcement cases as well. The bad news goes on 
and on.
  So the best that can be said of Mr. Wheeler's record is that he is 
not Scott Pruitt. As far as we know, he has not abused taxpayer funds 
or staff for a variety of luxurious perks or rented his house from a 
lobbyist. But the bar is so low that it is in the Capitol basement.
  Indeed, I believe that the EPA under this President has reached an 
all-time low. There is hardly even any pretense that their goal is to 
safeguard the environment and public health. They are actively damaging 
our environment and actively resisting action on climate change at a 
time when young people and so many others across New Mexico and this 
country are crying out for action. We simply must do better.
  So I will vote no, and I will urge my colleagues to consider the 
consequences of this nomination for their children, grandchildren, and 
beyond, and to vote no as well.

1321,GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2241-5,0,Ms. SHALALA,"  Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, in June 2016, a gunman opened fire in the 
Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people, including Jerry 
Wright, a Miami Heat fan who loved to dance.
  Jerry Wright's parents, Fred and Maria, know that their son's death 
was preventable but, more than that, that it was not unusual.
  Nearly 40,000 people die because of guns every year, and that is why 
Fred and Maria lead the local Moms Demand Action group in my district. 
I am so proud to learn from them and work with them on commonsense gun 
safety in Miami-Dade and around the country.
  By mandating universal background checks for every gun sale, we can 
be a step closer to ensuring that, when our children go to school, to 
concerts, to movie theaters, to clubs, they do so safely, they do so 
without worrying that this dance might be their last.
  Fred and Maria Wright aren't asking for an overhaul of the Second 
Amendment; they are just asking for the adoption of commonsense 
solutions.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in preventing firearms 
from falling into the wrong hands by supporting H.R. 8.

1327,SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2238-2,1,Mr. GARAMENDI,"  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House overwhelmingly passed 
the Natural Resources Management Act, including a provision sponsored 
by Senator Feinstein and me that would establish California's first 
National Heritage Area, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National 
Heritage Area.
  I want to thank my House colleagues from California, Representatives 
Matsui, DeSaulnier, McNerney, Thompson, Harder, Lofgren, and Bera, for 
their support as cosponsors of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
National Heritage Area Act, H.R. 357.
  I also want to thank Chairman Grijalva of the Natural Resources 
Committee for bringing the bipartisan public lands bill to the floor of 
the House following Senate passage earlier this month.
  I sponsored this legislation to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin 
Delta National Heritage Area since 2011 along with my colleague Senator 
Feinstein.
  A National Heritage Area designation will help conserve the 
California Delta, which I have had the great pleasure of calling my 
home for the last 40 years.


  This iconic working landscape is central to California's life and is 
the most productive watershed and delta in the Western United States 
and, indeed, from the coast of Alaska to Chile.
  Specifically, this legislation authorizes $10 million in Federal 
grants for


local development of cultural heritage issues, historic preservation, 
and working lands conservation projects.
  This Federal grant funding will be available for the next 15 years to 
support local governments, historical societies, and nonprofit 
organizations throughout the delta.
  Our National Heritage Area Act proposal is endorsed by the Delta 
Stewardship Council and the Delta Counties Coalition, consisting of 
Sacramento, Solano, Contra Costa, Yolo, and San Joaquin Counties, all 
of which represent the delta. It is also supported by the Delta 
Chambers of Commerce and Visitors Bureau, Restore the Delta, and the 
National Parks Conservation Association.
  California's Delta Protection Commission is charged with developing 
the management plan for the new national heritage area.
  Lastly, I want to address some of the persistent misconceptions about 
national heritage area designations, not only this new one but also 
those throughout the United States. Such designations do not affect 
individual property rights, water rights, landownership, or local land 
use decisions, nor does the designation affect hunting and fishing. 
Rather, the national heritage area program simply makes Federal grant 
funds administered by the National Park Service available for local 
projects.
  The national heritage area program and planning process is 
collaborative and voluntary, meaning that local groups, businesses, and 
landowners can choose to participate or not. I look forward to 
continuing to work with local governments, county governments, local 
businesses, communities, local action groups, and all others interested 
during the public management planning process.
  After nearly a decade of work, the President is expected to sign the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area Act into law. We 
thank all who supported the legislation and the local entities that 
have done so.
  This is truly a historic achievement for the entire delta, including 
the farming communities, the families, and the immigrant communities 
who have settled in the area over the last 150 years and generated the 
rich cultural and agricultural heritage.

1335,HONORING THE SERVICE OF EUROPEAN UNION AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES DAVID O'SULLIVAN UPON HIS RETIREMENT,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE216-2,0,Mr. COSTA,"  Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished 
service of European Union Ambassador to the United States, David 
O'Sullivan, who will retire his post at the end of the month after 
nearly five years of tireless advocacy for transatlantic unity. It has 
been my privilege to work alongside Ambassador O'Sullivan as we strive 
to secure our mutual interests in national security, trade, and foreign 
affairs.
  Ambassador O'Sullivan was appointed in November 2014, shottly after 
receiving the EU Transatlantic Business Award from the American Chamber 
of Commerce for his contributions to improving our economic ties with 
Europe. As Ambassador, he has devoted himself to strengthening the EU-
U.S. trade relationship and worked to ensure that other large economic 
powers play by the rules. In 2018, he promoted a trilateral approach 
between the EU, the U.S., and Japan to tackle the issue of Chinese 
overcapacity in steel manufacturing.
  In his four decades of public service for the European Union, 
Ambassador O'Sullivan has worked diligently for international 
cooperation. Prior to serving as Ambassador, he helped establish one of 
the world's largest diplomatic organizations, the European External 
Action Service, and served as its Chief Operating Officer from 2011 to 
2014. He held senior positions with the European Commission, including 
Head of Commission President Prodi's Cabinet from 1999 to 2000 and 
Secretary General of the European Commission from 2000 to 2005. In his 
capacity as Director General for Trade and Chief Negotiator for the 
Doha Development Round from 2005 to 2010, he secured numerous free 
trade agreements, including the conclusion ofthe EU's agreement with 
South Korea.
  Born in Dublin, Ireland, the Ambassador's interest in global politics 
and international affairs was first inspired by his father, Lieutenant 
General Gerry O'Sullivan, who served as Chief of Staff of the Irish 
Defense Forces. While his father served as liaison to the United 
Nations in the Congo in 1961, David attended elementary school in my 
state of California and later worked two summers as a YMCA camp 
counselor in Chicago.
  The bonds of friendship with our transatlantic allies are now more 
important than ever and must continue to be founded upon our shared 
values of democracy, respect for human dignity, and the rule of law. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing Ambassador O'Sullivan's enduring contributions to 
transatlantic unity and EU-U.S. trade relations. I thank him for his 
service and wish him a happy retirement.

1336,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE224,0,Mr. DeFAZIO,"  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, yesterday had I been present, I would 
have voted in strong support of S. 47, the Natural Resources Management 
Act. I was detained due to severe weather and cancelled flights in 
Oregon.
  S. 47 is a compilation of approximately 100 public lands and natural 
resources bills. One of the main provisions would provide permanent 
authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which I strongly 
support.
  Also included in this essential legislation are three provisions that 
I authored to protect critical salmon and steelhead habitats in 
southwestern Oregon and designate more than 30,000 acres of public land 
as Wilderness.
  H.R. 994, the Chetco River Protection Act, would prohibit new mining 
claims on various rivers and creeks in Southwestern Oregon. The waters 
protected by this legislation supply clean drinking water to thousands 
of residents of Southwest Oregon and Northwest California and are 
critical salmon habitat.
  H.R. 999, the Devil's Staircase Wilderness Act, would permanently 
protect Devil's Staircase, a remote, unspoiled area in the Coast Range. 
The legislation would designate approximately 30,500 acres of Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) lands as 
Wilderness. In addition, this legislation designates approximately 14.4 
miles of the Wasson and Franklin Creeks, which support native Coho and 
Chinook salmon, trout, and steelhead runs, as Wild and Scenic Rivers.
  H.R. 1056, the Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special 
Management Area Designation Act, would designate almost 100,000 acres 
of public land in the Steamboat Creek Watershed in the Umpqua National 
Forest that is vitally important steelhead habitat. The legislation 
would honor Frank and Jeanne Moore's lifelong efforts to protect the 
North Umpqua River and its tributaries.
  The lands protected in these bills are some of the most beautiful, 
pristine, and ecologically-diverse areas in Oregon. To leave these 
areas unprotected would be to subject them to pollution and mining, 
endanger drinking water for thousands of families, and devastate local 
recreation economies.
  I am proud that Congress overwhelmingly passed this legislation and 
that President Trump is expected to sign this important legislation 
into law.

1337,CELEBRATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE220-2,0,Mr. LIPINSKI,"  Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 200th 
anniversary of the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of Illinois. It is an honor to recognize a court with such a 
rich and impactful history at the heart of the American judiciary 
system.
  The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois traces 
its roots back to Illinois' establishment. Nathaniel Pope, serving as 
the Territory of Illinois' Secretary from inception in 1809, became its 
Delegate to Congress in 1816. There, he worked tirelessly on part of 
the territory's eventual admission to the Union as the state of 
Illinois in 1818. As such, it was only a natural progression for him to 
be nominated and confirmed as the first Judge of its new District, 
bringing with him strong anti-slavery views.
  Eventually, the United States District Court for the District of 
Illinois was subdivided into the Northern and Southern District Courts 
in 1855. The Northern District led by its first judge, Judge Thomas 
Drummond, continued the tradition of protecting the rights of all 
people. One such example, was through the sentencing of the 
abolitionist John Hossack, who had violated the Fugitive Slave Act by 
abetting a runaway slave. Judge Drummond, conflicted between his duty 
to the rule of law and his abolitionist conscience, recognized Hossack 
was guilty of breaking the law, but chose to hand down a minimal 
sentence for the transaction. Even as the Civil War raged on, Judge 
Drummond balanced his sense of duty and patriotism, actively supporting 
the Union and President Lincoln while still defending the Chicago 
Times' right to freedom of speech and criticism.
  Today the court exists as the Northern District of Illinois and is 
led by Chief Judge Ruben Castillo. It has grown considerably during its 
200 years and now contains 22 judicial posts, ensuring further public 
and juris prudential access to its resources and rulings. I am grateful 
to the District Court and its people, for laws are useless without 
justice.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on the 
200th anniversary of the courts establishment. Through its celebration, 
we pay tribute not only to our institutions and the rule of law, but to 
our long-standing history of justice.

Eva Moreno for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for 
Youth award.
   Eva Moreno is a student at Arvada High School and received this 
award because her determination and hard work have allowed her to 
overcome adversities.
   The dedication demonstrated by Eva Moreno is exemplary of the type 
of achievement that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It 
is essential students at all levels strive to make the most of their 
education and develop a work ethic which will guide them for the rest 
of their lives.

Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. I have no doubt 
she will exhibit the same dedication and character in all of her future 
accomplishments.

bipartisan National Resources Management Act. Congress has not enacted 
a public lands package of this scale since 2009, and passage of this 
bill will mark a major milestone for the conservation and future of 
America's public lands. This bill will permanently authorize the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, designate over 1 million acres of 
wilderness, and protect over 1 million acres of land from destructive 
practices.
  I have supported the Land and Water Conservation Fund for many years 
and since its creation, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped 
preserve America's outdoors heritage by supporting anglers and outdoor 
recreation for families in every state. Wisconsin alone has received 
$211 million in LWCF funding over the past five decades, helping to 
protect the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Ice Age National 
Scenic Trail, and North Country National Scenic Trail.
  I am proud that the package includes the Migratory Birds of the 
Americas Conservation Act, which reauthorizes the Neotropical Migratory 
Bird Conservation Act to help conserve migratory birds in rapid decline 
in Wisconsin and throughout the country. The Neotropical Migratory Bird 
Conservation Act provides more than $66 million in grants to support 
long term conservation, research, and habitat protection of migratory 
birds.
  As the founder and co-chair of the National Parks Caucus and longtime 
member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus and Congressional 
Sportsmen's Caucus, I am proud to support this legislation.

1342,"RECOGNIZING DALLAS GAY, GAINESVILLE ROTARY CLUB'S MAN OF THE YEAR",CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE218-2,0,Mr. COLLINS of Georgia,"  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Dallas Gay, a fellow Northeast Georgian who was recently named Man of 
the Year by the Gainesville Rotary Club in recognition of his work to 
combat the opioid epidemic in Georgia.
  Each year, thousands of Americans lose their lives to opioids. Mr. 
Gay understands the severity of this issue better than most, as he lost 
his grandson to a drug overdose in 2012. This tragic loss inspired him 
to join the fight and ultimately save countless lives throughout the 
state of Georgia.
  Mr. Gay has spearheaded several drug-
related campaigns, some of which have led to new legislation. In May 
2017, the Jeffrey Dallas Gay Jr. Act was signed into law, making 
naloxone--a life-saving antidote for drug overdoses--available over the 
counter. He also co-founded the ``Think About It'' campaign, which 
raised awareness of addiction to opioids and prescription drugs, and 
ultimately raised over $400,000.
  Mr. Gay was previously recognized by the Medical Association of 
Georgia and St. Jude's Children's Hospital for his work on the opioid 
epidemic.
  In his Man of the Year acceptance speech, he encouraged others to 
continue to ``be a soldier'' in combating this crisis and to question 
and safeguard the drugs which are prescribed to them.
  I thank Mr. Gay for his steadfast commitment to fighting this 
epidemic, and I look forward to witnessing his continued impact on 
countless lives across the state of Georgia.

1343,RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgS1527,0,Mrs. FISCHER,"  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today because in 1869, 150 
years ago, the Nebraska Legislature unanimously passed and our Governor 
signed legislation that established the University of Nebraska.
  The Morrill-Land Grant Colleges Act, signed into law by President 
Abraham Lincoln in 1862, provided Nebraska with land to establish 
colleges focused on agriculture and the mechanic arts. The university 
opened its doors in our State capital, Lincoln, where we honor 
President Lincoln's namesake.
  Since then, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has grown to an 
enrollment of over 25,000 students, providing over 5,000 new graduates 
to the workforce each year and over $2 billion in annual economic 
impact for Nebraska across our 93 counties.
  The university holds a special place in my heart. I am a graduate of 
the university. Staying true to its roots, UNL remains a national 
leader in water, agriculture, and rural development research, helping 
to transform our State, which was once called the Great American 
Desert, into one of the greatest agricultural exporting regions in the 
world.
  On top of equipping Nebraskans with the skills to feed the world, the 
university has emerged as a leading institution for early childhood 
education and national security and defense research.
  The university's sports teams unite our Nebraska communities, and 
they fuel our pride in our great State. Whether it is to cheer on our 
five-time national championship winning football team at Memorial 
Stadium or at the Devaney Center to support one of our State's 
treasures, the five-time national champion women's volleyball team, 
Lincoln is filled with a sea of Husker red on game days.
  What is more, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln leads the Nation 
with 333 Academic All-Americans across our Cornhusker sports teams.
  The university is also important to the culture of our State, 
showcasing some of the best of the good life--attractions such as the 
State Museum, which is the largest natural history museum in Nebraska 
or the Larsen Tractor Test and Power Museum or the East Campus Dairy 
Store known across our State for its wonderful cheese and, of course, 
ice cream.
  The university, like our State, has grown and accomplished much over 
the last century and a half, and that is why my colleague from Nebraska 
and I have introduced a Senate resolution recognizing UNL's 150th 
anniversary on February 15 of 2019.
  This is a formal way for this body to extend our congratulations to 
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on this special milestone in its 
history. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the resolution 
because, as my colleague and I know so well, there is no place like 
Nebraska.
  Here is to the next 150 years and beyond for the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln.

for her leadership and drawing attention to the 150th anniversary of 
the University of Nebraska. Senator Fischer is a tireless champion of 
our State and of this special university, her alma mater.
  I am sad to admit in public that I am not a graduate of the 
University of Nebraska, but I had lied about my age for many, many 
years to be able to vend and sell concessions at Huskers sporting 
events before I was old enough to do it so that I could be deeply 
affiliated with this institution, even though I didn't graduate from 
there.
  I salute my senior Senator and her leadership in drawing attention to 
this. I want to tell stories about Coach Osborne, who was my boyhood 
hero, about crying as a 12-year-old after the January 2, 1984, national 
championship game in Miami, about Scott Frost and how he is going to 
soon lead us back to the promised land, but I have already been warned 
by the Presiding Officer that the Senate has some informal unwritten 
rules that actually prohibit football evangelism on the floor.
  I will move along to celebrate, with my senior Senator, our 
volleyball national championships, our bowling national championships, 
and the fact that Nebraska is or was once known as the Great American 
Desert, and we are now the most trade-dependent, export-dependent State

Analena Shaw for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors 
for Youth award.
   Analena Shaw is a student at Arvada West High School and received 
this award because her determination and hard work have allowed her to 
overcome adversities.
   The dedication demonstrated by Analena Shaw is exemplary of the type 
of achievement that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It 
is essential students at all levels strive to make the most of their 
education and develop a work ethic which will guide them for the rest 
of their lives.
   I extend my deepest congratulations to Analena Shaw for winning the 
Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. I have no doubt 
she will exhibit the same dedication and character in all of her future 
accomplishments.

1352,"H.R. 4, THE VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT",CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE225,0,Ms. JOHNSON of Texas,"  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my support 
for H.R. 4, The Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA). The VRAA restores 
the protections and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) to its 
former strength after being gutted by the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder 
Supreme Court decision. The VRAA responds to the wave of voter 
suppression tactics enacted by states and localities since that 
decision, requiring states with a recent history of voter 
discrimination to seek federal preclearance for election changes.
  Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy and the fundamental right 
upon which all our civil liberties rest. In the previous two elections, 
we have seen an unprecedented increase in the engagement of voter 
suppression tactics. Specifically, in my home state of Texas, there 
have been ongoing suppression efforts, such as including additional 
obstacles for voter registration, cutbacks on early voting, and 
stricter voter identification requirements.
  The VRAA will counteract these unfair practices by requiring a 
nationwide, practice-based preclearance for ``known discriminatory 
practices,'' such as the creation of at-large districts, inadequate 
multilingual voting materials and cuts to polling places. The VRAA will 
also increase transparency by requiring reasonable public notice for 
voting changes. Finally, the bill will allow the Attorney General 
authority to request federal observers to be present anywhere in the 
country where a serious threat to voter access and fair elections 
exists.
  The reality is that we continue to see a number of significant 
obstacles to the free and fair exercise of the right to vote. Congress 
must do everything in its power to ensure that all Americans have the 
opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote. I support 
this critical legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
bill as well.

1353,INTRODUCTION OF THE HORSE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgE216-3,0,Mr. COHEN,"  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Horse 
Transportation Safety Act, a bill I introduced earlier today along with 
Representatives Peter King from New York, Dina Titus from Nevada and 
Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania, to ensure the humane and safe 
transportation of horses.
  The Horse Transportation Safety Act seeks to end the exploitation of 
a regulatory loophole designed to ban the transport of horses in 
double-deck trailers. This loophole gives drivers an incentive to 
inhumanely transport horses to assembly points then reload them into 
single level trailers just outside their final destination.
  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ``Double-deck 
trailers do not provide adequate headroom for equines, with the 
possible exception of foals and yearlings. We do not believe that 
trailers that have two or more permanent levels that are not 
collapsible can be adequately altered to accommodate adult equines, 
especially tall equines.''
  This practice is not only dangerous and inhumane to the horses, but 
to the traveling public, as well. We have witnessed the dangerous 
nature of these double decker trailers in several horrific accidents. 
In October of 2007, fifteen horses died when a double deck trailer 
carrying 59 Belgian draft horses overturned on Route 41 in Illinois. 
Unfortunately, we know that accidents like this are not an uncommon 
occurrence.
  The legislation is strongly supported by agricultural interests and 
animal protection groups including the Humane Society of the United 
States, the Animal Welfare Institute, the National Black Farmers 
Association, and Return to Freedom Wild Horse Conservation.
  Moreover, in 2010 the Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure 
unanimously adopted this bipartisan legislation.
  This is common sense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support 
the swift passage of the Horse Transportation Safety Act. I also want 
to express my gratitude for the many years of hard work on this issue 
by our esteemed colleague, the late Representative Walter Jones from 
North Carolina.

1354,GUN VIOLENCE,CREC-2019-02-27-pt1-PgH2241,0,Ms. DEAN,"  Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, for decades, lobbyists have stifled our 
national conversation about gun violence and Congress has refused to 
act.
  Since Parkland, Thousand Oaks, and so many others, new voices have 
broken through. Student activists have marched, organized--alongside 
moms--and insisted that we take their safety seriously.
  This week we do just that, by passing H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. This will 
be a sea change.
  And it shouldn't be controversial. Mr. Speaker, 97 percent of 
Americans support background checks--that is Democrats and 
Republicans--including 94 percent of gun-owning households.
  Six years ago, I was there when the Pennsylvania House Judiciary 
Committee held its first hearing on background checks.
  In her courageous testimony, Sandy Hook mother Francine Wheeler 
described losing her son Ben. She said:

       When this happens to you--when my child was murdered, I no 
     longer have the fear to stand up and to say what is right and 
     what I believe.

  And then Francine asked a crucial question:

       If we all agree dangerous individuals shouldn't have guns, 
     then shouldn't we at least take the most basic steps to make 
     sure they don't?

  I look forward to the passage of these bills.

  Mr. Ewell was born into poverty and grew up in Lancaster. He attended 
McCaskey High School and later went on to attend Penn State. He served 
his country for 4 years, from 1941 to 1945, during World War II.
  He became known as the fastest man in the world after he broke the 
world record for the 50-yard dash in 1940. He went on to win one gold 
and two silver medals at the 1948 Olympics in London.
  I know people who still recall cheering on the streets in Lancaster

our country and for our community.

highlight his story today.

Month, I rise to celebrate the life and contributions of a remarkable 
Detroit community activist.
  While I was at the Macomb County Celebration of Black Excellence last 
Saturday, the Michigan activist community received news of the loss of 
Mama Lila Cabbil.
  A close friend of Rosa Parks for 30 years, Ms. Cabbil was a national 
leader in the fight against racism and a powerful Detroit activist, 
particularly in the struggle for clean and accessible water.
  At Rosa Parks' funeral service in 2005, Ms. Cabbil invoked Matthew 
7:16: ``You shall know them by their fruits.'' When I read those words 
today, I think of Mama Lila's commitment to Michigan's Black community 
and to all communities that have suffered the theft of their voting 
rights and the unjust loss of their homes and their water.
  During Black History Month, it is my honor to highlight Mama Lila's 
contribution to Detroit and our region and the example she sets for all 
of us as a passionate servant leader.

1366,REINTRODUCTION OF THE RESTORING THE PARTNERSHIP FOR COUNTY HEALTH CARE COSTS ACT OF 2019,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE203-4,0,Mr. HASTINGS,"  Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill to 
restore the partnership between the federal government and counties for 
the health care costs of inmates who have not been convicted of a 
crime. This legislation will provide some relief to our nation's local 
economies, while strengthening the fundamental principles of our 
justice system.
  In almost all states, a person who is incarcerated in a county jail 
or juvenile detention facility loses their Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP or 
SSI benefits even if they have not been convicted of a crime. The U.S. 
Supreme Court's interpretation of the 8th Amendment requires government 
entities to provide medical care to all inmates. As a result, local 
governments are burdened with the expense of providing health care to 
thousands of men, women, and children currently awaiting trial.
  Providing health care for inmates constitutes a major portion of 
local jail operating costs. Requiring county governments to cover 
health care costs for inmates who have not yet been convicted of a 
crime places an unnecessary


burden on local governments, which have their fair share of widespread 
budget deficits and cuts to safety net programs and other essential 
services to deal with as it is.
  Terminating benefits to inmates who are awaiting trial undermines the 
presumption of innocence, which is a cornerstone principle of our 
justice system. The current practice does not distinguish between 
persons who are awaiting disposition of charges and persons who have 
been duly convicted and sentenced. Moreover, this reality 
disproportionately affects low-income and minority populations who are 
often unable to post bond, which would enable them to continue 
receiving benefits.
  Madam Speaker, my legislation addresses this problem by prohibiting 
the federal government from stripping individuals of their Medicare, 
Medicaid, and SSI benefits before the inmate has been convicted of a 
crime. It preserves the partnership between the federal and local 
governments and ensures that local governments are not burdened with an 
unfair share of meeting the constitutional mandate to guarantee medical 
coverage. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
commonsense bill that addresses a problem affecting communities all 
across the nation.

public service in the Bronx. She is a great example of the countless 
contributions that African Americans make to our Nation every day.
  Ms. Major previously served as the Bronx Representative on the Panel 
for Educational Policy of the New York City Department of Education. In 
addition, she volunteered for Bronx Community School District 11 for 
several years, and served as President of the District 11 Community 
Education Council. One of Ms. Major's greatest accomplishments has been 
serving on the Citywide Parent Commission on School Governance as a 
parent advocate to ensure that the voices of Bronx parents were heard 
in addressing school governance issues. She is still committed to 
addressing quality of education throughout the Bronx.
  A tireless and dedicated public servant, Ms. Major currently serves 
as the Director of Education and Youth Services for Bronx Borough 
President Ruben Diaz, Jr. She is a graduate of Baruch College and is a 
certified mediator. Ms. Major is also a member of the National Council 
of Negro Women, North Bronx Section. She is the mother of two and still

medicine have been made by African Americans in this country.
  The first open-heart surgery in the United States was successfully 
completed by Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, a Black man. Not only was he a 
pioneer of this lifesaving surgery, but also, in the late 1800s, he 
opened the country's first hospital with an interracial staff, 
Provident Hospital in Chicago.
  Then, in the 1930s, Dr. Helen Dickens did her internship at Provident 
Hospital before becoming the first Black woman admitted to the American 
College of Surgeons.
  And then, while Dr. Dickens was doing her internship at Provident, a 
young Black girl growing up in segregated Arkansas dreamed of becoming 
a doctor. Sixty years later, in 1993, Dr. Joycelyn Elders became 
America's first African American Surgeon General.
  Mr. Speaker, Black history is not something that is in the past. It 
is constantly unfolding. It is American history.

  THON is the accumulation of a yearlong fundraising effort to raise

the dedicated and hard-working small businesses that does so much for 
the State of Florida. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit. Today, it is my 
distinct pleasure to name Magellan Transport Logistics, of 
Jacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
  Founded in 2006, Magellan Transport Logistics is a Service-Disabled 
Veteran-Owned Small Business dedicated to providing its customers with 
a wide range of transportation needs. Tom Piatak founded Magellan 
Transport Logistics based on many of the same qualities that he learned 
while serving in the U.S. Army. A graduate of the U.S. Military 
Academy, Tom instills into the company the values he learned from West 
Point, as well as from his service as a combat engineer during 
Operation Desert Storm.
  Today, Tom serves as chief executive officer and chairman of 
Magellan. Under his guidance, the company has quickly become a leader 
in supporting the vast transportation needs of its clients. Tom and his 
team have gained much of their success by recruiting some of the most 
talented leaders and logistics professionals in the industry. By 
instituting four core values of entrepreneurship, ownership mentality, 
innovation, and transparency within the company, Magellan has created a 
positive culture that has translated into rapid growth and success. In 
March of 2018, Magellan announced the acquisition of a 47,000-square-
foot warehouse and the hiring of 100 employees over the next 5 years, 
furthering its investment in the Jacksonville community.
  Magellan is known for its dedication to its employees and as a pillar 
of the Jacksonville community. The company offers complete logistics 
and transportation services, both local and international, by truck or 
airplane, while also providing warehousing services and supply chain 
management. Magellan has built strong relationships with its clients by 
embracing the ``no man left behind'' principle that Tom learned during 
his time serving our country in the U.S. Army.
  As a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Magellan is 
committed to hiring veterans and participating in community service 
events to benefit America's veterans. This past December, Magellan 
sponsored 20 wreaths for National Wreaths Across America Day, as well 
as assisted with unloading and placing the memorial wreaths on the 
graves of fallen servicemembers. Magellan actively supports the Wounded 
Warrior Project, and their commitment to veterans in their community is 
a testament to the company's values.
  In addition to their continued service to our Nation's veterans, 
Magellan has also aided the community in disaster relief efforts. 
Following Hurricane Michael in the fall of 2018, Magellan


worked directly with FEMA, providing 40 trucks and three staff members 
as part of the disaster recovery effort. They also partnered with 
Operation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit organization, to deliver meals and 
supplies to families throughout impacted areas.
  Tom Piatak and Magellan are regularly honored for their success and 
dedication to the Jacksonville community. During the 2017-2018 NFL 
football season, the Jacksonville Jaguars honored Magellan as their 
Veteran Business Owner of the Week. The Jacksonville Business Journal 
recognized Tom and the team at Magellan for their efforts to hire 
veterans, and the Wounded Warrior Project awarded the company with the 
Wounded Warrior Certificate of Recognition in 2017.
  Tom Piatak's work to grow Magellan Transport Logistics while staying 
committed to his community and veterans represents the dedication to 
service for which Florida entrepreneurs are well known. Through hard 
work, Tom and his team at Magellan Transport Logistics have built a 
successful business grounded in strong values, while serving as an 
example of superior corporate citizenship. I would like to congratulate 
Tom and the entire team at Magellan Transport Logistics for being named 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look 
forward to watching their continued growth and success.

  During Black History Month, we especially remember the enduring 
contributions of great Americans like Dr. Scales, who is one of four 
Black teachers to integrate Winston-Salem schools.
  Dr. Scales worked in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools for 
over 20 years and spent nearly 30 years in various roles at Winston-
Salem State University. She brought the first Spanish programs to these 
schools and was known for her belief that every encounter was an 
opportunity to impact students in a positive way.
  Additionally, she served on numerous boards, including the YMCA of 
Northwest North Carolina, Delta Fine Arts Center, and Northwest Child 
Development Center.
  Dr. Scales passed away last month, but her legacy as a dedicated 
educator and selfless community leader will endure through the many 
lives she touched in her 91 years.

1388,REMEMBERING THE AURORA VICTIMS,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2087-4,0,Ms. UNDERWOOD,"  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, 10 days ago, five people, four of whom 
were my constituents, left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt 
Company in Aurora, Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken 
by an unspeakably horrible act, gun violence, which happens 
heartbreakingly frequently in this country.
  As we consider legislation this week that is a critical first step 
towards preventing gun violence, I would like to take a few moments to 
honor the lives our community lost this month.
  I wish to remember Russell Beyer. Proud chair of his union and a 20-
year employee of Henry Pratt, Russell was the father of two and a 
steadfast Patriots fan.
  We remember Clayton Parks, a Northern Illinois University grad whose 
wife, Abby, describes as an incredible father to their young son, Axel.
  We remember Josh Pinkard. ``I want to shout from the rooftops about 
how amazing Josh was,'' his wife, Terra, wrote about a man who loved 
God, family, and college football.
  We remember Trevor Wehner, a college student at Northern Illinois 
University, killed on the very first day of his internship. He was 
described by a friend as someone who would go out of his way for 
others.
  We remember Vicente Juarez. The patriarch of a tight-knit family, 
Vicente was a caring husband, father, and grandfather to eight. His 
neighbors loved him for his efforts ridding the neighborhood of 
dandelions each summer.
  We will never forget our five neighbors, and we will never forget the 
bravery of law enforcement and first responders who rushed toward the 
violence and undoubtedly saved countless lives.
  May we honor them with our actions, and may our community come back 
stronger than ever before.

1389,TRIBUTE TO ERNEST MATT HOUSE,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1429-2,0,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later this week, Leadership Tri-County 
from Knox, Whitley, and Laurel Counties in my home State will present 
one of its highest honors: the Leader of the Year award. I was 
delighted to learn this year's title will be given to Ernest Matt 
House, a lifelong resident of London, KY, and a remarkable example of 
entrepreneurship. I would like to take a few moments today to pay 
tribute to Ernest Matt and his many accomplishments in Kentucky.
  From an early age, Ernest Matt's talents were on full display. In 
high


school, he excelled both in the classroom and on the field, earning 14 
varsity letters and a place in the Kentucky High School Athletic 
Association's Hall of Fame, but these achievements, of course, were 
just the beginning. Ernest Matt received a full scholarship to play 
football at Eastern Kentucky University. There, he was EKU's starting 
quarterback for 3 years and lettered all 4. His notable time in the 
Colonel's uniform merited inclusion into the school's athletic hall of 
fame, and he still ranks among the best quarterbacks in its history.
  After his graduation, Ernest Matt returned to Laurel County and began 
working at his family's grocery store. Named for both of his 
grandfathers, he had big shoes to fill in the family business, but it 
didn't take long for Ernest Matt to learn the competitive business and 
set his sights on the future. Although a lot has changed in the grocery 
business and in the community, Ernest Matt holds onto the tradition of 
personal service that keeps bringing loyal customers back to the store. 
Over the next years, his continued entrepreneurial success earned him 
distinction both in the local community and across the Nation.
  Leadership Tri-County was established more than three decades ago to 
foster and develop emerging local leaders. Its programs in Kentucky 
invest in the men and women who have spent their lives making their 
communities a better place to live. This award is given each year to an 
individual who has contributed to the area's growth and development, 
and Ernest Matt clearly fits the bill. Through his business success and 
service on local, regional, and State board and commissions, Ernest 
Matt has quite a legacy of achievement.
  A man of deep faith, Ernest Matt credits his good works both to 
Christ and to his loving family, especially his wife Kim. I am sure 
she, along with his children and grandchildren, are quite proud of him. 
Kentucky has been made better because of Ernest Matt's many 
contributions, and I would like to congratulate him for being named the 
2019 Leader of the Year. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in 
recognizing his work.

1392,CHINA,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1413-2,0,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in a similar vein, on China, President 
Trump announced he would be delaying the imposition of higher tariffs 
on March 1, in the hopes of coming to a larger trade agreement. This is 
all well and good if the Trump administration ultimately achieves a 
strong deal that makes progress on China's rapacious trade policies. 
But we are not there yet, and my message to President Trump is don't 
back down.
  The President has shown the right instincts on China many times. I 
give him credit for that. I have praised him publicly for that, but at 
other times, I believe his eagerness for the appearance of 
accomplishment gets the best of him. Recent history has taught us that 
when President Trump makes unilateral concessions to China--as he did 
when he interfered in the sanctions against ZTE--China does very little 
for us in return.
  President Trump must not make the same mistake again, whether by 
interfering in the U.S. criminal charges brought against Huawei or 
otherwise decreasing our leverage, until and unless China makes 
meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable agreements to end its theft of 
American intellectual property and other trade abuses.
  Hopefully, that is where the negotiations are headed. If the 
President does


a good job, I will be the first to praise him. If he backs off or takes 
some temporary measure in decreasing the balance of trade but doesn't 
change China's structural rapaciousness against the United States and 
our intellectual property and our industrial know-how, he will be 
criticized by me and many others on both sides of the aisle.

1396,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,3,Mr. NEWHOUSE,"  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to lead a Special 
Order alongside my colleagues to discuss, frankly, a reckless and 
misguided and radical proposal recently introduced by some of my 
Democratic colleagues, the Green New Deal.
  Tonight, together with many of my fellow members of the Congressional 
Western Caucus, we will be taking the time to share with the American 
people the details of the ill-advised and bizarre provisions included 
in this green manifesto and the grave impacts that they would have on 
our Nation's economy.


  We will also share what we, as Republicans in the people's House, 
believe when it comes to our national strategy to innovate, diversify, 
and strengthen America's energy sector.
  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal is a bad deal for the American 
people. This so-called deal calls for cutting of greenhouse gas 
emissions to net zero in only 10 years.
  And while many studies are still working to grasp the perilous 
impacts and the enormous costs of this proposal, one independent 
estimate, led by a team of Stanford engineers, suggests it would cost 
our Nation in the neighborhood of $7 trillion to convert all of 
America's power to renewable power sources.


  To quote the former Secretary of Energy under President Obama, Ernest 
Moniz, he said: ``I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go 
to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It is just impractical.''
  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal goes much further than just the 
energy sector, however. It also mandates the guarantee of a job for 
everyone, paid vacations for everyone, free college for everyone. It 
dictates that every existing building in this country must be upgraded 
and retrofitted for ``comfort.''
  It calls for a drastic overhaul of our transportation systems across 
the country, threatening not only our trucking and airline industries, 
but also the daily lives of the 85 percent of Americans who drive every 
morning or evening to get to work.
  Mr. Speaker, while calling for all of these implausible mandates, the 
Green New Deal would also insert the Federal Government into seemingly 
every aspect of our daily lives.
  By expanding our Federal bureaucracy far beyond anything we have ever 
seen in history and undermining the federalist principles our country 
was founded upon in the Constitution, this proposal would jeopardize 
the future of America as we know it. It would sacrifice the American 
energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors; jeopardize 
businesses small and large across the Nation; and lead our country down 
the path of socialist nations like Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba.
  As the Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said after reading the 
proposal: ``What in the heck is this?''
  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more.
  My State, the great State of Washington, consistently ranks among the 
top of the list of States with the cleanest energy production. Do you 
know why that is? It is because of the strong reliance on our 
incredible system of hydroelectric dams, many of which are in my 
congressional district along the Columbia and the Snake Rivers.
  Nearly 70 percent of our power comes from hydropower, a clean, 
renewable, reliable, and affordable source of baseload energy.
  It also comes from our use of nuclear power. The Columbia Generating 
Station, which is also in the Fourth Congressional District which I 
represent, is the only nuclear power plant in the greater Northwest 
region. It too provides clean, reliable power for the Pacific 
Northwest.
  On top of these sources, Washington State uses a variety of other 
energy sources, including natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and biomass.
  It is because we use an all-of-the-above mix of energy sources, but 
largely concentrated on clean, renewable, reliable hydropower, that 
Washington State continues to demonstrate how we can lead in the use of 
clean energy while still diversifying and thereby strengthening our 
energy portfolio.
  Unfortunately, the Green New Deal negates this ability to do so. Not 
once is the word ``hydropower'' mentioned in the legislation. And in 
the frequently asked questions document that was released to accompany 
the introduction of the Green New Deal, it stated that ``The plan is to 
transition off of nuclear.''
  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to continue to strengthen America's 
energy independence and increase our use of clean sources of energy, we 
must absolutely include hydropower and nuclear power. The science says 
so, the facts say so.
  So when Democrats in Congress release a sweeping, colossal overhaul 
of our Nation's energy policies and do not include these clean energy 
sources, it is clear that this is far more about politics and not about 
sound science.
  Mr. Speaker, my fellow House Republicans and I continue to advocate 
for sound, comprehensive approaches to energy policy. We must continue 
to explore every opportunity to develop viable alternative energy 
sources, which is why under Republican control of the House in recent 
Congresses, we have made serious investments in advanced nuclear and 
basic science research, grid-scale energy storage, and equipped our 
national laboratories with robust resources to lead the way in 
research, development, and innovation.
  National laboratories, like the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory 
in my district, play a crucial role in developing the basic science 
research needed to pave the way for these alternative sources. Then 
when private industry can utilize this research, the open marketplace 
can put these new sources to use.
  That is exactly what our country needs: more collaboration, more 
innovation; not a top-down mandated system of bureaucratic dictates 
based upon a green manifesto.
  Mr. Speaker, I often share with my constituents that as a third 
generation farmer, I consider myself to be a conservationist and on the 
front lines of being a good steward of our natural resources. I know 
that we must respect our environment, we must ensure clean air and 
clean water for our citizens, and we must encourage innovative ways to 
produce energy through a variety of reliable, renewable traditional and 
alternative sources.
  Tonight I am looking forward to hearing from my friends and my 
colleagues in the Congressional Western Caucus on why the Green New 
Deal would be catastrophic for their constituents and what we in our 
Nation's capital should really be prioritizing in order to continue 
America's energy independence dominance.

  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my first speaker, the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the gentleman that represents the Eighth 
District of that great State.",N000189,2019-02-25
1397,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,4,Mr. STAUBER,"  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in 
opposition to the Green New Deal.
  This disastrous plan, cooked up by out-of-touch Washington elites, 
simply does not work for Minnesota families.
  According to the Energy Information Administration, 68 percent of 
Minnesota's energy consumption comes from a combination of coal, 
natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, and gasoline, all of which are to be 
banned completely by the Green New Deal in 10 years.
  Allowed under this radical pipe dream are wind, solar, and biomass, 
which barely account for 15 percent of Minnesota's energy consumption.
  Picture a family in Ely, Minnesota, where wind chill temperatures 
reached 71 below zero this January, waking up in a warm house heated by 
natural gas.
  They start a hot pot of coffee, powered by our affordable electric 
grid; take a hot shower, again, heated by natural gas; drive their kids 
to school in their van, powered by reliable, affordable gasoline; go to 
work, possibly at a mine or a local hospital; drive home again in that 
same gasoline-powered car; make dinner for their family, using their 
gas-powered stove; and then wake up again and do it all over.
  The little things that we take for granted every day are powered by 
conventional energy.
  The Green New Deal would have a severe impact on our everyday lives, 
something that northern Minnesotans do not want or need.
  The Green New Deal would force every Minnesota family to turn in 
their cars for electric vehicles and retrofit their homes to run on 
renewable sources, like solar or wind.
  I understand elites from D.C. and New York City may love this plan, 
but I know the reality. I encourage my colleagues, especially those who 
support this plan, to go back to their districts, like I did last week 
and really listen to their constituents, listen to their concerns, 
listen to how this plan would devastate the middle class and devastate 
hardworking Minnesota families.
  Retrofitting homes, buying electric cars, and ending the mining, 
airline, and much of the shipping industries may be fun ideas for the 
ultra-wealthy, but I know what it really means for middle-class 
families in northern Minnesota.
  We cannot let these unrealistic ideas get in the way of actual 
progress. We must develop renewable forms of energy, but at the same 
time, not shut out conventional, affordable energy sources on which 
millions rely.
  Do not let the Green New Deal distract from what northern Minnesotans 
care about: expanding rural broadband for better internet access, 
bringing good paying jobs back to our communities, and protecting 
Social Security and Medicare.
  With the projected cost of tens of trillions of dollars, the Green 
New Deal puts all of this at risk.
  I will not risk the future of Medicare and Social Security. I will 
not risk the future of middle-class families.


  However, I will stand up for the farmers, our miners, our small 
business owners, manufacturers, and workers threatened by this Green 
New Deal.",S001212,2019-02-25

Minnesota for expressing so eloquently how Americans around the country 
would be affected by this if this legislation was adopted into law. 
People from different parts of the country with extreme weather, as you 
have heard, depend on reliable sources of energy.
  From minus 71 to hopefully a little warmer climate, the next speaker 
I am going to yield to is the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the 
chairman of our Western Caucus and the representative from the Fourth 
Congressional District.",N000189,2019-02-25
1399,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,6,Mr. GOSAR,"  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Washington, for organizing this important Special Order on the Green 
New Deal.
  Mr. Speaker, America's energy renaissance is the backbone of our 
economy. It is a story of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.
  After decades of reliance on other countries to meet our energy 
needs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that America 
will export more energy than it imports starting in 2020. We are no 
longer dependent on volatile foreign sources produced in Russia or 
Saudi Arabia.
  Recent innovation and technology improvements associated with 
fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed shale resources, 
previously deemed uneconomical, to be developed, and are the main 
reason the U.S. was the world leader in carbon emissions reductions in 
2015, 2016, and 2017.
  That is right. Fracking, demonized by environmental extremists 
without justification, has proven to be the best energy solution for 
our environment.
  Abundant oil and natural gas has reduced electricity bills, kept gas 
prices low, and provided the largest share of U.S. electric power 
generation in recent years.
  The oil and gas industry supports more than 10.3 million jobs and 
nearly 8 percent of our economy.
  The United States is the world's top energy producer, and the 
American Dream is thriving.
  January 2019 saw the hundredth consecutive month of positive jobs 
growth in America, the longest period of continuous jobs growth on 
record.
  The U.S. job market is strong, and in December, employers posted 7.3 
million open jobs, a new record.
  Now, despite America's energy renaissance and the aforementioned 
emissions reductions, we continue to hear hyperbolic statements about 
pending climate catastrophe and the need for radical change to stave 
off future disaster.
  The Democrat socialists pushing the Green New Deal want to get rid of 
all energy sources except wind, solar, and batteries by 2030. How are 
we going to do that when wind and solar only produced 7.6 percent of 
our electricity in 2017?
  The Green New Deal would drive energy production and jobs to 
countries like China and India that have much worse environmental 
standards. Global greenhouse gas emissions will increase as a result, 
in direct contradiction to the main talking point of the Green New 
Deal.
  The socialist Green New Deal says it will provide higher education, 
higher quality healthcare, and affordable, safe, and adequate housing 
to all.


  The Mercatus Center estimates that the cost of the single-payer 
healthcare provision alone would cost $32 trillion in the first 10 
years, something that I think is probably on the low side.
  The Green New Deal is an alarmist pipe dream that seeks to 
fundamentally transform America without a blueprint. This socialist 
manifesto changes by the day, and important details on how a transition 
of the Green New Deal's magnitude will occur are missing, including how 
we will pay for this pie in the sky aspiration.
  If one needs to have more evidence that the Green New Deal is not 
plausible, look no further than the country of Australia where 
electricity prices are the highest in the world and the Aussies' 
obsession with renewables has destroyed their electric grid. Mass 
blackouts and mass power cuts are the new norm, and a massive Tesla 
battery backup system ran dry this past month as the Aussie power grid 
crashed in summer temperatures. Ninety thousand Aussie homes had no 
air-conditioning for the next 2 weeks of blistering heat.
  Let's learn from Australia's mistakes. Let's not repeat them.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to enlightening everyone on this 
legislation further in the coming days.",G000565,2019-02-25
1400,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,7,Mr. NEWHOUSE,"  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Arizona 
for expressing his thoughts on how this would impact the people not 
only in Arizona, but also around the country.
  Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents continue to ask me what is 
actually in this Green New Deal legislation. Unfortunately for the 
American people, the Members of Congress who introduced the resolution 
had, I guess, several hiccups along the way during their rollout and 
released conflicting documents to accompany the bill.
  One significant piece of legislation that my constituents have asked 
me about is whether the related resolution mandated a job for everyone 
in the United States. Well, that is, in fact, true. A part of the 
frequently asked questions document that was released with the 
legislation even stated that economic security would be provided for 
those who are ``unwilling to work.'' Many of my constituents think that 
is an amazing statement.
  After an adviser to the Green New Deal accused Republicans of 
doctoring this document, The Washington Post later reported that he 
erroneously made that accusation. In fact, this document was released 
by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's office.
  Representative Ocasio-Cortez has since retracted the frequently asked 
questions document, but the message I hope my constituents and the 
American people hear clearly is that we know the motives behind this 
legislation. We know the intent. From ending the airline industry to 
shutting down all nuclear power, unfortunately, some people on the 
other side of the aisle, my colleagues on the Democratic side, are 
threatening the American economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the frequently asked questions 
document that was released by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's office.

       We will begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to 
     put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this 
     resolution (important to say so someone else can't claim this 
     mantle).
       This is a massive transformation of our society with clear 
     goals and a timeline.
       The Green New Deal resolution a 10-year plan to mobilize 
     every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since 
     World War 2 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and 
     create economic prosperity for all. It will:
       Move America to 100% clean and renewable energy
       Create millions of family supporting-wage, union jobs
       Ensure a just transition for all communities and workers to 
     ensure economic security for people and communities that have 
     historically relied on fossil fuel industries
       Ensure justice and equity for frontline communities by 
     prioritizing investment, training, climate and community 
     resiliency, economic and environmental benefits in these 
     communities.
       Build on FDR's second bill of rights by guaranteeing:
       A job with a family-sustaining wage, family and medical 
     leave, vacations, and retirement security
       High-quality education, including higher education and 
     trade schools
       Clean air and water and access to nature
       Healthy food
       High-quality health care
       Safe, affordable, adequate housing
       Economic environment free of monopolies
       Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to 
     work
       There is no time to waste.
       IPCC Report said global emissions must be cut by 40-60% by 
     2030. US is 20% of total emissions. We must get to 0 by 2030 
     and lead the world in a global Green New Deal.
       Americans love a challenge. This is our moonshot.
       When JFK said we'd go to the by the end of the decade, 
     people said impossible.
       If Eisenhower wanted to build the interstate highway system 
     today, people would ask how we'd pay for it.
       When FDR called on America to build 185,000 planes to fight 
     World War 2, every business leader, CEO, and general laughed 
     at him. At the time, the U.S. had produced 3,000 planes in 
     the last year. By the end of the war, we produced 300,000 
     planes. That's what we are capable of if we have real 
     leadership
       This is massive investment in our economy and society, not 
     expenditure.


       We invested 40-50% of GDP into our economy during World War 
     2 and created the greatest middle class the US has seen.
       The interstate highway system has returned more than $6 in 
     economic productivity for every $1 it cost
       This is massively expanding existing and building new 
     industries at a rapid pace--growing our economy
       The Green New Deal has momentum.
       92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans 
     support the Green New Deal
       Nearly every major Democratic Presidential contender say 
     they back the Green New Deal including: Elizabeth Warren, 
     Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Jeff Merkeley, Julian Castro, 
     Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, and Jay 
     Inslee.
       45 House Reps and 330+ groups backed the original 
     resolution for a select committee
       Over 300 local and state politicians have called for a 
     federal Green New Deal
       New Resolution has 20 co-sponsors, about 30 groups (numbers 
     will change by Thursday).

great State of Arizona (Mr. Biggs), who represents the Fifth District 
and I believe served on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee 
very well.",N000189,2019-02-25
1402,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,9,Mr. BIGGS,"  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and give my thanks and gratitude to 
the gentleman from Washington for his efforts in leading this today, 
and to the Congressional Western Caucus and the members who are 
exposing what is really not a Green New Deal, but really is a green 
socialist manifesto.
  Here is what we need to understand about this. This is so broad and 
expansive, as Mr. Newhouse has said, it will, basically, invade every 
aspect of every American's life, and it will cost tens of trillions of 
dollars to implement.
  How will we pay for that? We are going to pay for that with crushing 
new taxes on individuals, families, and companies. We are going to 
destroy the current foundation of our entire American economy.
  There will be more borrowing, not just from the public sector, but 
from the private sector. The public sector is in trouble because the 
Federal Government just hit $22 trillion of national debt.
  The question is, what will the impact of this be on the environment? 
It would do little to solve the alleged problem of carbon in the 
atmosphere because the United States is no longer the primary source of 
carbon emissions.
  Between 2005 and 2017, our Nation has reduced CO2 
emissions by 862 million tons. Today, the U.S. is responsible for only 
15 percent of global CO2 emissions. During roughly the same 
period, China increased its emissions by 4 billion tons and India by 
1.3 billion tons.
  Needless to say, the GND doesn't explain how we would compel other 
nations to change their behavior. But domestically, as I have said, we 
are going to emasculate our economy. The coal, nuclear, natural gas, 
petroleum, and air travel industries will be wiped out, and all of the 
industries that support those industries. That means hundreds of 
thousands of people will lose their jobs almost instantly.
  At the same time, the Green New Deal, or the green socialist 
manifesto, is going to guarantee a wage. It is going to guarantee 
income for everyone.
  As Representative Ryan said, we can't green the economy without the 
power of the free market system. He is right. That is the ultimate 
point of what I want to say today.
  We know that science doesn't support the green socialist manifesto, 
but we know something that is really critical to understand. This 
proposal, which today is so vast, so encompassing, and so primitive in 
its creation, is also so destructive to our economy and multiple 
industries, multiple sectors of our economy, that I would say there is 
only one way that you can implement such an outlandish and reckless 
idea, and that is to use the awesome, overreaching power of government 
to not just induce, but to coerce implementation of this faulty idea.
  In its scope, breadth, and depth, this plan is authoritarian in 
nature. It will require government flexing its muscles to mandate 
activities and forbid other actions in every American's life.
  We can't afford this plan. This plan will not provide what it says it 
is going to do. Moreover, in a free, constitutional Republic, you can 
never allow this kind of socialism to be combined with 
authoritarianism.",B001302,2019-02-25

on the direction that this would take our Nation and the dangerous path 
it would lead us upon. Those are things that we need to make sure that 
we don't allow happen, and I think the American people would agree with 
us.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the 
good doctor from Kansas' First District who serves on the Agriculture 
Committee. I know this is going to have a huge impact on many 
industries, but particularly agriculture.",N000189,2019-02-25
1404,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,11,Mr. MARSHALL,"  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I must admit that, back home, the Green New Deal means 
that John Deere dealers are having a new combine sale.
  I stand before you this evening to tell you exactly why the Green New 
Deal is a sham. Rather than setting realistic goals to reduce carbon 
emissions and incentivize cleaner energy development, this so-called 
deal stalls innovation and drastically expands government involvement 
in almost every aspect of everyday life, at a price tag of more than 
$50 trillion.
  Over the past 2 years, we have unleashed our economy by reducing 
government overregulation, allowing more Americans to invest in their 
families, futures, and pursuits. The Green New Deal will throw the 
brakes on our economy, as well as the world's economy. Nothing will 
increase worldwide carbon production more than a stalled economy.
  Additionally, this Green New Deal reverses our success by imposing 
harsher regulations that will put American workers and American 
companies at an extreme disadvantage. This socialist proposal that 
Democrats are championing completely ignores the cost to American 
taxpayers and fails to address the negative impacts that other 
countries have on global climate change. It implements policies that 
will dramatically increase taxes, burdens, and energy bills for 
families.
  This deal will absolutely devastate our economy with its outrageous 
demands for new green infrastructure, new green labor practices, and 
new green taxes. It will crush American manufacturing and 
transportation industries. It would completely halt domestic energy 
production that has had record exports under the Trump administration.
  I am a firm believer that we must focus on leaving this world better 
than we found it for the next generation. For my children, for your 
children, and for our grandchildren, we need to be good stewards of the 
resources and the planet we have been given, but any reasonable 
solution will require us to use common sense when approaching the 
issues.
  We must also be careful not to fall into the trap of believing that 
the U.S. Government is the answer to correct all our problems. America 
has always been a nation of innovators, and instead of imposing new 
regulations and taxes, we must continue to lead the world and partner 
with American industries to develop creative solutions and new 
innovative technologies. Innovation will do more to impact climate 
change than any law Washington, D.C., can write.",M001198,2019-02-25
1405,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,12,Mr. NEWHOUSE,"  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Marshall for sharing with us 
his thoughts from the great State of Kansas.
  Some of the proponents of the Green New Deal have criticized others 
for criticizing the Green New Deal, saying that we don't have any room 
to talk if we are not going to offer something toward the issues that 
we face as a world and as a country.
  Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, we do have options, and we do have 
solutions


that we have been offering. Let me share a piece written by my 
Republican colleagues just recently who lead the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. Mr.   Greg Walden, Mr. Fred Upton, and Mr.   John Shimkus 
shared an article that was published in several newspapers around the 
country. Some of the things that they say go like this: ``America's 
approach for tackling climate change should be built upon the 
principles of innovation, conservation, and adaptation. Republicans 
have long championed realistic, innovative, and free-market strategies 
to promote a cleaner environment and to reduce emissions. The results 
are clear: The United States is leading the world in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions thanks to vibrant energy sector competition 
and innovation.''
  They go on to say: ``We should continue to encourage innovation and 
renewable energy development. We should promote carbon capture and 
utilization, renewable hydropower, and safe nuclear power, which is 
emissions-free. We should also look to remove barriers to energy 
storage and commercial batteries to help make renewable sources more 
viable and our electricity grid more resilient. And we must encourage 
more research and business investments in new clean energy 
technologies. These are bipartisan solutions that we must seize on to 
deliver real results for the American people.''
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud) from the 
27th District.

1406,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,13,Mr. CLOUD,"  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
Newhouse).
  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal is a bad deal for the people of 
America. Just days ago, we passed $22 trillion in debt for which we 
have no plan to begin paying off. The Green New Deal would only add 
trillions more while simultaneously destroying the American economy, 
which not only means families across our Nation would lose their 
ability to sustain themselves, but it would also shut down the 
innovation engine of the world.
  The 27th District of Texas, which I represent, has a better approach. 
We are home to a diverse energy portfolio, which includes wind, 
nuclear, LNG, oil production--not to mention our fair share of cows and 
airplanes.
  We are home to a safe, reliable nuclear power plant in Matagorda 
County that generates 2.7 gigawatts of power, and that is a power of 
nearly 2 million Texas homes and businesses. It would take 8.4 million 
solar panels to replace that kind of energy. Even President Obama's 
Secretary of Energy said, ``It's just impractical.''
  We are also home to the leading export energy port in the Nation. We 
have been a great part in the success of what we have seen as a nation 
of going from an energy-dependent nation to an energy-dominant nation. 
And what that new American energy dominance means, it means global 
stability and peace in the world as our allies are able to buy energy 
from us rather than from countries who don't have our best intentions 
in mind.
  But as the world's need for energy grows, American companies are more 
likely to care about being good stewards of our creation compared with 
those from other energy-producing nations.
  The United States cut carbon emissions by 14 percent since 2005 while 
global emissions rose 26 percent over the same period. Of all the G20 
countries, we have the best record recently on carbon emissions and 
reductions.
  In Texas our market-based approach to energy is leading the way even 
as our economy continues to boom. Furthermore, a thriving economy is 
absolutely essential to creating and deploying the innovative solutions 
we need to face the environmental challenges of the future.
  So when it comes to the Green New Deal, let's stop looking to 
socialism for answers and start looking to places like Texas.
  This Green New Deal would be devastating to American jobholders, 
harmful to our allies around the world, and it is also 
counterproductive to advancing protections to our environment.
  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to firmly oppose this outlandish and 
unrealistic idea.",C001115,2019-02-25

Cloud) for giving us great thoughts about the impacts of what the Green 
New Deal would actually mean for Americans and jobs in the United 
States of America.
  As the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) makes his way to the 
microphone, I just want to share with you one study that was released 
today by the American Action Forum. It says that the Green New Deal 
will cost a startling $93 trillion over 10 years.
  Now, put that into perspective: That is equivalent to $600,000 per 
household.
  To generate $93 trillion in income tax revenue, we would have to tax 
every household earning more than $30,000 at a 100 percent rate for 10 
years.
  If every household earning over more than $200,000 were taxed at 100 
percent for 10 years, it would still fall $58 trillion short. So you 
can just see that this does not work.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), a 
member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.",N000189,2019-02-25

Newhouse).
  You know, those numbers are just shocking, as you related, in terms 
of how it would devastate the American economy and American families.
  Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to add my voice in opposition to this so-
called Green New Deal.
  You know, this outrageous proposal would be a massive government 
takeover of every facet of our daily lives. From how we eat, to how we 
travel, this so-called Green New Deal calls to replace every building 
and car in America within 10 years. It would cost up to $93 trillion. 
That would cost every American household an extra $65,300 per year.
  That might be crumbs in New York and California, but it is not in 
Kansas, where the average family income is $56,422.
  If the crushing tax increase on every family isn't bad enough, the 
plan also calls for an eventual end to air travel.
  As representative of the Air Capital of the World, clearly, this is 
alarming.
  According to the Kansas Department of Transportation, aviation is 
responsible for 91,300 jobs in Kansas and has an economic impact on our 
state of $20.6 billion.
  Grounding air travel would decimate jobs in Kansas, just as the 
entire Green New Deal would devastate the economy of our country.
  The only thing this proposal accomplishes is exposing the priorities 
of politicians who are determined to increase taxes and expand 
government to impose their agenda on every family, farm, and business.
  Kansans know how to protect our environment and quality of life 
without being told to do so by government officials in Washington, 
D.C., and I stand with them in opposing this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Newhouse for leading this special 
order.",E000298,2019-02-25
1409,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,16,Mr. NEWHOUSE,"  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
Estes). I appreciate very much him sharing his thoughts about the Green 
New Deal and the impacts it would have on our country--something that 
we just absolutely cannot afford. So I appreciate very much his time 
this evening, and I thank him.
  Mr. Speaker, I recently read an article from Reuters titled ``Labor 
Unions fear Democrats' Green New Deal poses job threat.''
  I didn't write that title. That is what they did. In it, a spokesman 
for a major union in this country speaks on the legislation's language, 
calling for a transition for union jobs. He says, ``We've heard words 
like `just transition' before, but what does that really mean? Our 
Members are worried about putting food on the table.''
  Another labor union, the Laborers' International Union of North 
America states, ``We will never settle for `just transition' language 
as a solution to the job losses that will surely come from some of the 
policies in the resolution.''
  Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans across the country deserve to be 
heard. Unfortunately, as this article states, neither union was 
contacted for input before the legislation was released.
  And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield time to the gentleman from 
California's First District (Mr. LaMalfa), my good friend and a fellow 
farmer.

1410,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,17,Mr. LaMALFA,"  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, thank you to the gentleman from Washington 
(Mr. Newhouse).
  Indeed, what we know so far about the Green New Deal, it is more like 
a green pipe dream. It would lead to a total government takeover of 
just about every aspect of our lives.
  Now, it is interesting to watch, since the deal was proposed not that 
many days ago, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of 
them are starting to back away from it. There were 67 coauthors on 
that. We are seeing some starting to back away, saying, well, this 
really isn't the dream or the deal; it is more of an aspiration.
  Well, by the time you freaked out half the country with these ideas 
that you put into legislation, maybe we need a little more heads-up on 
what really is the goal here.
  Some of the guarantees in it:
  A government paycheck for those unwilling to work.
  Is that really in there? What are we talking about here?
  The cost of this implementation? $93 trillion, quadruple of what our 
national debt is right now. The cost will be passed on, of course, to--
as always--the taxpayer, to families, to those struggling--especially 
middle-income folks--who could see their energy bills going up from 
already at a high point to an additional $4,000 annually per family.
  We should really have our supporters of this bill benefit from the 
lessons learned in California on the high-speed rail boondoggle that 
tripled in a short amount of time soon after it was barely approved, 
$10 billion by the taxpayers to a nearly $100 billion project, all 
under the guise of saving greenhouse gases.
  Except during the construction of the high-speed rail in California, 
it will make a whole bunch of greenhouse gases with the equipment 
involved, so we are going to plant trees to offset that. Yet, at the 
same time, they are running the rails through hundreds of acres of 
almond trees in the middle of California that they are supposed to be 
offsetting.
  It is a reckless attempt to undermine America's increasing 
dominance--not just energy independence--but now dominance in energy 
around the world.
  It ignores the basic reality; a lot of what America was built upon 
were indeed fossil fuels, those known reserves that we have in this 
country.
  Now, let's talk a little bit about the Paris accord that I think 
President Trump rightfully withdrew the United States from. The goal 
being greenhouse gas reduction, CO2 reduction.
  Well, when you look at the stats, who is already leading the way 
outside of the accord? The U.S.--of those western countries--is the 
only one that has actually reduced its number of CO2 in that 
amount of time.
  We are the ones doing it. You know why? Because we have freedom; 
because we have the ability to innovate here, to invent the new 
technology, to invent the things that are going to help us do things 
better and cleaner into the future.
  I don't hear a lot of talk on this about new hydropower, which is 
clean and ready to go any time you turn on the switch to the gates to 
allow the turbines to flow.
  Biomass. In my area of the country--the Western Caucus, my colleagues 
here--we burn part of the west every year. We should be putting that 
fuel into clean burning power plants to make electricity, cleaning our 
forest, making it more fire-safe, better for the wildlife, better for 
the environment, not having all that CO2 go up. And then 
creating jobs in our backyard to get people to work from cleaning up 
the over-inventory the U.S. forest and BLM has from allowing their 
forest to run rampant with no management for the last 100 years.
  These are things we should be talking about, not this green dream 
thing. Instead, we are going to hear nothing but climate change, 
climate change, climate change, with solutions that just harness or 
handcuff the economy, the jobs, and the people of this country inside 
this chamber and in the real world out there where people actually 
produce things.
  We need to focus on the things that we know can work, producing 
energy with hydropower. Yes, with nuclear power, no emissions. With 
biomass, help clean that inventory that burns hundreds of thousands of 
acres every year of forest land, and put it to work for us.
  That is what we are going to be successful at, because the United 
States is always number one in developing the new technology, the new 
ways to do cleaner, better, more efficiently, instead of handcuffing 
our economy and that innovation and exporting it somewhere else.
  I do agree with my colleagues that have spoken here tonight. And in 
sending the message, we need to strongly oppose this bill and get back 
to something that actually works for the working people of this 
country.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time of the gentleman.",L000578,2019-02-25
1411,THE GREEN NEW DEAL,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-5,18,Mr. NEWHOUSE,"  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LaMalfa). I appreciate very much him sharing his thoughts--and 
California's thoughts--about what we have in front of us and the impact 
it would have.
  And if anyone is thinking that this is just a bunch of Republicans 
that are thinking this way and have these thoughts, let me share with 
you some quotes from some of my friends across the aisle, Mr. Speaker.
  Representative Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat from New Jersey. He says of 
the Green New Deal, ``It is not a serious policy proposal. It seeks the 
complete reorganization of American society, which took hundreds of 
years to build, in a matter of 10 years.''
  Or the senior Senator from California--Mr. LaMalfa's state--just 
stated last week that ``There's no way to pay for it.''
  From my own State, my colleague, Representative Rick Larsen just said 
recently, ``It is difficult to support the resolution right now when 
one of the lead sponsors says one of the intentions is to make air 
travel unnecessary.'' He is the chairman of the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation.
  My neighbor from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, chairman of the House Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure, said, ``The idea that in 5 or 10 
years we're not going to consume any more fossil fuels is 
technologically impossible. We can have grand goals, but let's be 
realistic about how we get there.''
  Even our own Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi from California, said 
of the proposal, ``The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody 
knows what it is, but they're for it, right?''
  So you can see, it is not just us, this is a bipartisan feeling about 
the Green New Deal that it needs a lot more consideration.
  Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. Norman), my good friend from the Palmetto State, Fifth 
District, and a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology.",N000189,2019-02-25

effort on this.
  And I rise to oppose the Green New Deal for many of the reasons that 
have already been said, but this is the most amateurish resolution that 
has come before this Congress in a long time, not from only my point of 
view but many others who have served longer than I have.
  We were asked to consider a policy that would change every aspect of 
American life, deciding what we eat, how we travel, how we stay warm, 
and even what jobs we can take and what homes we are allowed to live 
in.
  We are presented with a total overhaul of society, but with no 
explanation how. There is no roadmap, no method of implementation, and, 
of course, no price tag. All we know is that this will be dictated by a 
cabal of better-knowing bureaucrats. Yet every estimate shows just how 
unrealistic this green deal really is.
  According to the American Action Forum, the total cost could run as 
high as $93 trillion over 10 years.


  This totals 21 times our current Federal budget of $4.4 trillion. 
That can only mean one thing for the American people: taxes, taxes, and 
more taxes.
  This resolution is so lacking in detail, we might as well vote on the 
merits of a scrap of paper that says, ``solve the problem.'' This is no 
way to govern.


  The only details we do have are from a survey that enjoyed a brief 
existence online before it was removed out of embarrassment and has 
since been denied.
  One source of embarrassment was the call to get rid of cows. To my 
knowledge, this is the first time that a Member of this House has 
called for bovine genocide.
  That the deal's supporters are now hiding these facts reveals that 
the true agenda behind the Green New Deal is too horrifying to be 
shared with any of the public. As a rule of thumb, any law that cannot 
be shared with the people cannot serve the people.",N000190,2019-02-25

for his input on this important issue. It underscores the cost to the 
Nation if this were adopted and its impact on our economy. I thank the 
gentleman for that tremendous help.
  I thank all my colleagues, members of the Congressional Western 
Caucus, for participating tonight to point out some of the fallacies of 
the Green New Deal. Certainly, it is something that, as legislation is 
proposed, this is the process: We talk about what we like, what we 
don't like, and we offer alternatives, trying to find solutions in a 
bipartisan way.
  Republicans have always advocated to continue looking at these issues 
of climate change, of energy use and production, of issues facing the 
environment. We are always looking for ways to innovate, to adequately 
fund research, but, basically, underscoring all of that, relying on the 
use of sound science for any decisions that we make, to make sure that 
the policies that we adopt are those that will be sustaining and good 
for not only our country, but for the world.
  So we base our decisions on science, not politics. As Republicans, as 
members of the Congressional Western Caucus, which is a bipartisan 
organization, we look forward to debating seriously and making serious 
decisions in regard to these very important issues that face our 
country, face the next generation, and face the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing debates on this important 
topic, and I yield back the balance of my time.

1414,NATIONAL DEBT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2049-6,0,Mr. COMER,"  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in disappointment that, once 
again, the Federal Government is nearing another debt limit. Our 
national debt is a record $22 trillion.
  I blame both parties for this reckless and immoral burden that has 
been placed on our children. We do not have a taxing problem in 
Congress; we have a spending problem in Congress.
  Both parties have lacked fiscal responsibility over the past four 
decades. Both parties have operated in deficits when they were in 
power.
  Mr. Speaker, it will take both parties working together to control 
our spending. Our national debt is the single biggest challenge that 
faces our great country, and, surely, we can make it a bipartisan 
movement to cut unnecessary and wasteful spending while still funding 
our most important priorities of Social Security, Medicare, and our 
national defense.

1415,ASSISTANT SHERIFF LANA TOMLIN RECEIVES THE ALUMNI HALL OF FAME AWARD,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE205-3,0,Mr. COOK,"  Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and 
commitment of Assistant Sheriff Lana Tomlin, who received the Alumni 
Hall of Fame Award from the Victor Valley College foundation on 
February 23, 2019.
  Assistant Sheriff Tomlin is a dedicated public servant who has worked 
for the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department for over twenty-nine 
years. Soon after her graduation from the San Bernardino County 
Sheriffs Department Training Academy, Assistant Sheriff Tomlin was 
assigned to the Barstow Station as a patrol deputy where she quickly 
excelled in her duties while simultaneously attending Victor Valley 
College. She is the first woman in the history of San Bernardino County 
to be appointed to Assistant Sheriff and oversees several departments 
and operations. Locally, Assistant Sheriff Tomlin has served multiple 
assignments at different High Desert stations, including serving as 
Captain of the Apple Valley Sheriffs Station. She has also volunteered 
throughout the community, from coaching the women's basketball team at 
Victor Valley College to giving back to our next generation through the 
Police Activities League program.
  On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I would like to 
congratulate Assistant Sheriff Lana Tomlin on this award. Lana is an 
exemplary law enforcement officer and community leader. I thank her for 
her years of dedication and service to the people of San Bernardino 
County.

1416,MARFAN AWARENESS MONTH,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE201-4,0,Mr. SUOZZI,"  Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Americans 
affected by Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders in 
observance of February as Marfan Awareness Month.
  Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condition. About 1 in 5,000 
Americans carries a mutation in gene called fibrillin which results in 
an overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor beta 
or TGFB. The increased TGFB impacts connective tissue and since 
connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome 
features can manifest throughout the body. Patients often have 
disproportionately long limbs, a protruding or indented chest bone, 
curved spine, and loose joints. However, it is not the outward signs 
that concern Marfan syndrome patients, but the effects the condition 
has on internal systems. Most notably, in Marfan patients the large 
artery, known as the aorta, which carries blood away from the hemi is 
weakened and prone to enlargement and rupture, which can be fatal. It 
is for this reason that increased awareness of Marfan syndrome can save 
lives.
  I am proud to represent The Marfan Foundation, which is headquartered 
in Port Washington. The Marfan Foundation is the nation's foremost 
organization working to raise awareness of Marfan syndrome and 
supporting the marfan community. The Marfan Foundation has worked 
tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals affected by Marfan 
syndrome and related connective tissue conditions by advancing 
research, raising awareness, and providing support.
  While there is currently no cure for Marfan syndrome, efforts are 
underway to enhance our understanding of the condition and improve 
patient care. I applaud the National Institutes of Health, particularly 
the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National 
Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases for their 
research efforts in this regard. I encourage NIH to expand research 
efforts in this area.
  Early diagnosis and proper treatment are the keys to managing Marfan 
syndrome and living a full life. I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in supporting a Marfan education and awareness program at the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. We can facilitate proper treatment 
by raising awareness leading to early diagnosis. I urge my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing February as Marfan Awareness Month.

1417,NORTH KOREA,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1413,0,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the President is on his way to Thailand 
for a second summit with Chairman Kim of North Korea. It is in all of 
our interests for the President to achieve a diplomatic resolution with 
North Korea that achieves a stable peace and the complete, verifiable, 
and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Failing 
that, the Congress must continue to pressure a regime that permits 
gross humanitarian abuses and remains one of the most repressive 
governments on the globe.
  We cannot tolerate the President making concessions without, in 
exchange, receiving verifiable, enduring, and concrete commitments from 
North Korea to denuclearize.
  President Trump's first summit with Chairman Kim granted his regime 
the international legitimacy and acceptance that Kim has long craved 
while undermining our policy of maximum pressure and sanctions, 
seemingly so the President could have a photo op and make a speech.
  Unsurprisingly, the results of that meeting were disappointing. The 
President claimed, bizarrely and wildly, that North Korea is ``no 
longer a nuclear threat'' right after the meeting, while the U.S. 
intelligence community has continually testified before Congress that 
North Korea has not been denuclearizing and appears unlikely to give up 
its nuclear weapons. So how can the President say it is no longer a 
nuclear threat when the same threat existed when he threatened North 
Korea earlier and after, when he seemed to make nice to President Kim? 
Meanwhile, the President suspended joint military readiness drills with 
the South Koreans--drills we have been conducting for 60 years for the 
safety of East Asia.
  No one wants to see a repeat of the same movie. No one wants another 
summit that is more about photo ops and optics than progress. We are 
all rooting for diplomacy to succeed, but the President can't be too 
naive or too eager to reach a deal that gives him the photo op again 
but that doesn't achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula.

1419,NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089,0,Mr. McADAMS,"  Mr. McADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 47, the Natural 
Resources Management Act, which we will vote on tomorrow. This 
comprehensive public lands package has numerous provisions that benefit 
my State of Utah and makes permanent the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund.
  In my district, this legislation provides an important land 
conveyance to Juab County that will be used to house personnel to 
prevent and fight wildfires. This bill also facilitates a land transfer 
in Utah County to Utah's School and Institutional Trust Lands 
Administration, or SITLA.
  SITLA holds lands in trust, proceeds which support Utah's education 
system. This land transfer will ultimately benefit Utah State 
University and its students.
  I also want to congratulate my colleague, Representative   John 
Curtis, for his work in bringing together and working with State, city, 
and county stakeholders in Emery County. The Emery County title in this 
bill has broad local support and will protect over 600,000 acres of 
wilderness, the largest wilderness designation in 25 years.
  This legislation is good for Utah's economy. The Land and Water 
Conservation Fund should never have been allowed to expire because it 
is such a vital program.

today to pay tribute to Justice Elizabeth Audrey Taylor for her many 
years of compassionate service and tireless work to improve the lives 
of our Bronx residents. Justice Taylor is a great example of the 
countless contributions that African Americans make every day to the 
Bronx and our Nation.
  Justice Taylor was born and raised in the Highbridge Section of the 
Bronx and is a product of the public school system. She received a 
Bachelor of Arts in English from Binghamton University and her Juris 
Doctor from Ohio Northern University School of Law. She began her 
career as a legislative aide in the New York City Council and then went 
to work in private practice, where she specialized in landlord and 
tenant issues. Thereafter, Justice Taylor returned to the public sector 
as the Senior Court Attorney to Justice Edgar G. Walker, who at the 
time was serving in the Bronx Criminal Court. Until 2008, she continued 
her commitment to public service by serving as Principal Law Clerk to 
New York Supreme Court Justice Kenneth L. Thompson, Jr. , who is 
currently serving in the Civil Term of Bronx County Supreme Court.
  In addition, Justice Taylor was recently elected Justice of the 
Supreme Court of the State of New York. She was first elected in 2008 
to the Civil Court of the City of New York and has been honored as 
Judge of the Year by the Bronx County Bar Association and the Bronx 
Advocates for Justice.
  Justice Taylor is also a member of the Military Academy Review 
Committee for the 15th Congressional district. She has been a member of 
this committee since 2014 and has been instrumental in helping our 
office make military academy recommendations since then. This has 
allowed numerous students from the 15th Congressional District to 
attend these prestigious schools with full scholarships.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues join me in honoring Justice 
Elizabeth Audrey Taylor for her consistently remarkable dedication to 
the law and commitment to serving her community.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 583, the Preventing Illegal Radio 
Abuse Through Enforcement Act, or PIRATE Act, a bill sponsored by 
myself and Mr. Bilirakis. This measure is a bipartisan, commonsense 
bill that passed the House last Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, first, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has worked 
on this measure. I thank Representative Bilirakis for agreeing to lead 
this effort with me in this Congress. I thank our former colleague, 
Congressman Leonard Lance, for all his work on this bill in the past. 
And I thank the New York State broadcasters for their dedication.
  For years, I, along with many Members of the New York and New Jersey 
delegations, have voiced our concern that pirate radio operators are a 
threat to Americans' public health and safety. Yet these lawbreakers 
are as prevalent as ever, and their actions have been met with few 
consequences. This legislation responds directly to that threat.
  The FCC has taken some positive steps to remedy this issue, but more 
needs to be done.
  In short, the PIRATE Act would increase penalties and restrictions on 
pirate radio.
  Whether a radio frequency is being used by first responders 
coordinating to save lives, or parents who want to keep obscenity and 
bigotry away from their children, for example, our communities are 
better served when broadcasters respect the rule of law.
  Previous drafts of the PIRATE Act included provisions creating 
liability for those who facilitate illegal pirate radio operation. 
These provisions were removed as being duplicative with existing law. 
For example, under current law, the FCC can hold a property owner 
liable for allowing a pirate radio operator access or other assistance.
  Cutting these provisions should not be taken as limiting the 
Commission's authority to assess fines against those who assist illegal 
pirate operations. On the contrary, the consequences established in 
this act would also apply in these contexts.


  The text of the bill before us today includes changes that were 
requested in the Senate last Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 583 
from the 50 State broadcast associations.
                                                 January 18, 2019.
     50 State Broadcasters Associations Urge Passage of the 
         Bipartisan PIRATE Act
     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Mitch McConnell,
     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.

     Hon. Charles Schumer,
     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leaders McCarthy, McConnell and 
     Schumer: The undersigned broadcasters associations 
     representing local, over-the-air broadcast stations in all 50 
     States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of 
     Puerto Rico urge your swift consideration and passage of the 
     Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement (PIRATE) 
     Act (H.R. 583). The PIRATE Act would provide the Federal 
     Communications Commission (FCC) with critical new enforcement 
     measures to combat pirate radio operations. Last Congress, 
     substantially similar bipartisan legislation (H.R. 5709, 
     115th) passed the House of Representatives unanimously.
       For years unauthorized pirate radio stations have harmed 
     communities across the country by undermining the Emergency 
     Alert System, interfering with airport communications, posing 
     direct health risks and interfering with licensed stations' 
     abilities to serve their listeners. The time has come to take 
     significant steps to resolve this vexing problem.
       The PIRATE Act gives the FCC additional tools to address 
     the growing pirate radio problem. It provides the authority 
     to levy increased fines up to $100,000 per violation and 
     $2,000,000 in total. The PIRATE Act streamlines the 
     enforcement process and requires the FCC to conduct pirate 
     radio enforcement sweeps in cities with a concentration of 
     pirate radio stations. It recognizes the importance of FCC 
     coordination with federal, state and local law enforcement 
     authorities. Finally, the PIRATE Act would create a database 
     of all licensed radio stations operating in the AM and FM 
     bands as well as those entities that have been subject to 
     enforcement actions for illegal operation.
       We are reaching the point where illegal pirate stations 
     undermine the legitimacy and purpose of the FCC's licensing 
     system to the detriment of listeners in communities across 
     the country. The PIRATE Act will help the FCC restore 
     integrity to the system. For these reasons, local 
     broadcasters across our great nation fully support the 
     bipartisan PIRATE Act and urge its swift passage without 
     changes.

transmitters, the FCC and other entities cannot protect the over 240

  The bipartisan bill takes an important step to protect the vital

  When illegal pirate radio operators interfere with important public

illegal pirate operators also interfere with critical aviation 
frequencies, potentially putting lives at risk.

Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement (PIRATE) Act, 
introduced by Reps. Paul Tonko and Gus Bilirakis. I want to thank Rep. 
Chris Collins of New York and former Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey 
for leading on this last Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I've been around radio for most of my life. From working 
as a teenage janitor at my dad's radio station to spending more than 20 
years as a radio station owner myself; in fact, I'm still a licensed 
amateur radio operator today. But you don't need that much experience 
to understand that protecting our public airwaves from illegal pirate 
radio interference is important for consumers and broadcasters alike.


  The PIRATE Act gives the FCC additional tools to address the growing 
pirate radio problem and increases the penalties for bad actors. These 
illegal broadcasts deprive Americans of important programming provided 
by legitimate broadcast license-holders serving the public interest. 
And they can disrupt important public safety communications, including 
our nation's Emergency Alert System and critical aviation frequencies. 
In many cases, these pirate radio stations broadcast vile and vulgar 
content, which also harms consumers. By preventing illegal pirate radio 
operations, consumers are protected, and airwaves are kept free for 
legitimate broadcasts and public safety announcements.
  Last Congress, this House passed the PIRATE Act by voice vote. I'd 
like to thank our former colleague Leonard Lance, who first authored

commissioner, Commissioner Marcus Hardy, who was a highly respected 
leader in his community.
  Marcus served as a city commissioner in the town of Crescent City, 
Florida, which is located in the district which I am proud to 
represent. I was fortunate enough to work alongside Mr. Hardy in 
efforts to improve Crescent City and the greater community.
  Beyond being a devoted public servant, a coach, and a role model, 
Marcus was a family man and a friend to many. Anyone who knew him knew 
his heart and his passion for serving others. He often spent his free 
time serving as a mentor for the Boys II Men organization in Crescent 
City or working to revitalize Putnam County for the benefit of the 
whole community.
  Marcus will be remembered for his compassion, his leadership, his 
friendship, his large, firm hand grip and contagious smile.
  Thank you for your service, Marcus. You will be missed by many.

1439,FLOODING IN KENTUCKY,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1409-2,0,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, today I would like to turn 
attention to the severe weather that is afflicting communities 
throughout my home State.
  Nearly 20 counties from one end of the State to the other have 
declared states of emergency in response to historically high water 
levels. Just moments ago, Governor Matt Bevin put


the entire Commonwealth under a state of emergency to mobilize 
resources where they are needed most. Many families are evacuating 
toward safety. Approximately 2,400 people in eastern and southern 
Kentucky are still without power. Mudslides have closed roads. Bridges 
are flooded, and emergency personnel have been deployed to rescue 
stranded drivers and others in danger.
  I want to express my gratitude to the first responders working around 
the clock to keep their communities safe. It may be a difficult road to 
recovery, but Kentuckians are already pitching in to help their 
neighbors in need.
  My staff and I are ready to work with emergency management officials 
and will continue to monitor the situation closely.

1446,TRIBUTE TO TOM FONTANA,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1434,0,Mr. INHOFE,"  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations 
to Tom Fontana, special assistant to the CEO for the U.S. Capitol 
Visitor Center, CVC, on his retirement after 30 years of Federal 
service.
  Tom began his career at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1988. He 
was responsible for communications for one of the Corps' largest 
projects, the renovation of the Pentagon in the 1990s. He eventually 
joined the U.S. Department of Defense, where he continued working to 
successfully completing the project. Tom was at the Pentagon on 
September 11, 2001, when a plane hijacked by terrorist crashed into the 
building.
  While Tom had just accepted a position with the Architect of the 
Capitol, AOC, to manage communications for the construction phase of 
the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, due to the tragedy, he remained in his 
position at the Pentagon to lend assistance before assuming his role 
with the CVC in 2001.


Throughout the construction of the CVC, Tom provided countless tours 
and briefings to Members of Congress, including leadership and their 
staff. Given his depth of knowledge, responsiveness, and evenhandedness 
through that challenging time, Tom earned great respect from the 
Members of Congress and the media in Washington.
  In 2008, Tom subsequently assumed the role of director of 
communications and marketing for the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. Under 
Tom's leadership, the CVC communications division expanded from 
providing the basics of a startup operation, to providing a wide range 
of communications to help visitors learn about the Capitol and workings 
of Congress. He has always looked for ways to take advantage of new 
technologies to engage visitors, students in particular, about 
Congress's history. Under his leadership, the first AOC apps were 
developed, and one of them received a national award for its 
innovation.
  For many Members of Congress, dignitaries, AOC, and CVC staff, Tom is 
the authoritative voice on the Capitol Visitor Center. He is widely 
respected for his unique knowledge about the Capitol building and 
grounds. From presenting inspiring tours to engaging visitors who are 
simply seeking directions, he personifies an experience all visitors 
expect when they come to the U.S. Capitol. Tom is an ambassador for the 
CVC, the Capitol, and Congress without equal.
  Tom has also been an incredible asset to me and my office throughout 
his leadership at the CVC. Every year, I host a unique dinner on 
Capitol Hill for governmental leaders from all over the continent of 
Africa, including heads of state, legislators, and cabinet members. 
Ambassadors and guests who are key leaders in Africa also attend, along 
with several U.S. legislators. Prior to the dinner, we provide the 
guests with a tour of the Capitol to learn more about our Capitol 
building and the workings of Congress. Throughout all of the years I 
have held the tour and dinner, Tom has gone above and beyond what was 
required to make our guests feel welcome and to ensure that everything 
runs smoothly. His role in the success of our event has become so 
essential that, several years ago, we began inviting Tom to the dinner 
not only to support it, but to take part in it.
  Tom leaves big shoes to fill. My Senate colleagues and I appreciate 
Tom's hard work and commitment to our Capitol and country. He will be 
missed, but I wish him all the best in his retirement.

McFadden on a remarkable 40-year career at WNDU-TV. I want to take a 
moment to honor the iconic legacy Maureen is leaving behind and thank 
her for all she has done for Michiana communities.
  A lifelong Hoosier, Maureen has been a fixture in South Bend as a 
reporter and anchor at WNDU Newscenter 16 for the past four decades. 
She has played a


vital role in making northern Indiana stronger not only by bringing us 
the day's news, but always finding ways to serve her neighbors and give 
back to the community she loves to call home.
  I am grateful to Maureen not only for her excellence in journalism, 
but also for the incredible example she has set for aspiring 
journalists and young Hoosier women who are always looking for ways to 
give back to build a brighter future.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
exceptional character, leadership, and compassion Maureen has 
demonstrated both on and off the air.

1448,HONORING SHERIFF MIKE YEAGER,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2087-3,0,Mr. FERGUSON,"  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Coweta County 
Sheriff Mike Yeager.
  Sheriff Yeager has dedicated over 35 years in law enforcement to 
keeping his community safe and serving his neighbors, both on and off 
of the job.
  In fact, it would take far longer than I have here tonight to list 
all of the many organizations--such as the Georgia and National 
Sheriff's Association, the Newnan-Coweta Public Safety Board, and the 
Boy Scouts--so many organizations that he has served to make his 
community and State a better place.
  It is no understatement that Sheriff Yeager is a pillar of his 
community and a model public servant. It is a testament to his hard 
work that President Trump appointed him to be the U.S. marshal for the 
Northern District of Georgia. I cannot think of anyone who is better 
suited for this position.
  We are awfully proud of Sheriff Yeager and his accomplishments, and I 
know that he will continue to serve his State and our Nation well.

1449,IN HONOR OF ANDREW AND ILA MARTINEZ,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE203-2,0,Mr. BRADY,"  Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of Andrew 
and Ila Martinez of Huntsville, Texas.
  Andrew and Ila, beloved parents and lifelong Texans, spent their 
lives in service to others, and today, we remember all that they stood 
for. Andrew ``Andy'' Martinez was born in Galveston, Texas and later 
became a proud member of the Huntsville community. His multifaceted 
career path included time spent as a proud small business owner of 
Martinez Tire and Supply, a construction safety supervisor for the 
Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), and as an ordained 
minister. A faithful and steadfast Christian, Andy served as the 
interim pastor of Faith Memorial Baptist Church, and was an active 
member of several other churches in the Huntsville area.
  Andy's faithfulness, generosity, and love for those around him was 
not only evident on Sundays--it was visible every day of his life. Andy 
served the Huntsville community in a variety of public roles. He was an 
elected member of the Huntsville City Council, the Director for Trinity 
River Authority's Walker County Area, a member of the Board of Trustees 
for Huntsville lSD, and Chairman of the Republican Party of Walker 
County. Andy also acted as a Prison Ministry Volunteer in Huntsville--a 
position he held for over 30 remarkable years. Those who knew Andy will 
attest to his sincere selflessness. He always worked towards leaving 
the Huntsville community better than he found it.
  Ila Martinez was Andy's wonderful wife of over 63 years and was not 
only a devoted partner to him, but was a loving mother and active in 
the community as well. A leading member of the Republican Party of 
Walker County, Ila was involved in the Red Hat Ladies and the Calendar 
Girls, a group of friends from Conroe High School that would meet once 
a month at lunchtime. Ila had a great love for volunteering and was 
often working with the Walker County Republican women or at her church 
library. Ila was a doting grandmother and her greatest pleasure was 
teaching her beloved granddaughters how to sew and bake.
  Andy and Ila had two daughters, Andrea Scott and the late Debbie 
Martinez, and a son, Russell Martinez. Andy and Ila are survived by 
Andrea and her husband Wayne; their son, Russell; two beautiful 
grandchildren, Angela Stacks and husband Jared; Mika Spears and her 
husband Neal; and three great-grandchildren: Draper Stacks, Megan 
Anthony, and Trent Spears.
  The legacy of Andy and Ila will always be a part of the Huntsville 
community, kept alive in the hearts of those who knew and loved them. 
Both were selfless servants dedicated to bettering the lives of those 
around them, and they will be greatly missed.

1450,DANIEL ``DANNY'' M. BARBER,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE202,0,Mr. SERRANO,"  Mr. SERRANO. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor Mr. Daniel 
``Danny'' M. Barber for his many years of tireless advocacy to improve 
the lives of Bronx residents. He is a great example of everyday 
contributions that African-Americans have made in my district in the 
Bronx and the Nation.
  Mr. Barber was born in 1969 to the late Dan Walker and Janie Barber-
Walker and is the youngest of five children. He attended the De Witt 
Clinton High School and was a member of the football team. He began his 
love for community work when he joined the ranks of the Salvation Army 
during his early years and went on to excel as Director and afterward 
became Assistant to the Commanding Officer.
  Mr. Barber currently serves as the President of the Andrew Jackson 
Houses Resident Association, Inc., and is the Founder of SOY, Inc. 
(Save Our Youth). Recently, he was elected to serve as the Chair of the 
City-Wide Council of Presidents, which oversees all of the NYCHA 
Resident's Associations, and also serves as the Chair of The South 
Bronx Council of Presidents. While serving in these capacities, he also 
serves on several other agencies and organizations boards giving 
technical support and principled guidance.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Daniel 
M. Barber for his steadfast dedication and years of public service to 
our NYCHA residents, and for his longstanding commitment to improving

1452,S. 311,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1414,0,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, a word on today's vote on women's 
reproductive rights: The bill the Senate will vote on shortly is 
carefully crafted to target, intimidate, and shut down reproductive 
healthcare providers. Doctors across this country--Democratic doctors, 
Republican doctors--are lining up against the bill because it would 
impose requirements on what type of care doctors must provide in 
certain circumstances, even if that care is ineffective, contradictory 
to medical evidence, and against the family's wishes.
  My Republican colleagues have said some incendiary things about 
opposing this bill. Let me be very clear. Many of these claims are 
false. It has always been illegal to harm a newborn infant. This vote 
has nothing--nothing--to do with that. Read the language. We are 
talking about situations when expectant parents tragically learn their 
pregnancy is no longer viable, and there is a fatal diagnosis. What 
happens in those circumstances should be decided between a woman, her 
family, her minister, priest, rabbi, imam, and her doctor.
  It makes no sense for Washington politicians who know nothing about 
individual circumstances to say they know better than the doctors or 
the patients and their families. The bill is solely meant to intimidate 
doctors and restrict patients' access to care and has nothing--nothing, 
nothing--to do with protecting children.
  Last Friday, the administration announced it was imposing a gag rule 
on U.S. reproductive healthcare providers and trying to restrict access 
to healthcare clinics that provide reproductive care. So this vote 
doesn't occur in a vacuum. It is part of a pattern of actions taken by 
President Trump and congressional Republicans to limit, deny, or 
circumscribe a woman's right to healthcare.
  I urge the American people to do their own research, read the bill, 
and see what it says. Most of you will agree with it. Pay attention to 
the facts and not the false rhetoric. This bill is Washington politics 
at its worst. I will vote no.

Richard Pearl on his retirement as the OSF Children's Hospital Surgeon-
in-Chief.
  Dr. Pearl has committed his life to the practice and growth of 
medicine. He studied at Wright State University College of Medicine, 
where he was first in his class. After his schooling, Dr. Pearl 
completed his surgical residency at the Harvard Surgical Service at the 
New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
  In his career, Dr. Pearl has made it his priority to do all that he 
can for others. He served honorably in the U.S. Army, reaching the rank 
of Colonel, with a distinguished career spanning nearly thirty. He 
served his country first as an Infantry Officer and then as a 
helicopter pilot. He was given command of a helicopter company in the 
First Cavalry Division in Vietnam. Dr. Pearl has received numerous 
Military Honors and awards including three Bronze Stars, the Legion of 
Merit and The Air Medal for Valor. Dr. Pearl has also devoted a great 
portion of his time to sharing his knowledge and research. He has 
published over 85 articles in peer-reviewed journals and 22 book 
chapters.
  During his tenure, the medical community has had no better champion 
than Dr. Pearl. He has always been a fierce advocate for the 
advancement of Pediatrics. Central lllinois will forever be grateful 
for Dr. Pearl's years of service.

1456,TRIBUTE TO THE 2018 ELLIS ISLAND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE205-4,0,Mr. LaHOOD,"  Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2018 
recipients of the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor.
  Presented annually, the Ellis Island Medals of Honor pay tribute to 
our Nation's immigrant heritage, as well as individual achievement. The 
Medals are awarded to U.S. citizens from diverse ethnic backgrounds who 
exemplify outstanding qualities in both their personal and professional 
lives, while continuing to preserve the richness of their particular 
heritage and culture. We honor these outstanding individuals because 
the important work they do today, creates a better world for all of us 
tomorrow. This momentous occasion was celebrated with a patriotic 
ceremony on Ellis Island and a recommitment by the leaders of the 
organization to their mission of honoring diversity, fostering 
tolerance and promoting religious and racial unity across America.
  Since the Medals' founding, more than 2,500 American citizens have 
received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including seven American 
Presidents, numerous United States Senators and Congressmen, two Nobel 
Laureates, and many athletes, artists, clergy, and military leaders. 
This Medal is not about material success, nor is it about the politics 
of immigration; it is about the people who have committed themselves to 
this nation, embraced the opportunities America offers, and most 
importantly, who have used those opportunities to not only better their 
own lives but make a difference in our country and in the lives of its 
people.
  Citizens of the United States hail from every nation known to man. 
The iconic metaphor of this nation as a veritable melting pot of 
cultures continues to ring true, and it is this diversity that adds to 
the unique richness of American life. It is the key to why America is 
the most innovative, progressive and forward thinking country in the 
world. The Ellis Island Medals of Honor not only celebrate select 
individuals but also the pluralism and democracy that enabled our 
forbearers to celebrate their cultural identities while still embracing 
the American way of life. This award serves to remind us all that with 
hard work and perseverance anyone can still achieve the American dream. 
In addition, by honoring these remarkable Americans, we honor all who 
share their origins and we acknowledge the contributions they have made 
to America. I commend National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations and 
its Board of Directors headed by Nasser J. Kazeminy, for honoring these 
truly outstanding individuals for their tireless efforts to foster 
dialogue and build bridges between different ethnic groups, as well as 
to promote unity and a sense of common purpose in our nation.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the good 
works of NECO and in congratulating all of the 2018 recipients of the 
Ellis Island Medal of Honor. I include in the Record the names of this 
year's recipients.

installed Clerk of the U.S. House, Cheryl Lynn Johnson.
  She is the 36th American to be elected to this critical position. The 
Clerk, as we know, serves as the legislative official in the House, a 
position that goes back to the first Clerk and to the first Congress in 
1789. As was mentioned, she comes to us from the Smithsonian 
Institution where she served as the Director of Government Relations.
  Among her many achievements, as was mentioned, Cheryl helped to make 
the National Museum of African American History and Culture a brilliant 
reality.
  But this is not her first tour of duty on Capitol Hill. In fact, she 
previously spent almost two decades in service to this institution, and 
as was mentioned, her first position was serving on the


committee staff of my father, former Congressman Bill Clay.
  She spent 10 years as the chief education and investigative counsel 
for the Committee on Education and the Workforce where she advanced 
reforms in elementary and secondary education, juvenile justice, child 
nutrition, labor issues, and employment and nutrition programs for 
seniors.
  Prior to that, she served as staff director and counsel for the 
Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Libraries and 
Memorials and then Subcommittee on the Post Office and Civil Service.
  Ms. Johnson is a distinguished graduate of Howard University Law 
School and the University of Iowa. She is married to Clarence and has a 
son, Bradford.
  I go back with Cheryl as a friend for 40 years. Our families are 
close. Growing up around this institution that we all love, I was 
fortunate to be in the company of and witness the examples set by many 
great public servants--Members and staff--who devoted themselves to 
representing their constituents in the true spirit of public service.
  Cheryl Johnson exemplifies the highest standards of public service, 
honor, and integrity that will elevate the 116th Congress. I am pleased 
to welcome her as our new Clerk, and I am prouder still to call her my 
good friend. She will be an enormous resource for Members and staff, 
and I am proud to welcome her home.
  Welcome back, Cheryl. Congratulations.

for more than 23 years in Washington, D.C.
  With a history degree from Pennsylvania State University, Mr. Morin 
chose to launch his career in the service of our nation. He trained 
intensively as an Arabic linguist and intelligence analyst in the U.S. 
Army and was posted to the Presidio in Monterey. This gave Bill his 
first taste of California and forged lifelong links to the region that 
would become Silicon Valley. Following four years of service in the 
military, he joined the National Association of Manufacturers where he 
worked to create American jobs by advancing intellectual property, 
trade and technology policy.
  In 1996, Bill joined the small team of R. Wayne Sayer and Associates, 
one of the first Washington firms specializing in issues to support the 
rapidly expanding U.S. high technology industry and began to represent 
Applied Materials. In 2002, he opened and led Applied's first direct 
office in Washington, D.C. Over the years, he advocated for public 
policy that would allow high-tech manufacturers like Applied to 
maintain a strong footprint in the United States while accessing fast-
growing overseas markets and reinvesting in the innovation and R&D that 
would ensure American leadership in technology. The policies he 
advocated for on behalf of Applied Materials helped it develop into a 
major U.S. manufacturer and exporter, a world leader in materials 
engineering solutions and a model Silicon Valley corporate citizen.
  Madam Speaker, upon Bill's departure from our nation's capital, he 
has wisely chosen to spend his retirement in California, returning to 
the shores of Monterey Bay where he began his career. I congratulate 
Bill on his retirement, for his service to our country and for his 
service to Applied Materials where his contributions helped open the 
world's markets to the innovations of Silicon Valley.

  Mr. Speaker, despite being under the weather, I decided to come down 
here to thank my colleague and the dean of our delegation, 
Congresswoman Dina Titus, for leading this bipartisan effort.
  This legislation would establish the Classified School Employee of 
the Year RISE Award Program to recognize the achievements and 
contributions of classified school employees to student education in 
schools across the country.
  Classified school employees are critical members of the education 
workforce, making up one out of every three public school employees who 
assist students in our Nation's public schools. Classified school 
employees provide essential services, such as transportation, 
facilities maintenance and operations, food service, safety, and 
healthcare.
  It is past time that the U.S. Department of Education recognize the 
tireless efforts of our Nation's outstanding classified school 
employees. The stature of the Secretary of Education in recognizing the 
RISE Award will provide national leadership and partnership to 
encourage broad participation in the development, selection, and 
recognition process.
  Classified school employees across the country do extraordinary and 
inspirational things in their schools and communities to promote 
quality education, foster positive learning environments, and ensure 
student success. The RISE Award will recognize the contributions of 
classified school employees to student success.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the 
balance of my time.",L000590,2019-02-25

as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 276. I thank my 
colleagues across the aisle, the gentlewoman from Nevada, and also all 
those who are original cosponsors in support of this bill.
  It is not uncommon for a school employee to make a lasting impression 
on a student or even on entire generations of students. Front office 
attendants, school custodians, school safety personnel, food service 
workers, and others all interface directly with countless students 
every day. Many of these school employees make lifelong impacts on the 
students who they serve.
  Ask any student and they will probably tell you about a particular 
school employee who may not have been their teacher, but, nevertheless, 
imparted crucial life lessons upon them or inspired joy and confidence 
in students who struggled to find either. Schools are made better by 
these leaders, and students benefit from their kindness, 
thoughtfulness, compassion, and respect that they show to others around 
them.
  Mr. Speaker, these employees truly go above and beyond the call of 
duty to serve American students, and their steadfast devotion deserves 
our appreciation and recognition.
  H.R. 276, the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees 
Act, will direct the Secretary of Education to establish the 
Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award, otherwise known as the 
RISE Award. The RISE Award will be presented each year to a classified 
school employee in a nonteaching position in recognition of their 
invaluable contribution to the lives of students at the schools that 
they serve.
  The award will be nonmonetary and will go to employees who 
demonstrate excellent work performance, school and community 
involvement, leadership, and commitment, and who exemplify the very 
best of what it means to be a classified school employee.
  H.R. 276 is just one small way to honor the men and women in our 
communities who demonstrate to students what it means to be outstanding 
citizens and civic leaders. Their tireless efforts deserve our 
recognition and thanks. I urge my colleagues in the House to support 
this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.",T000467,2019-02-25

1468,RECOGNIZING ACHIEVEMENT IN CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ACT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2060,7,Ms. TITUS,"  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for her 
support of this bill that creates the RISE Award.
  I would like to address the bill before you by telling you the story 
of Ms. Virginia Mills. Ms. Mills started her career as a security guard 
at William E. Orr Middle School in District One in Las Vegas over two 
decades ago.

  Almost immediately upon getting to the school, she saw that children 
were going to school without backpacks on their shoulders to carry 
their books and equipment. She saw athletes trying out for the 
basketball team without having the proper shoes on their feet. She saw 
children who didn't have enough clothes to make it through the whole 
week without changing.
  So in her very first month on the job, taking old items from her own 
daughter's closet, she started a clothes closet for middle school 
students in need. She first enlisted the help of friends, then 
teachers, and then community members. Eventually, the closet grew to 
include school supplies and even food for children to take home on the 
weekends, when they might otherwise go hungry.
  Ms. Mills has watched these students grow over the years to become 
assemblymen and -women in the legislature, business leaders, and 
community organizers. She said: ``Giving a helping hand to these 
students has inspired them to become better adults . . . . They now 
understand the importance of paying it forward.''
  Virginia Mills has improved the lives of so many middle school 
students in my district, and she has filled a gap that too many young 
people are in danger of falling into. And she wanted me to tell you 
that she didn't do it alone.
  There are countless people in our schools, including security guards 
who do more than keep students safe; they keep them motivated. There 
are bus drivers who provide more than just a ride; they offer 
friendship. There are counselors and nurses and cafeteria workers who 
strive tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the success of our 
students in our schools. Yet, too often, their contributions go 
unrecognized.
  That is why I introduced this bipartisan legislation to celebrate the 
critical role that school staff plays in helping our students learn and 
enabling our teachers to teach.


  The contributions of these vital school employees can't really be 
measured, but they can and should be recognized.
  It is in our children's interest and certainly in our national 
interest for the Department of Education to


present these RISE Awards to people like Virginia Mills who have made 
such a profound impact on our Nation's youth. So for those who work so 
hard to help our students become the best versions of themselves, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''",T000468,2019-02-25
1469,RECOGNIZING ACHIEVEMENT IN CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ACT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2060,8,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania,"  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the story that was shared about the woman 
working in that school district. I think we all probably have those 
stories as we think fondly back on our school experiences, whether it 
was elementary or high school, about individuals who weren't 
necessarily teachers but were still very influential in making an 
impression and setting a great example to be followed in so many 
different ways. That is why I am so pleased to be able to support this 
piece of legislation.
  I have had the privilege and honor to be in our schools that are 
recognized as the Blue Ribbon Schools and Schools to Watch, and those 
are wonderful. They are wonderful not just because of what has been 
accomplished for those kids, but they do become an inspiration to other 
schools to strive for and to achieve.
  What this piece of legislation does, Mr. Speaker, is to take that 
down to the staff level, because we know that the most valuable 
resource and asset that we have in our schools are people--not 
necessarily the classroom or anything that is physical like that, but 
it is the teachers, the faculty, and the staff. Being able to recognize 
the staff who work so hard each and every day there who are not 
necessarily teachers is a great opportunity.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I certainly am very excited about supporting 
this piece of legislation, H.R. 276. I urge my colleagues to vote 
``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.",T000467,2019-02-25

time.
  In closing, I would like to thank Representative Titus for her 
leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan piece of legislation.
  When it comes to delivering the promise of a great public school for 
every child, it is a team effort. Classified employees keep the lights 
on, students fed, and learning environments safe and welcoming.
  This past year, we have seen unprecedented activism from teachers and 
school staff demanding better support for public schools across the 
country. While the media often speaks first about the contributions and 
working conditions for classroom teachers, it is important to recognize 
that behind every teacher is an army of classified school employees.
  Passing this bill to recognize the contributions of classified school 
employees is an important first step, but I urge this body to do more. 
We must come together and continue to work across the aisle to invest 
in public education. We must invest in the staff who support our public 
schools and in students who count on public schools to reach their 
academic potential.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope that swift passage of H.R. 276 is just the 
beginning, and I look forward to future action in this Chamber in 
support of public schools. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I 
yield back the balance of my time.",L000590,2019-02-25

Moran, who was celebrated as the Hibernian of the Year by the Ancient 
Order of Hibernians, Monsignor Farrell Division on February 23, 2019. 
The Monsignor Farrell Division No. 2 Chapter of the Ancient Order of 
Hibernians and its founders exemplify the core principles of charity, 
concern for our fellow man, and commitment to educating students about 
the sacrifices and accomplishments of prior generations.
  A Carbondale native, Pat was born on August 31, 1953 to Joseph and 
Margaret Moran. Pat is a graduate of St. Rose High School, Class of 
1971. A veteran of the Navy, Pat worked at Tobyhanna Army Depot after 
discharge. He then moved to the greater Denver Area where he worked for 
Continental Air Lines before owning and operating his own business.
  Upon his retirement in 2012, Pat returned to Northeast Pennsylvania 
and became active in several local community organizations. Today, he 
is a member of the Columbia Hose Co. and the American Legion in 
Carbondale. Pat's involvement with the AOH began when he joined the 
organization's Golf League. He became increasingly involved in 
volunteer efforts by the AOH. He is currently a member of Ring and 
Shuffleboard leagues, as well as a volunteer bartender every Monday 
evening and for many Division functions.
  It is an honor to recognize Patrick Moran as he is named Hibernian of 
the Year by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Monsignor Farrell 
Division. I thank him for his service to his country in the U.S. Navy 
and his continued service to our community with the AOH. I congratulate 
him for receiving such an honor from his fellow brothers in the Ancient 
Order of Hibernians.

Stephen Bash on his retirement from the University of Illinois College 
of Medicine at Peoria.
  Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Dr. Bash decided to dedicate his life 
to medicine at a young age. He attended Indiana University at 
Bloomington before receiving his MD from Indiana University Medical 
School at Indianapolis. After his schooling, Dr. Bash served honorably 
in the U.S. Navy as a Lieutenant Commander.
  In his career, Dr. Bash has made Pediatrics a top priority. In 
private practice and in public service, Dr. Bash has made a lasting 
impact at every stop. He has held Directorships at both the Regional 
Sleep Apnea Center and at the Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization 
Laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Illinois at OSF St. Francis 
Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois. Dr. Bash has also dedicated time to 
research. He has been a Principal Investigator for two clinical studies 
and has been the author of many articles. To give back to his 
community, Dr. Bash has served on the Board of Directors for the Marvin 
Hult Health Education Center and Heartland Community Health Center.
  During his tenure, the medical community has had no better champion 
than Dr. Bash. He has always been a fierce advocate for the advancement 
of Pediatrics. Central Illinois will forever be grateful for Dr. Bash's 
years of service.

lost to gun violence in Aurora, Illinois, earlier this month.
  This is, unfortunately, not the first time that we have mourned the 
unnecessary loss of life from gun violence. Eleven years ago, when I 
first took office, I inherited a community in mourning: 17 students 
were injured and 5 were killed in the Cole Hall mass shooting at 
Northern Illinois University. So I spent my first weeks and months in 
office doing what I could to help my community recover.
  Now, 11 years later, on February 15, the call went out from Aurora, 
Illinois: Workplace shooting at Henry Pratt. Active gunman. Officers 
down.
  More than 200 police units from across the western suburbs of Chicago 
responded to contain the situation. They were running toward the sound 
of gunfire, as they do countless times each day in our country.
  Six officers were injured during that response, and, in the 
aftermath, we learned that we lost five members of our community:
  Josh Pinkard, the plant manager at Henry Pratt, who, when fatally 
shot, sent a final text message to his wife, Terra, to say ``I love 
you'';
  Trevor Wehner, on his first day at work at Pratt as an intern from 
Northern Illinois University;
  Clayton Parks, Trevor's supervisor and also a graduate of NIU;
  Vicente Juarez, a hardworking family man who lived with his wife, 
daughter, and grandchildren on a quiet street in Oswego;
  Russell Beyer, a mold operator and union committee chairman from 
Machinists Local 1202 and the father of two children.
  Now, as we have done so many times before in Congress, I will soon 
ask that we pause for a moment of silence; but this time, I would ask 
each of you to also think of the voting card that each of us carries on 
the House floor and the responsibility that you carry with that card, 
because this week we will finally be voting on legislation for 
effective and universal background checks for all gun sales. This is 
legislation supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and 
supported by 97 percent of the American people.
  So, our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victims left 
behind, and now I ask that we pause for a moment of silence.",F000454,2019-02-25

1485,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1435,0,Mr. BLUMENTHAL," Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today, with a heavy heart, I 
wish to pay tribute to Sergeant Rambo N557, a medically retired 
military working dog--MWD--who dedicated his life to the Marine Corps 
and raising awareness for his fellow retired working dogs. Sadly, 
Sergeant Rambo passed away earlier this month. He will be remembered 
for his loving spirit and lifetime of service.
  Sergeant Rambo served as an explosive detection MWD based out of MCCS 
Cherry Point, NC, from January 6, 2011, to April 11, 2012. Throughout 
his Active Duty, Sergeant Rambo completed 620 stateside searches, two 
official stateside missions, and about 1,000 hours of training. 
Unfortunately, a left shoulder injury prevented him from deploying. 
Nonetheless, he served valiantly alongside his handler, protecting 
their base and the community until retirement.
  Connecticut native Lisa Phillips, who served in the U.S. Army as a 
veterinary technician, adopted Sergeant Rambo after his retirement. 
Despite needing an amputation because of his earlier injury, he 
remained committed to serving his Nation.
  Well loved by people of all ages and capacities, Sergeant Rambo 
visited summer youth groups and local nursing homes, connecting with 
and bringing hope to children with special needs and elderly people 
suffering from dementia. His joyful and empathetic personality allowed 
him to bond with people across the Nation.
  Sergeant Rambo also used his experiences to highlight animal welfare, 
military, and veteran issues. He became the mascot for Alamo Honor 
Flight, accompanying World War II veterans to Washington, DC, and for 
Gizmo's Gift, a nonprofit that supports people who have adopted retired 
working dogs by offering free medical care and other necessary 
financial support. He and Lisa attended press events with me, helping 
gain backing for the Canine Members of the Armed Forces Act, which 
sought to improve care for MWDs once their Active Duty ends by 
streamlining the adoption process and establishing a national non-
profit to cover the veterinary costs associated with retired working 
dogs. Several provisions of that act have become law.
  In 2015, the American Humane Association named Sergeant Rambo the 
Military Dog of the Year. He and Lisa used this platform to give a TEDx 
Talk the next year about MWDs and Gizmo's Gift. Then, in March 2017, 
they testified before the Connecticut General Assembly about a bill to 
establish K-9 Veterans Day in our State.
  My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Lisa during 
this difficult time. We know without a doubt that Sergeant Rambo's 
legacy will leave a positive impact on the lives he touched and causes 
he championed for years to come.

1490,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1423,4,Mrs. MURRAY,"  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am on the floor to talk about a vote 
that simply should not have taken place this evening. It was a vote on 
yet another attack from our Republican colleagues on women's health and 
their right to access safe, legal abortions--this time in the form of 
an anti-doctor, anti-woman, anti-family piece of legislation that 
medical experts strongly oppose. Republicans have spread a lot of 
misinformation about this bill, so let's be clear what it is not about 
and what it is actually about.
  This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have 
claimed, because that is not up for debate, and it is already the law. 
This bill is also not at all about ensuring that appropriate medical 
care is delivered, because it would make it harder for healthcare 
providers to provide high-quality medical care that their patients need 
and deserve.
  The leading nonpartisan organization of OB/GYNs in our country has 
said this bill should never become law. It calls it ``gross legislative 
interference into the practice of medicine'' and ``part of a larger 
attempt to deny women access to safe, legal, evidence-based abortion 
care.'' In fact, 17 top health and medical organizations wrote to 
Congress to insist that Democrats and Republicans vote this bill down.
  Since this bill is not about infants or appropriate medical care, I 
am sure many people are wondering what exactly it is about. What would 
this bill really mean for women and families and healthcare providers?
  If you are a woman, this bill would mean, if you were one of the 
very, very few women who needed an abortion late in your pregnancy, you 
could be legally required to accept inappropriate, medically 
unnecessary care--care that may directly conflict with your wishes at a 
deeply personal, often incredibly painful moment in your life--because 
politicians in Washington decided their beliefs mattered more than 
yours.
  If you are a medical provider, this bill would supersede your years 
of medical training and your oath to deliver the best possible medical 
treatment to your patients. It would apply a one-size-fits-all set of 
requirements that does not reflect the reality that every pregnancy is 
different, and it would subject you to criminal penalties if you were 
to choose to let medical standards, not politics, drive the care you 
offer to your patients.
  For families who struggle with the painful reality that the children 
they had hoped for could not survive, as is tragically the case in many 
of the cases we are discussing, this legislation would take precedence 
over families' wishes as they grieve.
  This bill is government interference in women's healthcare, in 
families' lives, and in medicine on steroids. As I said, it is anti-
doctor, anti-woman, and anti-family. It has no place in becoming law. 
Its proponents claim it would make something illegal that is already 
illegal. So why are we debating this legislation that would take women 
backward when there are so many ways we should be advancing medicine, 
improving women's healthcare, and supporting families? As far as I can 
tell, it is because this bill is about something that Republicans care 
about more than almost any other priority; that, unfortunately, is the 
rolling back of women's constitutionally protected rights and trying to 
take us back in time before the Roe v. Wade decision.
  Since day No. 1 of the Trump-Pence administration, this party has 
pulled every possible stop to appeal to its extreme anti-abortion base. 
Just last week, the Trump-Pence administration put forward a rule that 
would prevent healthcare providers at clinics that are funded through 
the title X family planning program from so much as informing patients 
about where to get an abortion even if that patient directly asks them 
for advice. This rule means trusted medical providers across the 
country may not be able to serve women and men who rely on them for 
contraception, cancer screenings, and more--all because Republicans are 
determined to make abortion impossible in the United States. That is 
just one of many examples.
  To recap, this bill is completely unnecessary. It is harmful to women 
and families, and it would criminalize doctors. It is intended to do 
nothing except to help Republicans advance their goal of denying women 
their constitutionally protected rights. I am against it in the 
strongest terms. Everybody who cares about women, families, and doctors 
and about upholding the Constitution should be too, so I am glad the 
Senate voted tonight to stop this anti-doctor, anti-woman, anti-family 
bill from going a single step further.
  The next time Republicans want to have a conversation about 
protecting infants and children, I am happy to talk about the babies 
and children who have been separated from their parents at the border 
or about improving access to early childhood education or about making 
sure coverage for maternal healthcare and preexisting conditions is not 
taken away. These are problems that do exist and that do need to be 
solved, and we are just as ready and willing to work on those as we are 
to stand up and say ``absolutely not'' to this harmful bill.


                      Nomination of Eric D. Miller

  Mr. President, in the very near future, my Senate colleagues will be 
asked to take an unprecedented vote--a vote that never should have been 
scheduled here in the first place.
  Republican leaders are demanding that we move ahead and vote on 
President Trump's nominee to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court despite 
the fact that I and my colleague Senator Cantwell have not returned our 
blue slips on behalf of our constituents in Washington State and 
despite the fact that the hearing for the nominee was a total sham. 
This is wrong, and it is a dangerous road for the Senate to go down. 
Not only did Republicans schedule this nominee's confirmation hearing 
during a recess period when just two Senators--both Republicans--were 
able to attend, but the hearing included less than 5 minutes of 
questioning--less questioning for a lifetime appointment than most 
students face for a book report in school.
  Confirming this Ninth Circuit Court nominee without the consent or 
true input of both home State Senators and after a sham hearing would 
be a dangerous first for this Senate.
  This is not a partisan issue. This is a question of the Senate's 
ability and commitment to properly review nominees. Yet, here we are on 
the Senate floor, barreling toward a vote to confirm a flawed nominee, 
who came to us following a flawed nomination process--all because a 
handful of my Republican colleagues will apparently stop at nothing to 
jam President Trump's extreme conservatives onto our courts, even if 
that means trampling all over precedent, all over process, or any 
semblance of our institutional norms.
  Maybe Republican leaders are hoping most Americans aren't paying 
attention to what is happening right now in the Senate--that somehow 
tossing out Senate norms in order to move our country's courts to the 
far right will go unnoticed.
  Well, I am standing here right now to make sure everyone knows 
because I, for one, fear the short- and long-term consequences of 
letting any President steamroll the Senate on something as critical as 
our judicial nominees--the very men and women who are tasked with 
interpreting our Nation's laws and making sure they serve justice for 
all Americans.
  I fear the consequences of abandoning the blue-slip process and, 
instead, bending to the will of a President who has demonstrated time 
and again his ignorance and disdain for the Constitution and the rule 
of law.
  At a time when we have a President whose policies keep testing the 
limits of law--from a ban on Muslims entering the United States to a 
family separation policy at our southern border--it is very important, 
more than ever, that we have well-qualified, consensus judges on the 
bench.
  Let's be very clear. Trump cannot steamroll the Senate by himself. 
But in


the Republican leadership, he has found Members willing to throw out 
every rule, every tradition, every safeguard in the book to give him 
what he wants.
  So this vote, which is happening soon, and this new precedent of 
turning a blind eye to the blue slip should stop every one of my 
colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--in their tracks because, today, 
the two home Senators still holding their blue slips are my colleague 
Senator Cantwell and me, but in the future, it could be any Member of 
this body.
  I am doing this for very good reasons--reasons very much in line with 
why the blue-slip process exists in the first place. I am doing this 
because I don't believe Mr. Miller has received the necessary scrutiny 
and vetting to serve on the bench--a lifetime appointment. I believe 
the people I represent would not want him there, plain and simple.
  I want to briefly go into one area that causes particular and very 
serious concern, and that is what I have heard from my constituents 
about Mr. Miller's misunderstanding of Tribal sovereignty and his 
ability to be impartial and fair-minded when hearing cases involving 
Tribal rights.
  As one Tribal leader from my home State put it, Mr. Miller has built 
a career out of mounting challenges against Tribes, including their 
sovereignty, their lands, their religious freedom, and even the core 
attributes of Federal recognition.
  I want to be very clear because I do not believe that it is wise for 
Senators to support or oppose nominees only because of their past 
clients. Our legal system requires talented lawyers on both sides of 
every case, and sometimes lawyers represent clients who are politically 
unpopular.
  But making a career decision to be one of the top attorneys, in case 
after case, attacking Tribal sovereignty--that is more than a choice of 
a client. That is a choice about values, and it is something my 
colleagues should consider.
  There are more than 400 federally recognized Tribes in the Western 
United States, including Alaska. Every single one could find themselves 
before the Ninth Circuit and before a judge who spent years fighting 
for an extreme position directly opposed to their own sovereignty and 
whose advocacy repeatedly attempted to undermine the rights of Tribal 
nations everywhere. Particularly at a time when the Supreme Court may 
demolish important protections for subsistence rights, a circuit 
nominee opposed to Tribal sovereignty should not be confirmed.
  This is a serious matter worthy of true examination. Yet Mr. Miller's 
nomination process was inadequate from the start.
  Today it is Washington State families who are getting cut out from 
this important process. Tomorrow, it can be the concerns of any of your 
constituents and any of your home States that get tossed aside for a 
President's crusade to reshape our courts and satisfy a political 
base--and Senate leaders unwilling to stand up for our norms and our 
precedents and our constitutional duty.
  I urge my colleagues to truly think about what moving ahead with this 
nomination means and to ask themselves: Are we still able to work 
together in a bipartisan way and find common ground for the good of the 
country and the people we serve? Can we still engage in a bipartisan 
process to find consensus candidates to serve on our courts? Or will 
our work here in the U.S. Senate be reduced to partisan extremes and 
political gamesmanship?
  Will Republicans accept simply being a rubberstamp for their leader 
in the White House, and will my colleagues be complicit in allowing our 
courts to be taken over by ideology alone, abandoning pragmatism and a 
commitment to justice for all?
  That is the choice every Senator will make with this vote, and I 
sincerely hope a choice for which every Senator will be held 
accountable.
  To vote yes will be a vote in favor of further eroding the Senate's 
commitment to examining nominees for lifetime appointments and its 
ability to serve as a check on the Executive. To vote yes is to toss 
away each Senator's ability to provide guidance on judicial nominees 
for their State and the families they represent.
  To vote no will be a vote to stand up for the Senate's role in our 
democracy and to stand up for a process that helps the Senate ensure 
qualified judges who play such a critically important role in our 
democracy. To me, the choice is pretty clear.

1492,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1423,6,Mr. BOOZMAN,"  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join many of my 
colleagues in raising our voices on behalf of some of the most 
vulnerable members of our society.
  Recently, a very disturbing and revealing discussion has been taking 
place in our country that raises serious questions about how much value 
and worth we ascribe to babies in the womb, especially those who are 
born despite an attempted abortion procedure.
  Before I go any further, let me say this clearly and unequivocally: 
If we as a nation are to hold any claim to a moral character that 
deserves to be admired and emulated, then we must be willing to say 
that the lives of newborn children have inherent value and are worthy 
of protection. There is simply no way to credibly claim otherwise.
  Whether it be legislation introduced or enacted by State legislatures 
or comments made by public officials, such as the Governor of Virginia, 
our country has begun to entertain the idea that the rights and 
privileges newborn babies possess is an open-ended question.
  This is alarming, and the U.S. Senate should go on the record in 
defense of their right to live instead of being callously discarded or 
worse--intentionally killed in the name of reproductive freedom. There 
is no middle ground here.
  It is concerning to me that in some corners of this country, and even 
within this Congress, there is an utter failure to recognize and affirm 
the right to life, especially after an infant has already been born.
  Throughout my time in elected office, I have found that giving those 
who disagree with me on any given issue the benefit of the doubt as it 
relates to their motivations has allowed me to consistently find 
commonality and reach compromise, even with incredibly unlikely allies 
and partners. But in this instance, there can be no mistake or 
ambiguity. The common ground that we all must occupy should be a shared 
commitment to uphold the basic, fundamental right to protect the life 
of every child, no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, which 
brings me to the legislation before the Senate today.

  I am a cosponsor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, 
and I am grateful to each of my colleagues who supported the bill 
tonight. This legislation would create criminal penalties for doctors 
who allow infants to die rather than provide medical care after an 
attempted abortion.
  It would also require that born-alive abortion survivors be 
transported to a hospital for care and treatment rather than being left 
to languish on the counter of an abortion clinic or--as one former 
nurse and pro-life activist has shockingly recounted--be discarded 
along with the biohazard materials.
  Even in situations where comfort care is rendered to these little 
ones, that sometimes amounts to nothing more than keeping a baby warm 
until it passes away alone. No child should suffer this way.
  Under this bill, abortionists who defy these mandates to render care 
to born-alive survivors would face the justice that they are due 
instead of being ignored or permitted to continue committing 
infanticide.
  It is time for our country to demand that the victims of this 
abhorrent, inhumane treatment be afforded their rights and the 
perpetrators be held accountable.
  Speaking with one clear voice, we must say that every human being is 
made in the image of God and is therefore in possession of dignity and 
worth that cannot be displaced or dispossessed. Anything short of this 
unambiguous declaration would be a tremendous disservice to our 
children and fatally undermine the values of our society that we claim 
to uphold.


  While the debate surrounding abortion has engulfed this country for 
decades, the goalposts are now being shifted. Reproductive autonomy, we 
are now told, must include the ability and choice to end the life of a 
baby who survives an attempted abortion.
  As a former medical provider, I believe that to end a newborn's life 
either by refusing to provide lifesaving care or actively taking that 
child's life--as in the case of the infamous abortionist Dr. Kermit 
Gosnell and others--violates the oath every medical provider takes to 
do no harm.
  As a dad and a grandfather, I know from my own experience just how 
precious each life is. My daughters and grandchildren are treasured 
gifts that bring my family and me immeasurable joy. To think that they 
or any other child might be treated with anything other than the 
dignity and respect they are entitled to is tragic, heartbreaking, and 
outrageous.
  Providing necessary medical attention to save the lives of infants 
who survive an abortion is an imperative that we as a society must 
embrace if we are to be faithful to the promise our Founders made to 
the generations of Americans who would succeed them. In declaring the 
self-evident truth that all men are created equal, surely they intended 
to extend the same rights and liberties that their countrymen fought 
and died for to newborn babies who survive abortions.
  I am proud to have stood with my colleagues today in support of this 
legislation that seeks to protect these precious, vulnerable lives. We 
can and should do this as a reflection of the country we want to be.
  Our abortion laws in the United States already situate us among some 
of the world's worst human rights abusers, including North Korea and 
China.
  Now a national conversation about whether to provide children who 
survive abortions medical attention and care has ensued. It is my hope 
and prayer that the final word in this discussion will end with a 
resounding commitment to protect and preserve life.
  I would like to thank the junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Sasse, 
for leading on this critical issue and pushing to bring this measure to 
the floor today.
  I would also like to thank the President for his vocal commitment to 
defending life and protecting the most vulnerable among us.
  I feel blessed to stand alongside so many others to raise our voices 
on behalf of the voiceless.
  While I am disappointed with the result of today's vote, I remain 
committed to fighting for those who are unable to fight for themselves 
and will continue working to protect and uphold the sanctity of life.

1494,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1423,8,Mr. REED,"  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to offer some thoughts regarding the 
ongoing negotiations with North Korea that began with the Singapore 
summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un and will continue in a 
few days when the two leaders meet again in Vietnam.
  I join the chorus of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who 
have expressed concern regarding the outcome of the last summit and the 
subsequent negotiations. This is not meant as a criticism of the 
diplomatic process itself. Clearly, we are in a much better place now 
than 2 years ago, when the President was promising fire and fury for 
the Korean Peninsula, terrifying our South Korean allies, who stand to 
lose millions of their citizens in any confrontation with North Korea. 
Furthermore, if the Singapore summit had resulted in a clear path 
toward denuclearization, I would be standing here right now commending 
these diplomatic efforts.
  The maximum pressure campaign, significantly enhanced by this body's 
sanctions regime and the United Nations Security Council's resolutions, 
brought North Korea to the negotiating table. It was a golden 
opportunity and, unfortunately, it was squandered by this ill-prepared 
administration, which seems more concerned with photo ops than with the 
substance of the negotiation.
  The Singapore summit was a loss for the United States and our 
alliances and a great publicity win for North Korea. The 2005 six-party 
joint statement contained significantly more commitments from North 
Korea than the joint statement of the Singapore summit. Given President 
Trump's bluster and renouncement of the JCPOA, one would have thought 
that he would leave Singapore with an ironclad commitment and schedule 
for denuclearization. Instead, he got less than in any past negotiation 
with North Korea.
  Most concerning to me is that without obtaining a single concrete 
concession from North Korea, President Trump undermined our alliance 
with the Republic of Korea by characterizing our joint exercises as 
provocative war games. It was a huge propaganda win for North Korea and 
a huge loss to the United States and to the readiness of the joint 
force. The regularly scheduled exercises are very important to troop 
readiness and our regional security. While I understand the need to 
create diplomatic space for these negotiations to proceed, we must 
ensure that we do not sacrifice readiness for empty promises.
  While I am pleased with the agreement on the return of prisoners of 
war and missing-in-action personnel remains, which rightfully continue 
to be important issues for U.S. families, the Singapore summit was 
mostly pomp and circumstance that did not advance our national security 
interests. In fact, it could be said that we are in a worse position 
than we were before the summit. President Trump undeservedly 
transformed Kim Jong Un from a ruthless dictator to a world statesman 
in short order. He has since used his stature from the summit to make 
closed-door deals with China and Russia that will be used as leverage 
against the United States.
  The President also conferred legitimacy on a corrupt and morally 
bankrupt dictator who has imprisoned hundreds of thousands of men, 
women, and children in political camps under brutal conditions and has 
committed horrendous crimes against his neighbors and own people. Human 
rights did not play a prominent role at the summit, and the joint 
declaration does not include one single reference. If we want to 
continue to serve as a beacon for human rights, this issue will have to 
be on the agenda for these negotiations. There are a number of U.S. 
sanctions against North Korea because of its human rights record, and 
this body will not loosen those sanctions until and unless we see 
progress on the issue. As such, I was dismayed that the President in 
his State of the Union Address did not call out the North Korean 
regime's callous disregard for human rights.
  Since the summit, we have seen just how problematic the joint 
declaration has been as a foundational document for the negotiations. 
While Secretary Pompeo characterized the first meeting with North 
Korean negotiators at the summit as ``productive,'' the North Koreans 
criticized Secretary Pompeo's gangster-like demand for 
denuclearization. The chasm between the two sides was created by the 
ambiguity of the summit itself and its failure to create an agreed-upon 
path for both parties. We have not seen a substantial dismantlement of 
nuclear or missile sites over the last year, and independent news 
reporting reflects that North Korea continues to develop its nuclear 
and missile arsenals despite the self-imposed ban on testing.
  What should we have gotten from the summit? Since we played our 
biggest card and gave Kim Jong Un a meeting with the President of the 
United States, the answer is a lot more than what we did get. First and 
foremost, we should have gotten a joint declaration that North Korea 
agrees to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. If 
we were not going to get that commitment, then we should have at least 
gotten a specific commitment similar to the September 19, 2005, joint 
statement, where North Korea committed to ``abandoning all nuclear 
weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning at an early date to 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA 
safeguards.'' Instead, we got a vague statement that North Korea will 
``work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''


  Despite the administration's protestations to the contrary, it is not 
at all clear that North Korea actually agreed to complete, verifiable, 
and irreversible denuclearization, generally referred to as CVID. I am 
concerned, as are others, that the words ``complete denuclearization'' 
were used because the North Koreans would not agree to CVID. If that is 
the case, then, we are starting in a worse place than we were during 
the 2005 talks.

  Why do these words matter? They matter because of the historical 
context of these negotiations. Without the word ``verifiable,'' North 
Korea has not agreed to inspections, and, without inspections, we 
cannot be sure that North Korea will take the steps necessary to 
denuclearize. The regime does not have a good track record of living up 
to its agreements. Without a verification process that includes a 
robust inspection and verification regime, we will never be sure that 
North Korea is not reverting to its past tactics and cheating on its 
commitments.
  Even more alarming to those who follow past negotiations is that the 
commitment that did come out of the summit sounds suspiciously like the 
tack North Korea has taken in past negotiations--that denuclearization 
of the peninsula will require the United States to remove its nuclear 
umbrella from its ally, the Republic of Korea, and remove its troops 
from the peninsula. North Korea has peddled this tit-for-tat 
denuclearization narrative for years, and this administration must 
ensure that it does not become the narrative of the upcoming 
negotiations. These competing narratives should have been reconciled at 
the summit by the leaders but instead were left for future 
negotiations.
  The administration now has another opportunity in Vietnam to 
establish some credibility for these negotiations and demand a set of 
concrete deliverables. We should all recognize that CVID will take 
years to accomplish. Despite President Trump's patently false claim 
that he has solved the North Korean nuclear threat, that threat is 
still very real and very dangerous. There are commitments that we need 
from the other side to gauge whether North Korea is sincere in its 
intent to denuclearize. We already know that the intelligence community 
has made the determination that North Korea does not intend to 
denuclearize. Therefore, the concessions we seek from North Korea need 
to include a verification and inspection scheme that includes a 
reasonable timeline and is comprehensive enough to include all of its 
weapons of mass destruction programs and facilities and focuses on 
engagement instead of punishment. We should not use inspections as 
``aha'' moments to catch the North Koreans in intentional or 
unintentional mistakes. Instead, they should be used as the foundation 
to develop a comprehensive picture of all of North Korea's weapons 
programs and as the basis for future negotiations.
  What would a successful summit in Vietnam look like? We need a 
declaration from North Korea of all of its nuclear weapons and programs 
and facilities. Ideally, it would also include a catalog of all of its 
missiles and missile facilities. This declaration of all of its sites 
and programs needs to be provided to the United States in short order 
to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, 
inspectors to start the inspections process, which will take years.
  Second, we need North Korea to agree to verifiable denuclearization 
with IAEA inspections, and that agreement should include a concrete 
timeline with a step-by-step process. If we are going to continue to 
scope down our joint exercises for the sake of these negotiations, 
then, we need to see concrete actions by North Korea in the next few 
months. It has been almost a year since the last summit, and we have 
not seen any concrete irreversible actions taken by North Korea on its 
nuclear program that signify an intent by the regime to give up or 
significantly curtail its programs.
  I wanted to speak on this issue today before the second summit 
because I am concerned that the President will fall prey to North 
Korean manipulation and accept an agreement that does not include 
significant concessions by the regime. Kim Jong Un's ploy is to make 
commitments for the future that can easily be forgotten or to offer up 
facilities or sites that are obsolete.
  For example, if the President gets assurances for the dismantling of 
the Sohae launch facility and the closure and inspections of the 
Yongbyon nuclear facility, he may think that North Korea has moved the 
needle on denuclearization, but as the experts will tell you, the real 
jewels are other nuclear sites that are more critical for the regime's 
programs. As recent reports by the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies have shown, there are many missile sites that 
have not been declared and that are critical to the nuclear program. 
This is why a full declaration is so critical--so that we finally have 
a comprehensive accounting of the nuclear and missile programs that 
exist.
  In the meantime, the administration also needs to be vigilant that 
China and other countries continue to enforce sanctions. President 
Trump's assertions that the problem is solved will significantly 
undercut our ability to keep the pressure on. We need consistent 
messaging from the White House and the rest of the administration that 
the Singapore summit was the first step, and until we see concrete 
results, there will be no abeyance of the sanctions regime. Keeping 
China in line on that front will be a significant challenge, especially 
given the isolationist bent of this President, who has managed to 
alienate the very partners we need to cooperate on the sanctions 
regime.
  China does not need to state publicly that it will stop enforcing 
sanctions. Even low-level cross-border trade can allow the North Korean 
economy to hobble along for years, and all it will take is an 
indication from Beijing that sanctions enforcement is no longer a 
priority.
  Let me be clear. One of the most important outcomes of this process 
is also the preservation of our alliances with South Korea and Japan. 
Even if we were to somehow achieve a CVID deal with North Korea but 
lose our special relationships with these two nations, we will come out 
the other side less secure than we are today. While North Korea poses a 
significant threat to the United States, peace on the peninsula cannot 
come at the cost of a diminished U.S. presence in Asia. Our alliances 
and partners in the region are the bulwark of our strength in the 
region.
  Both South Korea and Japan have significant national security 
interests that will be adjudicated during these negotiations. Neither 
is at the negotiating table. I am very concerned that Japan in 
particular is dismayed that there has not been any substantive progress 
in the negotiations. It is critical that the administration continue to 
raise issues that are critical to Japan, especially the Japanese 
citizens who were abducted by North Korea. It is up to this 
administration to ensure that their interests are voiced and that their 
security needs are met. That means not only addressing North Korea's 
intercontinental ballistic missile program but also its short- and 
intermediate-range missiles. It means consulting with our allies before 
significant decisions that affect their security are taken, and it 
means not publicly lamenting about the costs associated with these 
historic and strategic alliances. We cannot simply put a price tag on 
our regional security. Losing these alliances will cost us far more in 
the long run and leave us far less secure than we are today.
  We also need to be concerned about the recent deterioration of the 
relationship between our two critical allies. Trilateral cooperation is 
only effective if South Korea and Japan can overcome their historical 
animosities to present a united front against North Korea.
  I know there is a lot of discussion today about the possibility of a 
peace agreement to end the 65-year-old armistice. I fear that many see 
a peace agreement as the precursor for a removal of U.S. forces from 
the Korean Peninsula. I am concerned that our President does not 
understand the critical importance of the deployment of U.S. Forces 
Korea on the peninsula.
  Let me be clear. The withdrawal of troops from the peninsula would 
significantly undermine our ability to fulfill our treaty obligations 
to South Korea. It should not be a subject of these negotiations or any 
future negotiations with North Korea. The presence of our troops is the 
cornerstone of our military alliance with South


Korea, and they must remain present and ready to ``Fight Tonight'' for 
the benefit of the alliance and regional security.
  Looming over all of this is our long-term strategic competition with 
China. I find it telling that China was one of the first countries to 
announce the cancellation of our joint exercises with the Republic of 
Korea.
  What are China's ambitions for this negotiation process? While China 
is certainly concerned about the nuclear arsenal its southern neighbor 
has amassed, denuclearization may not be China's highest national 
security concern during these negotiations. In the long run, China 
recognizes that its near-peer competition with the United States 
complicates its interests in these negotiations. China's highest 
priority is likely to ensure that it does not end up with a U.S.-allied 
reunified Korea on its southern border. Another goal is driving a wedge 
between the United States and its allies in order to promote itself as 
a regional hegemon.

  We all recognize that Russia has similar ambitions--separate us from 
our allies, establish themselves as regional hegemons, and coerce and 
bully their smaller neighbors on issues of defense, trade, and 
economics. We cannot allow that to happen.
  We already see attempts by China to relax sanctions enforcement. This 
trade spat is just one of the wedges North Korea will be able to 
leverage between China and the United States. We need a coordinated 
strategy that keeps our long-term interests in Asia focused while 
resolving the North Korean crisis. To date, we have not seen any 
indication that such a strategy exists.
  Peace on the Korean Peninsula has eluded us for decades. There is an 
opportunity now to force Kim Jong Un's hand, through skillful 
negotiation and a coordinated sanctions regime, to take concrete steps 
toward denuclearization.
  I hope this administration will use the Vietnam summit to negotiate a 
substantive agreement that keeps America and its allies safe, strong, 
and secure.

this bill to the floor for a vote.
  I am astonished--astonished--that we are debating whether it is 
appropriate to leave born children to die. Today, now, in the year of 
2019, how can this be? Science demonstrates that human life begins at 
conception, and our understanding of neonatal development is increasing 
every day.
  I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, 
Health and Human Services. The National Institutes of Health is one of 
my top priorities for funding. At the NIH, the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development has advanced our knowledge of 
pregnancy and development in the womb. Under this Institute, the 
Neonatal Research Network has pioneered research that has led to 
techniques that saved the lives of children in their earliest stages, 
when these children are at their most vulnerable.
  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than 10,000 
babies are aborted each year after 20 weeks of conception, when 
science--science--tells us that an unborn child can feel pain inside 
the womb. That number will increase as a result of recent State-level 
efforts to end virtually any restriction on abortion when a child could 
viably live outside the womb. These efforts are extreme and fall far 
beyond the mainstream of American opinion.
  This legislation does nothing to limit prenatal abortion. While we 
must address that issue--the root causes of abortion and the ways to 
curb this heartbreaking trend--that is not the issue at hand today in 
this legislation. The question before us is this: When a child survives 
an abortion and is born, does the U.S. Senate believe the child can 
still be eliminated, or should the baby be protected and given all 
possible care to survive? This act requires healthcare practitioners to 
``exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence 
to preserve the life and health of a child as a reasonably diligent and 
conscientious healthcare practitioner would render to any other child 
born alive at the same gestational age.'' Any negligence in this regard 
is subject to criminal and civil punishment, which at present does not 
exist.

  Should anyone think this is some made-up issue--despite the Virginia 
Governor's shocking comments revealing an openness to infanticide and 
New York's expansion of abortion well beyond the age of viability that 
makes born-alive abortion survivors more likely--we have concrete 
evidence that this grotesque act happens. Notorious abortion provider 
Kermit Gosnell is serving life in prison for these very acts.
  Closing our eyes to what is obscene does not make it any less real. 
That it is allegedly ``rare'' doesn't make it any less real or 
abhorrent. One child purposefully deprived of healthcare and allowed to 
die is one too many. It is infanticide, which brings us to the crux of 
this issue. We need to think carefully about the long-term impacts to 
the definition of ``healthcare'' if Congress refuses to act positively 
on this measure. Do the guardrails of neonatal health succumb to the 
belief that infants don't really count as one of us?
  Our society is not one of the ancient Romans or the Aztecs. We don't 
sacrifice our children to please an unknown god. In the progress of 
human history, principles of the enlightenment--also known as the Age 
of Reason--declared self-evident truths that all humans are created 
equal and endowed with the unalienable right to life. Although 
undoubtedly we have our flaws, these enlightenment principles enshrined 
in our founding documents remain true to who we are as a nation and who 
we are as human beings. We recoil when we hear of children who are 
harmed in any manner. Yet today we are faced with a reality where the 
ability to terminate an unborn child's life when it is viable outside 
of the womb is something that is not only tolerated but is passionately 
defended by the left.
  That is bad enough, but to see legislation ensuring that the medical 
care of born children gets blocked is incomprehensible. The immutable 
march of progress in human history has met a roadblock today in the 
U.S. Senate. The Age of Reason seems to have escaped us.
  Tonight, the Senate had an opportunity to send a message showing who 
we are as leaders and as a society as a whole--one that protects the 
weak and the voiceless instead of one that permits their destruction. I 
regret and I am saddened that the Senate failed this fundamental test.
  I am eager to do more to protect innocent life, including the unborn, 
but the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act provided us an opportunity to 
affirm the most basic need for healthcare for a vulnerable child who 
has already beaten the odds to survive. Let's hope we have another 
opportunity to give these children the chance at life they so deserve.
  I thank you.

                      Nomination of John L. Ryder
",,2019-02-25
1498,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1423,12,Mr. ALEXANDER,"  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this week, the Senate may see an 
extreme example of how the minority can abuse its rights in a way that 
provokes the majority into an excessive use of its power. I come to the 
floor to offer my Democratic colleagues a way to avoid both mistakes.
  Here is the abuse of minority rights: More than a year ago, President 
Trump nominated John Ryder of Memphis to serve on the board of 
directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority based on the recommendation 
that Senator Bob Corker and I made. Finally, this week, the Senate is 
likely to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination.
  You might say: Well, there must really be something wrong with Mr. 
Ryder.
  Well, if there is, then all the people who are supposed to find out 
what is wrong with Mr. Ryder have not found it out. Senator Corker and 
I know him very well as one of Tennessee's finest


attorneys. Senator Blackburn agrees. After a hearing at which Mr. Ryder 
answered questions, Republican and Democratic members of the 
Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved his 
nomination. No, there is no problem with Mr. Ryder.
  You might say: This must be a position of overwhelming complexity and 
importance that requires a year for all of us to think about it.
  TVA is the Nation's largest public utility, and it is important to 
the millions of us in the seven-State region for whom it provides 
electricity. But this is not a lifetime appointment. It is not a 
Cabinet position. It is not even a full-time position. This is one of 
nine part-time board positions whose nominees are usually approved in 
the Senate by a voice vote.
  The problem is not with Mr. Ryder. It is not because of the unusual 
importance of the position. The problem is with the determination of 
the Democratic minority to make it nearly impossible for President 
Trump to fill the 1,200 Federal Government positions that require 
confirmation by the U.S. Senate as part of our constitutional duty to 
provide advice and consent.
  This is where we are: Democrats have objected to the majority 
leader's request to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination. As I mentioned, 
these are nominations normally approved by a voice vote. So in order to 
have a vote, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has filed a 
cloture petition to cut off debate on Mr. Ryder's nomination.
  The cloture process takes at least 3 days. Here is how it works: The 
first day, you file cloture. That is what Senator McConnell did. The 
second day is a so-called intervening day when no action can be taken, 
so nothing is happening. On the third day, the Senate votes to invoke 
cloture, and then there is up to 30 more hours for postcloture debate 
before the Senate can finally vote on whether to confirm Mr. Ryder.
  Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder is not the only victim of such 
obstructionism. During the last 2 years, Democrats have done what I 
just described 128 times. One hundred and twenty-eight times they have 
required the majority leader to consume up to 3 days to force a vote on 
a Presidential nominee. By comparison, requiring a cloture vote to 
advance a nomination happened 12 times during the first 2 years of 
President Obama's term, compared to President Trump's 128 times; 4 
times during the first 2 years of George W. Bush's term, compared to 
President Trump's 128 times; 12 times during Bill Clinton's first 2 
years, compared to President Trump's 128 times. Not once during George 
H. W. Bush's first 2 years in office was it necessary for the majority 
leader to file cloture to cut off debate to advance a Presidential 
nomination--not once--but it had to be done 128 times in the first 2 
years of President Trump's time.
  This unnecessary obstruction has to change. The result of this 
extraordinary delay in considering nominees creates a government filled 
with acting appointees who, never having gone through the Senate 
confirmation process, are less accountable to Congress and therefore 
less accountable to the American people. So at a time when many 
complain that the Executive has become too powerful, the Senate is 
deliberately making itself weaker by diminishing our constitutional 
duty to advise and consent to individuals nominated to fill important 
positions--perhaps the Senate's best known role.
  This abuse of power by the minority is about to produce an excessive 
reaction by the majority--something that I think at least nine 
Democratic Senators who can see 2 years ahead would want to avoid. At 
least nine Democratic Senators hope to be the next President of the 
United States. Do they not know that some Republicans will do to the 
next Democratic President's nominees what Democrats have done to 
President Trump's nominees? Let me ask that again. Do the nine 
Democratic Senators who want to be the next President of the United 
States--that election is about 20 months away--not know that if they 
are elected, some Republicans will do to them what Democrats have done 
to President Trump's nominees?
  The Senate is a body of precedent. What goes around comes around. All 
it takes will be one Republican Senator objecting to a unanimous 
consent request to make it difficult for the next Democratic President 
to form a government, and this will continue the diminishment of the 
U.S. Senate.
  Can Republican Senators, by majority vote, change Senate rules to 
stop this obstruction? Yes, we can, and we will, if necessary. There 
are several ways to change the rules of the Senate. We can amend the 
standing rules of the Senate. We can adopt a standing order. We can 
pass a law. We can set a new precedent. We can change the rules by 
unanimous consent. All of these are rules of the Senate.
  The written rules of the Senate say it requires 67 votes to amend a 
standing rule and 60 votes to amend a standing order. There is recent 
precedent to change the Senate rules by a majority vote.
  In 2013, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, used a procedural 
maneuver--let's call it the Harry Reid precedent--that allowed the 
Democratic Senate majority to overrule the Chair and say, in effect, 
that a written Senate rule does not mean what its words say.
  Now, this is as if a referee in a football game were to say the 
following: The rule book says that a first down is 10 yards, but I am 
the referee, and I am ruling that a first down is 9 yards.
  Well, that is what happened in 2013. So, in 2017, what goes around 
comes around. The Republican majority followed this Harry Reid 
precedent in order to make cloture on all nominations a majority vote, 
and now Republicans are on the verge again of following the Harry Reid 
precedent.
  Should Republicans do this, change a rule by majority vote, even 
though our written rules say it should be done by 60 or 67 votes? The 
answer is, no, we shouldn't, not if we can avoid it.
  As Senator Carl Levin said in 2013, when he opposed the Harry Reid 
precedent--Senator Levin is a Democrat, and he said: A Senate in which 
a majority can change its rule at any time is a Senate without any 
rules.
  Thomas Jefferson, who wrote our first rules, said: It didn't make 
much difference what the rules are. It just matters that there are some 
rules.
  So it is at least awkward for Members of the country's chief rule-
writing body, the U.S. Senate, to expect Americans to follow the rules 
we write for them when we don't follow our own written rules.
  I have heard many Democrats privately say to me, they express their 
regret that they ever established the Harry Reid precedent in 2013. 
They didn't look ahead and see that what goes around comes around and 
that this is a body of precedent.
  So what would be the right thing for us to do--something that avoided 
both the minority's abuse of its rights and the majority's excessive 
response. We should do what the Senate did in 2011, in 2012, and in 
2013, when Republicans and Democrats worked together to make it easier 
for President Obama and his successors to gain confirmation of 
Presidential nominees.
  As a Republican Senator, I spent dozens of hours on this bipartisan 
project to make it easier for a Democratic President with a Democratic 
Senate majority to form a government. I thought that was the right 
thing to do, and we changed the rules in the right way.
  The Senate passed standing orders with bipartisan support and a new 
law, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, 
which eliminated confirmation for several positions. That bipartisan 
working group of Senators accomplished a lot in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
  We eliminated secret holds. After over 25 years of bipartisan effort, 
led by Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, we eliminated delays caused 
by the reading of amendments. We eliminated Senate confirmation of 163 
major positions.
  Now, remember what we were doing was working in a bipartisan way to 
try to make it easier for President Obama and a Democratic majority in 
the Senate to confirm the 1,200 Presidential nominees that every 
President has to send over here for advice and consent. We did it for 
President Obama. We intended to do it for his successors as well.
  We eliminated 3,163 minor career positions. We made 272 positions so-
called privileged nominations, which means these nominations can move 
faster through the Senate. We sped up motions to proceed to 
legislation. We made it easier to go to conference. We


limited postcloture debate on sub-Cabinet positions to 8 hours and on 
Federal district judges to 2 hours for the 113th Congress. All of these 
changes took effect immediately over these 60 days.
  Let me underscore what I am about to say. Republicans did not insist, 
in 2011, 2012, and 2013, when Barack Obama was President, that these 
new rules should be delayed until after the next Presidential election 
when there might be a Republican President. Republicans supported these 
changes for the benefit of this institution, even though they would 
immediately benefit a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate 
majority.
  I propose that we do that again. I invite my Democratic colleagues to 
join me in demonstrating the same sort of bipartisan respect for the 
Senate as an institution that Senators Reid and McConnell--the two 
Senate leaders at that time--Senators Schumer, Barrasso, Levin, McCain, 
Kyl, Cardin, Collins, Lieberman, and I did in 2011, 2012, and 2013, 
when we worked to change the Senate rules the right way.
  Now, 2 weeks ago, the Rules Committee gave us an opportunity to do 
things again in the right way by reporting to the Senate a resolution 
by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt, the chairman of the Rules 
Committee. This resolution, which is similar to the standing order that 
78 Senators voted for on January 14, 2013, would reduce postcloture 
debate time for nominations. Remember, that is after day one, the 
majority leader files cloture; day two, nothing happens; day three, we 
have a vote on cloture that is by 51 votes, and we would reduce the 
time for debate on day three. District judges would be debated for 2 
hours, the same as the 2013 standing order that 78 Senators voted for. 
Other sub-Cabinet positions would be subject to 2 hours of postcloture 
debate as well.
  The proposal offered by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt would not 
reduce the postcloture debate time for Supreme Court Justices, for 
Cabinet members, for circuit court or certain Board nominations, like 
the National Labor Relations Board, but would divide the 30 hours of 
postcloture debate equally between Republicans and Democrats.
  The Lankford-Blunt proposal would put the Senate back where it has 
historically been on nominations. With rare exceptions, Senate 
nominations have always been decided by majority vote. Let me say that 
again. With rare exceptions, Senate nominations have always been 
decided by majority vote.
  President Johnson's nomination of Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court was the only example of a Supreme Court nominee who was 
blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.
  There has never been, in the history of the Senate, a Cabinet nominee 
who was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes. There has never been, 
in the history of the Senate, a Federal district judge whose nomination 
was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.
  Since 1949, Senate rules have allowed one Senator to insist on a 
cloture vote; that is, 60 votes, which requires more than a majority to 
end debate. Even though it was allowed, it just wasn't done. Even the 
vote on the acrimonious nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme 
Court was decided by a majority vote of 52 to 48. Not one Senator tried 
to block the nomination by requiring 60 votes on a cloture motion, even 
though one Senator could have done that.
  Only when Democrats began, in 2003, to block President George W. 
Bush's nominees by insisting on a 60-vote cloture vote did that 
tradition change. Then, in 2017, using the Harry Reid precedent, 
Republicans restored the tradition of requiring a majority vote to 
approve all Presidential nominees, which, as I have said, has been the 
tradition throughout the history of the Senate.
  Also, until recently, with rare exceptions, nominations have been 
considered promptly. After all, there are 1,200 of them, and the Senate 
has other things to do besides just being in the personnel business.
  For example, last month, I was in Memphis for the investiture of Mark 
Norris, whose nomination languished for 10 months on the Senate 
calendar. The evening before, I had dinner with 94-year-old Harry W. 
Wellford. In November of 1970, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee had 
recommended Harry Wellford to serve as a district court judge on the 
same court where Mark Norris now serves.
  By December 11, 1970, 1 month later, President Nixon had nominated 
Harry Wellford, and the Senate had confirmed him. All this happened in 
1 month. Not all nominations have moved that fast. In 1991, a 
Democratic Senator, using a secret hold, blocked President George H. W. 
Bush's nomination of me as U.S. Education Secretary. I waited on the 
calendar for 6 weeks. Those 6 weeks seemed like an awfully long time to 
me, and that was for a Cabinet position. It was not 10 months for a 
part-time position for the Tennessee Valley Authority.
  Two weeks ago, I voted to report Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt's 
resolution to the full Senate, even though no Democrat voted for it. I 
will vote for it again on the floor, even if no Democrat will join us. 
I will also join my fellow Republicans, if we are forced to change the 
rules by majority vote. I do not like the Harry Reid precedent, but I 
like even less the debasement of the Senate's constitutional power to 
provide advice and consent to 1,200 Presidential nominees.
  My preference is to adopt the Lankford-Blunt resolution, which is 
very similar to the 2013 resolution that 78 Senators voted for, and to 
do it in a bipartisan way, according to the written Senate rules as we 
did in 2013.
  I believe most Democrats privately agree that the resolution offered 
by Senators Lankford and Blunt is reasonable, and they will be grateful 
that it is in place when there is a Democratic majority and one 
Republican Senator can block a Democratic President's nominees.
  The only objection Democrats seem to have to the Lankford-Blunt 
resolution is that it would apply to President Trump. Their other major 
objection, which is truly puzzling, is that the proposed change is 
permanent, and the change we made in 2013 was temporary. Well, I wonder 
if Democrats would like it better if we made this change in the Senate 
temporary, only applying to the remainder of President Trump's term.
  This is my invitation to my Democratic colleagues. Join me and 
Senators Lankford and Blunt in supporting their resolution, or 
modifying it if you believe there is a way to improve it, and working 
in a bipartisan way, exactly as we did in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
  A year or so ago, one of the Supreme Court Justices was asked: How do 
you Justices get along so well when you have such different opinions? 
This Justice's reply was this: We try to remember that the institution 
is more important than any of our opinions.
  We Senators would do well to emulate the Supreme Court Justices in 
respecting and strengthening this institution in which we are 
privileged to serve. One way to do that is to join together to restore 
the prompt consideration of any President's 1,200 nominees and do it in 
a bipartisan way that shows the American people our written rules mean 
what they say.",A000360,2019-02-25

1500,AMERICANS' SHIFTING VIEWS ON ABORTION,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2089-3,0,Mr. LaMALFA,"  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a recent shift 
we have seen in this country over the recent weeks--that is Americans' 
views on abortion.
  Not long ago, a Marist poll found that 55 percent of Americans were 
likely to identify as pro-choice compared to about 38 percent 
identifying as pro-life--indeed, a 17-point gap. Now, the polls are 
tied.
  As reported this week by Axios, a similar Marist poll found that 
Americans are now, for the first time, equally likely to be pro-life as 
they are to be pro-choice, both registering at 47 percent.
  Why the sudden change? The horrific rhetoric offered by some of the 
left, that is why, including the Virginia Governor's indefensible 
remarks that he would support the murder of a baby post-birth. It is 
inconceivable to me that someone could differentiate a post-birth 
``abortion'' from actual murder.
  The good news is I think most Americans agree with me. That is why we 
are seeing, finally, this dramatic shift.
  My colleague from Missouri, Representative Ann Wagner, has introduced 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in order to end 
infanticide taking place after failed abortion attempts. The Democrats 
have repeatedly blocked the effort, including tonight. We need to have 
a vote on this bill.

  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to put before the House today H.R. 
539.
  The House passed a nearly identical bill, H.R. 5086, in the 115th 
Congress and, unfortunately, that is as far as the bill got. Hopefully, 
we can get more movement on it this time around, get it through the 
Senate, and to the President's desk for his signature.
  Mr. Speaker, the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act is a bill I 
introduced to spur entrepreneurship and turn American innovation into 
American jobs. This bill expands the National Science Foundation's 
highly successful Innovation Corps, or I-Corps program, a program I am 
proud to have championed since its inception in 2011.
  I-Corps teaches scientists and engineers, including many women and 
underrepresented minorities, how to turn their federally-funded 
laboratory research into successful products and services.
  The program has educated more than 1,300 teams, representing 271 
universities in 47 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
It has been linked to almost 650 startup companies that have raised 
almost $300 million in follow-on funding.
  In the 114th Congress, I led the effort that authorized I-Corps and 
expanded its reach to other agencies, including the National Institutes 
of Health, NASA, and the Department of Energy.
  The Federal Government invests billions of dollars in research and 
development annually, both at government facilities, such as national 
labs, and at universities and research institutions. I-Corps is a 
modest investment that leads to a higher return on our research 
spending by significantly increasing rates of commercialization, 
economic activity, and job creation.
  Our economy is driven by the ingenuity of our scientists and 
engineers, developing innovations today that become tomorrow's great 
products. And yet, still only a small minority of federally-funded 
research with commercial potential ever makes it to the marketplace. 
The I-Corps program helps to change that.
  This bill expands I-Corps to meet some pressing needs.
  First, it helps more people participate in the program. Right now, 
unless you are a grantee of NSF or another agency with an I-Corps 
program, the training can be difficult to access. This bill will give 
recipients of small business grants from any Federal agency the 
flexibility to pay for I-Corps with their grant funds, and will also 
allow other entrepreneurs to apply and pay out-of-pocket to 
participate.
  Second, the bill directs NSF to establish a new course as part of the 
I-Corps program to teach scientist-entrepreneurs how to start and grow 
a company. While the current I-Corps course does a great job of helping 
scientists and engineers determine who their customers are and whether 
their innovation is suitable for commercialization, it offers only 
limited guidance on what to do after a scientist makes the decision to 
become an entrepreneur.
  Skills like how to write a business plan, hire a team, and attract 
investment are taught in business schools, but not in Ph.D. programs. 
NSF recognized this need and has already begun a pilot program to test 
curriculum for this new course. This bill will make sure the new course 
is fully developed and made available around the country.
  Finally, this bill requires a GAO assessment of the I-Corps program, 
its first comprehensive, independent evaluation since it was created. 
Although the program's success to date speaks for itself, it is 
important to continuously improve it by developing metrics to measure 
its performance and ensure that Federal funds are well spent.
  This bill has been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders, 
including the ``father of modern entrepreneurship,'' who developed the 
curriculum that I-Corps is based on, Steve Blank; the former NSF 
program officer, who founded the program, Dr. Errol Arkilic; and

  This bill is also endorsed by the Information Technology and 
Innovation Foundation, the National Venture Capital Association, the 
Association of American Universities; the Council on Governmental 
Relations; and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 539, the Innovators to 
Entrepreneurs Act of 2019.
  H.R. 539 extends the outreach of the National Science Foundation's 
Innovation Corps program, also known as I-Corps.


  I-Corps trains and prepares scientists and engineers to take their 
research from the lab and turn it into commercial products and 
services.
  Research labs are making breakthroughs in new fields like quantum 
computing, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering. These 
breakthroughs will continue to transform our lives and the world we 
live in.
  But many scientists and engineers are not trained for commercializing 
these discoveries and did not go to business school or take any 
business development classes. I-Corps gives researchers the tools to 
maximize the taxpayer investment in basic research and spur innovation.
  H.R. 539 expands the eligible pool for I-Corps courses and allows a 
portion of Federal small business grants be used to cover I-Corps 
training expenses.
  The bill also allows any private citizen to apply to participate and 
pay out-of-pocket.
  Finally, H.R. 539 authorizes a new I-Corps boot-camp course that 
teaches valuable skills, like structuring a company, attracting 
investors, and hiring staff.
  In my district, Oklahoma State University has a successful support 
system for business startups, both on and off campus. I-Corps is a key 
part of that system, helping students and faculty learn how to 
commercialize their ideas and build a business.


  H.R. 539 will help programs like the one at OSU grow and become self-
sustaining.
  I want to thank Representative  Dan Lipinski and Representative  Dan 
Webster for their work on this legislation. I also want to thank my 
friend and our new chairwoman of the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee, Eddie Bernice Johnson, for her work in advancing this 
bipartisan bill.

yielding me time.
  I rise today to support and ask my House colleagues to pass H.R. 539, 
the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act.
  I would like to issue a special thanks to my friend  Dan Lipinski, 
who introduced this legislation, and he continues to serve as a 
champion for the time-proven I-Corps program.
  The Innovation Core program was created by the National Science 
Foundation in 2011 to teach scientists and engineers how to turn their 
laboratory innovations into successful commercial products and 
services. I know engineers are lacking in that area. I am one. I think 
I invented, before I was 21 years old, about three or four, maybe five, 
things which were really awesome; but nobody bought them except me, and 
it wasn't good.
  So this program assists scientists and engineers in the development 
of their academic research and equips them to bring research into a 
private market where jobs can be created and money can be won through 
that. We witnessed the wonderful success of this program in my home 
State of Florida, the University of Central Florida.
  H.R. 539 expands the I-Corps program to create a new course in 
commercial-ready companies. Individuals who have completed an existing 
I-Corps course would be eligible for this new course which will help 
them create, market, and, eventually, expand their private-sector 
company.
  This bill breaks down the barriers experienced by current scientists 
when attempting to bring their product to market. Through marketing, 
hiring, organizing, and attracting investors, these participants can 
have a better shot at not only success, but also increasing, 
dramatically, their business.
  Additionally, H.R. 539 expands the number of groups eligible to apply 
to the I-Corps program and offers new options on how to initially pay 
for the course.",W000806,2019-02-25

Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2019.
  I want to thank Mr. Lipinski, Chairwoman Johnson, Ranking Member 
Lucas, and Mr. Webster for all the hard work they have put into this 
important legislation.
  Entrepreneurship is hard; it is risky; it is the road less traveled; 
it is an all-encompassing journey that tests every ounce of strength 
and skill that those bold enough to pursue it have to offer; and its 
successful practice is essential to the future prosperity of our 
Nation.
  The bill we are considering today takes the breakthrough lessons of 
customer development first codified by Steve Blank, whose teachings are 
engrained in the conscience of many business school students--but less 
of our Ph.D. students--and forms the basis of the NSF I-Corps program, 
a program that has already proven its worth at turning breakthrough 
scientific research into successful commercial enterprise.
  Since this program was created in 2011, more than 600 startups have 
been formed through the various I-Corps sites, including in my home 
State of Ohio at the University of Akron, The Ohio State University, 
and the University of Toledo.
  As just one example, University of Akron I-Corps startup Fontus Blue 
provides decisionmaking software that helps water treatment plants to 
produce consistently excellent drinking water. The software is used by 
plants in 24 cities across the U.S., Canada, and Brazil.
  The bill before us today expands upon the success of the current 
program by opening up access to small business innovation research 
grantees and also private individuals. Additionally, this bill allows 
small business innovation research grants and the small business 
technology transfer grants to be used to access I-Corps training.
  Finally, this bill would require I-Corps to develop a course for 
commercialization-ready teams to help them learn the skills needed to 
attract investors, build a brand, and scale a business.
  As we confront the economic challenges of the 21st century, it will 
be our innovators and entrepreneurs who will create solutions to these 
seemingly intractable problems by channeling the entrepreneurial spirit 
and force of will that has driven our country to its greatest economic 
heights.
  The Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act safeguards our economy by 
empowering future generations of entrepreneurs in all corners of our 
country to turn their wildest dreams into our collective achievements.
  Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this bill, I encourage my colleagues 
to support this legislation.",G000588,2019-02-25

dedicated and diligent work over this decade on this subject matter. I 
think we will all be better off for it. I know those folks who utilize 
the program and will have greater opportunities to utilize the program 
will benefit all of us as a society.

consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank full committee Chairwoman Eddie 
Bernice Johnson for cosponsoring. I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas, 
Mr. Gonzalez, and Mr. Webster for cosponsoring--Mr. Webster as the lead 
Republican cosponsor on this bill now and in the previous Congress.
  Mr. Webster talked about being an engineer. I was an engineer and 
then an academic; although, I wasn't an academic as an engineer. I was 
a political scientist. But I understand that a lot of scientists, 
engineers, political scientists have a lot of great ideas, a lot of 
great research.
  We as taxpayers put a lot of money into this research. There are a 
lot of


great ideas that come out of it, the possibility for great innovations.
  I will always remember when I first met with Steve Blank and saw him 
teaching the course that was the basis for I-Corps out of Stanford 
University. I thought this made complete sense to me, to be able to 
teach scientists and engineers, teach them how to be entrepreneurs, 
teach them how to develop ideas into new products, new services, and, 
hopefully, new American jobs.
  The I-Corps program has been one of the most successful programs that 
I have seen during my time in Washington, D.C. This bill will help to 
advance that, and in doing so, help advance American innovation. I 
think that is a goal that we can all embrace.
  So I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and, hopefully, we will 
work on it and get it through the Senate and to the President's desk, 
because I think this will be a great victory for our country.

to Entrepreneurs Act of 2019. I thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership 
on this bipartisan legislation and look forward to working with him to 
see it through to the President's desk.
  Each dollar the U.S. invests in research grants at our universities 
is a dollar toward the birth of potentially game-changing discoveries 
and innovation. Innovation is the lifeblood of our economy. The job 
creation and economic security gains created by scientific advances can 
only be enjoyed if we fully support the innovation ecosystem from 
discovery to commercialization. Finding ways to maximize the benefits 
of federally funded research is critical to U.S. competitiveness in the 
global market.
  H.R. 539 does just that. This bill creates a link between two of our 
most important programs that focus on creating a sustainable path from 
laboratory to market for valuable scientific research. This bill 
expands participation in the Innovation Corps Program to Small Business 
Innovation Program grantees. Started at the National Science 
Foundation, the Innovation Corps program, or I-Corps, helps prepare 
scientists and engineers to think beyond the university lab and gives 
them the skills to identify products with commercial potential and to 
be successful entrepreneurs. The Small Business Innovation Program and 
Small Business Technology Transfer Program, known as SBIR and STTR, are 
valuable programs that provide competitive research and development 
grants and contracts to innovative small businesses.
  H.R. 539 also seeks make available specialized I-Corps courses in all 
aspects of preparing a product to go to market. This is a vital 
component which can help identify market failures and premature 
business formation. Unfortunately, too many innovative ideas do not 
make it to the commercialization phase. This bill will help increase 
those odds.
  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 539.",J000126,2019-02-25

McFadden and congratulate her on a remarkable 40-year career at WNDU-
TV. I want to take a moment to honor the iconic legacy Maureen is 
leaving behind at WNDU-TV and thank her for all she has done for 
Michiana communities.
  A lifelong Hoosier, Maureen has been a fixture in South Bend as a 
reporter and anchor at WNDU Newscenter 16 for the past four decades. 
She has played a vital role in making northern Indiana stronger, not 
only by bringing us the day's news but by always finding ways to serve 
her neighbors and give back to the community she loves to call home.
  Generations of viewers have gotten to know Maureen as she delivers 
the local news each night. Her career in journalism began in her 
hometown of South Bend, and though she will soon anchor her last WNDU-
TV newscast, her retirement is far from the end of her positive impact. 
She displays a strong sense of affection and pride for our community 
when sharing the stories of our fellow Hoosiers. Her steadfast 
commitment to shining a light on important issues, encouraging 
community service, and keeping Hoosiers informed and engaged is why 
Maureen has become such a beloved household name.
  I am grateful to Maureen not only for her excellence in journalism, 
but also for the incredible example she has set for aspiring 
journalists and young Hoosier women looking to give back and build a 
brighter future.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
exceptional character, leadership, and compassion Maureen has 
demonstrated both on and off the air. I wish Mo the very best.

1528,RECOGNIZING PATIENT ADVOCATE BILL HAHN AND THE MANY SELFLESS AMERICANS WHO WORK ON BEHALF OF THOSE STRUGGLING WITH KIDNEY DISEASE,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE202-4,0,Mr. POSEY,"  Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, on March 5, 2019, Citizens from across the 
country will gather in our nation's Capital to help raise awareness 
about kidney disease and advocate for public policy solutions as part 
of the National Kidney Foundation's Annual Patient Advocacy Summit. In 
all my years of service, I have yet to meet more caring and tireless 
advocates.
  Their advocacy is important because of the number of people kidney 
disease affects--nearly one in three adults are at risk of developing 
kidney disease. Nearly thirty million Americans have kidney disease and 
approximately ninety percent don't even know it. It sneaks up on you 
and that's why raising awareness is a key component to combating this 
disease and ultimately saving lives.
  Sadly, on October 10, 2018, we lost one of our great advocates and 
champions--our friend Bill Hahn of Rockledge, Florida, passed away. 
Bill was one of those unspoken heroes who got up every morning and 
fought to keep going, for himself, and so many other people struggling 
with kidney disease, recovering from transplant surgery and waiting to 
receive the special gift of life.
  From an early age, Bill believed in physical fitness and leading a 
very active and healthy life. As a young man he was a male model and 
later a professional surfer with the famous Salick surf team winning 
numerous awards. A graduate of Florida State University, he owned and 
operated a successful health fitness business selling exercise 
equipment in Melbourne, Florida. Even with his dedication to a daily 
exercise regiment, at the age of twenty-six, Bill was diagnosed with 
Type 1 Diabetes.
  Living with Diabetes can be a difficult struggle, even for someone as 
physically fit as Bill Hahn. Over time the disease began to take a toll 
on Bill's health as he suffered from many of its complications 
including blindness, nerve damage and even coma. Unfortunately, Bill 
suffered renal failure at age fifty-one, but his physical routine never 
stopped. When Bill was on dialysis, he was walking ten miles a day. And 
because of his fitness level, he was a good candidate for transplant 
surgery. On New Year's Eve 2008, Bill received a true gift of life--a 
new kidney and pancreas.
  Since his surgery, Bill dedicated his life to helping patients 
struggling with kidney disease and other serious medical conditions. In 
2012 he joined with surfing legend and fellow transplant recipient Rich 
Salick and co-founded the annual Cocoa Beach ``Footprints in the Sand'' 
Kidney Walk. Katie and I have been involved in the Kidney Walk each 
year and it continues to grow and draw participation from all over 
Central Florida thanks in large part to Bill's work and other 
volunteers from our community.
  Bill was a constant advocate for this cause, especially in the last 
years of his life. And, if you knew Bill Hahn, helping others is what


kept him going. He worked closely with my office on various projects 
throughout the years and brought to my attention many important pieces 
of legislation moving through Congress that are critical to winning 
this battle. In 2017 Bill lead a successful effort to declare May 13th 
``Living Kidney Donor Day'' in the State of Florida. He is also the 
author of three books including More Than A Conqueror Legacy, a 
spiritual healing guide for patients; The Silver Lining, a chronicle of 
Bill's journey through recovery; and The Window Box, a book of poetry.
  I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing the efforts of Bill Hahn and the many other Americans 
who have worked tirelessly to raise awareness about kidney disease and 
advocate for patients in need.

1529,HONORING THE KOREAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE200,0,Mr. PASCRELL,"  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the outstanding 
achievements of the people of South Korea in their fight for 
independence. This push for Korean independence from Japan would begin 
in Seoul on March 1, 1919 and spread throughout the country.
  Over 100 years ago, the Korean people were inspired by former 
Governor of New Jersey and United States President Woodrow Wilson's 
ideas of self-determination to resist the occupation of Japanese 
military rule. This revolutionary spirt was aided by release of a 
Korean Declaration of Independence that was written by 33 core 
activists in the Samil Movement. The declaration was read by the 
leaders in the Seoul and in townships throughout Korea by supporters of 
the movement.
  Attempts by the Japanese military to suppress the Samil Movement's 
peaceful gatherings gave their followers a stronger will to keep 
demonstrating. It is estimated that approximately two million Koreans 
participated in more than 1,500 demonstrations for independence. 
Several thousand were massacred, wounded and arrested by the Japanese 
police force and army in what is known as the Bloody History of the 
Korean Independence Movement. These acts became the catalyst for the 
Korean Independence Movement that would help unify the Korean people in 
their quest for independence in 1945.
  Our alliance with the Republic of Korea has always been firm. Korea 
has remained one of the United States' closest and most steadfast 
allies and partners. Our shared belief in self-determination is pivotal 
to our joint success. I am proud to rise today to honor that history.
  I look forward to joining my constituents on February 26, 2019 for a 
ceremony recognizing the Centennial of the March 1st Movement. I hope 
my colleagues will recognize the importance of the Korean March 1st 
Movement as a reflection of our own values of freedom of assembly, 
freedom of speech, and freedom to self-govern.

commitment of Dillon Lesovsky, who received the Young Alumni Hall of 
Fame Award from the Victor Valley College Foundation on February 23, 
2019.
  Dillon is an entrepreneur at heart and has been since he was in his 
teens. In 2006, Dillon founded and operated a small business for six 
years which developed video content for the action sports industry as 
well as corporate projects throughout the U.S. He managed all aspects 
of production: developed budgets, drafted business proposals, 
negotiated with distributors, and managed contract staff. In 2013, I 
hired Dillon to serve as a Field Representative in my Apple Valley 
District Office, where he worked with federal agencies like Social 
Security and the Export-Import Bank to answer constituent questions, 
represented me at events in the High Desert community, and helped 
manage my social media accounts. In February of 2018, Dillon was 
recruited and hired by ComAv Asset Management to develop international 
business relationships within the commercial aircraft industry. Dillon 
has consistently exceeded his monthly sales quota in his region, and

consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 425, the Supporting Veterans 
in STEM Careers Act.
  I want to thank Mr. Dunn and Mr. Lamb for introducing this important 
legislation.
  Now, more than ever, U.S. global competitiveness depends on our 
ability to grow and sustain a STEM-capable workforce poised to meet the 
needs of the private sector. With an economy that is rapidly evolving 
and increasingly reliant on big data automation and advanced 
technologies, the workforce is struggling to keep up.
  Although STEM careers offer good pay and job security, companies 
across all sectors report having difficulty recruiting workers with the 
skills that they need.
  The good news is veterans and transitioning servicemembers represent 
a group of highly trained individuals with STEM knowledge base and 
skill sets employers need. The question is how to get more veterans to 
produce STEM degrees and join the STEM workforce.
  H.R. 425 addresses this question by supporting research to identify 
and lower barriers for veterans transitioning from military to civilian 
work environments. The bill directs the National Science Foundation to 
develop a comprehensive plan for outreach to veterans with the goal of 
increasing veteran participation in the agency STEM education and 
research programs.
  It also requires NSF, in its biennial Science and Engineering 
Indicators report, to publish available data on veterans in STEM 
studies and careers.
  Further, the bill adds veterans as a target demographic for outreach 
under several existing NSF programs, including the Robert Noyce Teacher 
Scholarship Program.
  Finally, H.R. 425 creates an interagency committee on veterans in 
STEM and directs the creation of a strategic plan for transitioning and 
training veterans and military spouses into STEM careers.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 425 will help us cement our global leadership by 
ensuring more veterans with the STEM skills we need are able to 
translate their talent into STEM careers. I strongly urge my colleagues 
to support this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",L000563,2019-02-25

  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Neal Dunn and Congressman Conor Lamb 
for their work to support our Nation's veterans.
  H.R. 425 will help veterans put their training and experience in 
military service to new and important uses and help America stay 
competitive in research and innovation on a global scale.
  In the last decade alone, jobs requiring some level of STEM expertise 
have grown by more than 30 percent, including jobs that do not require 
a bachelor's degree.
  Nearly 7 million jobs are unfulfilled in the United States due to a 
shortage of skilled workers, many in STEM and related fields.
  In my State of Oklahoma, our universities estimate we have 2,000 open 
engineering jobs. At the same time, veterans and transitioning 
servicemembers represent a valuable, skilled talent pool from which to 
meet this critical need.
  H.R. 425 will improve outreach to veterans through the National 
Science Foundation's programs to support and train STEM workers. We can 
serve our veterans and help them translate their experience into 
meaningful STEM work.

  First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida, Dr. Dunn, 
for his leadership in helping connect veterans to these good jobs.
  Veterans are working today. Most Americans are working today. The 
unemployment rate is low. And yet everywhere I go, I meet 
businesspeople who tell me that they can't find the right workers for 
the right jobs at the right time. If we could fix this, we would stop 
being held back by the shortage of workforce that we face, and, most 
importantly, our families would not be held back by lower paychecks.
  But these new jobs in cybersecurity, in medical technology, in 
advanced manufacturing, they are hard jobs and they require training.


  We need to make the training available to people where they live at a 
cost that they can actually afford. We have no time to waste.
  Our businesses are competing on a global stage against countries that 
will use the full machinery of their governments to make sure their 
workforces are ready. We need to meet their efforts with an even 
greater one.
  Luckily, we already have a workforce that will go anywhere and do 
anything. When it comes to hard work, these folks are fearless. That is 
the veteran population here in the United States.
  Marine officers are trained that if we are given an order to move 
that mountain over there, no sooner is the order completed than we are 
leading 100 marines down the road with shovels.
  I still have great faith in the ability of 100 marines with shovels, 
but what we really need today are hundreds of thousands of veterans who 
can 3D print those shovels, put them in the hands of robots, program 
them to go down the road, and defend the entire network from foreign 
intrusion.
  These are the jobs of today and tomorrow. These are the jobs that 
will support our families. Most importantly, these are the jobs that 
will grow the new middle class.
  We want to make sure veterans get these jobs. To do that, we are 
going to use this bill to turn to the National Science Foundation. The 
National Science Foundation was born in the aftermath of World War II 
to make sure that we led the world in science and math, and the most 
important advancements. We knew that if we did that, we could make our 
country safe, healthy, and strong.
  If we are going to continue that mission in the new generation, we 
will need veterans to lead the way.
  We do have a global competition on our hands, Mr. Speaker, and I know 
we can win it if we have the veterans with us. This bill will help 
them, and I urge all my colleagues to come together to pass it.",L000588,2019-02-25

Lucas, for yielding to me.


  H.R. 425, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, is about 
helping expand veterans' job and education opportunities in the 
sciences. The bill directs the National Science Foundation to develop a 
veterans outreach plan and publish data on veterans' participation in 
mathematics, science, and technology in its annual ``Science and 
Engineering Indicators'' report.
  The bill also updates the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship 
Program, its fellowship programs, and the cyber grant programs to 
include outreach to veterans.
  Additionally, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy 
is tasked with overseeing an interagency working group to examine how 
to increase veteran participation in the STEM career fields, including 
addressing any barriers for both servicemembers and their spouses.
  In the next 5 years, between 1 million and 1.5 million members of the 
Armed Forces will separate from the military, according to the 
Department of Defense. Many of these veterans will be seeking new 
careers, and by a great margin, veterans cite finding employment as 
their number-one need when separating from Active-Duty service.
  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations in STEM 
fields are projected to grow to more than 9 million jobs by 2022. 
Research shows that many military veterans already have skills and 
training that align with STEM careers, particularly in the area of 
information technology.
  However, it also shows that veterans face many barriers as they 
reenter the workforce, including a lack of formal certified STEM 
education, career guidance, and the difficult task of transferring 
military credits to civilian college credits.
  Our Nation's veterans deserve every opportunity to transition to a 
rewarding and successful civilian life. This bill will help all 
servicemembers continue to serve our Nation in new ways by fulfilling 
21st century jobs and keeping America on the cutting edge of 
innovation.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamb, a fellow member of the 
Science, Space, and Technology Committee and a Marine Corps veteran, 
for cosponsoring this bipartisan legislation. And I salute my fellow 
veterans on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee who joined me 
in introducing this bill.
  Last year, the House passed this legislation by an overwhelming 
margin, but we did not make it across the finish line in the Senate. 
This year, we have a bipartisan companion bill in the Senate, 
introduced by my home State Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Amy 
Klobuchar.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe that now is the time to get this done to help 
our Nation's veterans. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and the 
Senate to act on it and send H.R. 425 to the President's desk.",D000628,2019-02-25

the skills, the determination, and the know-how to thrive in high-
paying, secure STEM careers. H.R. 425 directs the National Science 
Foundation and the Office of Science and Technology Policy to leverage 
existing data and programs to better support veterans in their 
transition to the STEM workforce. We need all hands on deck if we are 
to maintain our standing as the global leader in innovation. H.R. 425

life of Dr. Mary Lacey, a pillar of our community who passed away this 
month at the age of 80.
   Dr. Lacey made an indelible mark on our communities by tirelessly 
serving those at the margins. Across Lake County, children in need, the 
homeless, and inmates and their families directly benefited from her 
generosity and boundless energy.
   Dr. Lacey broke multiple barriers throughout her life. She was born 
to humble beginnings, as one of ten children in rural Mississippi. At 
age 21 she moved to Florida to further her education, where she met her 
late husband William, and eventually settled in his hometown of 
Waukegan. She found work as a contractor at Naval Station Great Lakes 
as well as handmaking elegant hats.
   Never one to rest, she continued to study and was ordained a pastor, 
became a foster parent, and earned a certificate in social work.
   In Waukegan, her memory lives on as the namesake of Mary's Mission, 
a homeless shelter she founded that has provided shelter to hundreds of 
individuals in times of need, and has helped them develop the job 
training and skills they need to get back on their feet and live 
independently.
   Dr. Lacey was also a fierce advocate for children, bringing joy to 
young residents during the holidays. She teamed up with the Waukegan 
police department to start a toy giveaway program for children who 
might not receive a gift during the holidays. I had the privilege to 
join several of her annual Christmas parades from Mary's Mission to the 
Lake County jail, where she handed out turkeys and toys.
   Her perseverance in helping vulnerable people, touched and improved 
the lives of countless Illinoisans. Dr. Lacey truly lived her faith 
every day, and she will be sorely missed. I extend my heartfelt 
condolences to her many family and friends who are mourning her 
passing.

  Mr. Speaker, I thank House leadership for bringing H.R. 1235, the 
MSPB Temporary Term Extension Act, so quickly to the floor at the 
request of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.
  Chairman Cummings and I introduced this bill to prevent a potential 
crisis at the Merit Systems Protection Board, a vacant Board without 
any members. Acting Chairman Mark Robbins is and has been the sole 
member on the Board since January 2017. His holdover term expires at 
the end of this month, the 28th of February, and it cannot be extended 
without legislation. We planned to address this issue through regular 
order, but circumstances arose that prevented us from doing so.
  The subcommittee I am going to chair originally scheduled a hearing 
to examine the problem on February 14, but the hearing was postponed to 
the end of this month to allow all Members to attend the funerals of 
our colleagues John Dingell and Walter Jones.
  We hoped that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee would take action to address the problem during its business 
meeting on February 20. Although the Senate committee was able to 
approve two nominees for the Board, Chairman Johnson indicated he would 
withhold those nominations from the Senate floor pending the naming of 
a third nominee by the White House.
  The Senate committee was also reportedly working on language to 
extend Mr. Robbins' holdover term for another year, but no legislation 
was considered at the markup, thus our action today.
  Given these events, it appears less and less likely that the Senate 
will be able to confirm new Board members before time runs out this 
Thursday. That is why the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Chairman 
Cummings and I, introduced this stopgap measure, H.R. 1235, to ensure 
some work by the MSPB will continue. The legislation will provide a 
one-time, 1-year extension for Mr. Robbins' term to give the Senate 
more time to confirm the additional Board members.
  This version of the bill before us eliminates the provision 
prohibiting dual appointments because Mr. Robbins assured us he would 
continue to recuse himself from working on matters related to OPM and 
that he would recuse himself from OPM matters that related to votes he 
had taken at MSPB if this bill is enacted.
  This amendment is in response to many of the concerns raised by our 
Republican friends.
  We urgently need to pass this bill because we need to ensure that 
MSPB can continue its operations. If Mr. Robbins' term expires without 
new members confirmed, it will be the first time in the agency's 
history that the Board has no members at all. We will be entering 
uncharted new territory, and not good territory.
  If there is no principal officer to lead the agency, not only is it 
unclear


which agency functions may continue and which ones must be suspended, 
but, also, whether the entire agency must shut down completely. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to risk that shutdown.
  There is a lot at stake here. MSPB protects whistleblowers from 
retaliation, veterans from job discrimination, and Federal employees 
from prohibited personnel practices. The agency ensures that the 
Federal civil service is nonpartisan and complies with the merit system 
principles.
  Since 2017, MSPB has been operating under certain constraints without 
a quorum on the Board. This has prevented the Board from hearing final 
appeals of agency adverse actions.
  The absence of a quorum has also prevented the Board from issuing 
special studies of the civil service and reviews of OPM rules and 
regulations, as is required. This has resulted in a backlog, Mr. 
Speaker, of 2,000 final appeals which will take more than 3 years to 
process and eight Merit Systems studies pending issuance by the Board.
  The current situation is certainly less than ideal, but let's not 
make it worse by doing nothing and creating a complete vacancy on the 
Board.
  This would cause decisions made by Mr. Robbins, by the way, to be 
voided, exacerbating the backlog, and any new Board members who are 
finally confirmed would have to start again from square one.
  We should not and cannot allow that to happen. Addressing the problem 
should be a bipartisan concern, and I believe it is. We cannot let 
politics prevent MSPB from doing its job.
  The bill in front of us is supported by the American Federation of 
Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union, the 
National Federation of Federal Employees, the Government Accountability 
Project, Public Citizen, Project on Government Oversight, the Make It 
Safe Coalition, the Senior Executives Association, and the National 
Taxpayers Union.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from those 
organizations and a coalition of other stakeholders.
         American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,
                                Washington, DC, February 22, 2019.
     Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,
     Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
         Washington, DC.
     Hon. Jim Jordan,
     Ranking Member, House Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Cummings and Ranking Member Jordan: On behalf 
     of the American Federation of Government Employees. AFL-CIO 
     (AFGE), I am writing to urge support for the ``Merit Systems 
     Protection Board (MSPB) Temporary Term Extension Act,'' 
     introduced by Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD). This 
     legislation would allow the term of the current and only MSPB 
     member to be extended and avoid having a vacant Board.
       An employee may appeal an adverse action to the MSPB, a 
     third-party agency that hears and adjudicates civil service 
     appeals. MSPB administrative judges (AJs) hear the matter in 
     an adversarial setting and decide the case in accordance with 
     established legal precedents. If dissatisfied with the AJ's 
     decision. either the agency or the employee may appeal the 
     decision to the full three Member MSPB. Currently, the Board 
     does not have a quorum. Mark Robbins is the only member on 
     the Board and his term expires on February 28, 2019. Robbins' 
     original term ended in March 2018, and he is currently 
     serving under a maximum one-year statutory extension.
       When Robbins' term expires, the Board will have no 
     Presidentially-appointed members. The ``MSPB Temporary Term 
     Extension Act.'' would allow for Robbins to extend his term 
     for one additional year and avoid having an MSPB with no 
     members. AFGE believes that the MSPB serves an important role 
     in upholding the Merit Systems Principles and the rights of 
     federal employees. Therefore, AFGE strongly urges you to 
     support the ``MSPB Temporary Term Extension Act.'' to allow a 
     temporary carryover of the current and only member of the 
     MSPB. Thank you.
           Sincerely,
                                                J. David Cox, Sr.,
                                               National President.
         NTEU, The National Treasury Employees Union,
                                Washington, DC, February 19, 2019.
     Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,
     Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Reform,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Cummings: On behalf of the National Treasury 
     Employees Union (NTEU), representing over 150,000 federal 
     employees in 33 agencies, 1 write to applaud your efforts to 
     support the important work performed by the Merit Systems 
     Protection Board (MSBP or Board) and ensure that it can 
     continue. We believe that your bill, the MSPB Temporary Term 
     Extension Act, is the appropriate response to address the 
     impending loss of leadership at the Board.
       As you know, Mark Robbins is the Acting Chairman and the 
     only Member left on the Board. His original term expired last 
     year and his holdover year will expire on February 28, 2019. 
     Given the uncertainty regarding the operations of the Board 
     once Mr. Robbins' term ends, we appreciate that your bill 
     would temporarily allow Mr. Robbins to remain on the Board 
     for a short period of time while the President's nominees for 
     the MSPB undergo Senate consideration. We also appreciate 
     that the bill stipulates that the individual who would be 
     allowed to extend their term would be unable to hold another 
     position in the government at the same time.
       NTEU fully supports your carefully crafted temporary 
     extension bill and we appreciate your efforts to safeguard 
     the employee protections envisioned in the Civil Service

1554,MSPB TEMPORARY TERM EXTENSION ACT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2062,6,Mr. HICE of Georgia,"  Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 1235, the MSPB Temporary 
Term Extension Act.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that I personally 
am committed to ensuring the successful operation of the Merit Systems 
Protection Board, also known as MSPB. In fact, last Congress, I 
introduced H.R. 6391, the MSPB Reauthorization Act of 2018. My bill 
would have reauthorized the Board and made other vital reforms. The 
Committee on Oversight


and Government Reform reported the bill favorably, but without a single 
vote from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
  We all know an effective and functional MSPB is important to the 
health of our Federal workforce. MSPB's primary responsibility is to 
adjudicate appeals of Federal personnel actions. MSPB also plays a 
vital role in Federal whistleblower protections.
  To be effective and issue decisions, MSPB needs at least a two-member 
quorum, but the Board has not had a quorum for over 2 years. In January 
2017, Mark Robbins, as my friend mentioned, become the sole remaining 
member of MSPB.
  Last year, Mr. Robbins' 7-year term came to an end, and he was 
granted a 1-year extension as authorized by law, but that extension 
ends this week. Starting Friday, the MSPB will be without a single 
Board member.
  My colleagues claim this bill is an emergency measure to prevent the 
MSPB from extending this crisis of leadership, but I disagree. The real 
problem is the lack of a quorum.
  Without a quorum for the last 2 years, a backlog of undecided appeals 
has grown to over 1,700 cases. Mr. Robbins cannot fix that problem on 
his own. His continued tenure will not resolve those cases.
  In December, the President selected Mr. Robbins to serve as the 
general counsel at the Office of Personnel Management, so for the last 
10 weeks, he has served in both capacities at OPM and MSPB. Mr. Robbins 
is planning to serve at OPM in his full capacity beginning this Friday.
  Mr. Robbins has stayed at MSPB as long as he has out of a sense of 
duty to MSPB and its mission. I trust that my colleagues do not intend 
to use this bill to coerce Mr. Robbins to stay any longer than he wants 
to.


  I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding Mr. Robbins for his 
dedication to MSPB, the Federal workforce, the President, and our 
country. I also urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the 
Senate's confirmation of President Trump's nominees.
  We owe it to our Federal workers to give MSPB a quorum so the board 
can do the important job that Congress gave it to do.
  In the future, I certainly hope we can work together to provide 
certainty to Federal workers and whistleblowers by making MSPB 
operational once again.
  Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.",H001071,2019-02-25
1555,MSPB TEMPORARY TERM EXTENSION ACT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2062,7,Mr. CONNOLLY,"  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Briefly, in responding to my friend: I agree with him. I think we 
need a full board. Our problem is the Senate. They didn't get around to 
acting in a timely fashion, and so we are faced with this.
  I think it is also important to note that, although a quorum is 
necessary for most work of MSPB, it isn't necessary for all of it.
  So Mr. Robbins, in a caretaker, interim position, can still do some 
of the work of the board, including issuing stays, reviewing some of 
the work, and helping to avoid adding to the backlog.
  He can't substitute himself fully, obviously, for a quorum in the 
board. My colleague is quite right about that.
  What we are trying to do here is not to compel him or coerce him to 
stay against his wishes; it is to try to buy some time and have the 
board at least do some of its basic functions so that we don't come to 
a complete standstill. That would not be necessary, frankly, had the 
Senate acted.
  I think my friend is right in suggesting that is the ultimate answer, 
and I would join him in calling on the Senate to act as swiftly as 
possible. But I think we have no choice but to act on this bill now.
  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.",C001078,2019-02-25

1557,REMEMBERING THE 27TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KHOJALY MASSACRE,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE200-4,0,Mr. HASTINGS,"  Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 27th 
anniversary of the Khojaly Massacre, which took place on February 26, 
1992, and remember the 613 men, women, and children who were brutalized 
during this despicable act of violence.
  Khojaly, a town in the Republic of Azerbaijan, was home to an 
unprecedented act of brutality that desecrated the norms and principles 
of international law, human rights, and freedoms. Armenian forces, with 
the support of the 366th motorized rifle regiment of the Russian army, 
stormed the besieged town of Khojaly engaging in acts so violent that 
their effects are still felt in the community, indeed the entire 
country, to this day.
  Madam Speaker, although a ceasefire was achieved in 1994, more than 
20 percent of Azerbaijani territory including Nagorno Karabakh remain 
occupied and more than 1 million Azerbaijanis remain refugees and 
internally displaced persons. Over the past 20 years, Azerbaijan has 
spent over 6 billion dollars to ensure the social welfare of the 
internally displaced. Notably, while providing this crucial and costly 
support, Azerbaijan has still taken significant and impressive strides 
to improve economic development in their region.
  Indeed the Government of Azerbaijan has not only contributed to 
regional stability, but has continued to be a reliable ally for the 
United States in combating terrorism around the world. In the days 
after September 11, 2001, Azerbaijan quickly conveyed its solidarity 
with the American people and provided crucial assistance to our fight 
against terrorism by granting unconditional clearance to our military 
to use Azerbaijan's airspace as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in 
Afghanistan. This is in addition to the naval and ground routes the 
country provides for the international coalition's supplies that are to 
be delivered to forces in Afghanistan.
  Madam Speaker, marking the anniversary of a tragedy is always a 
solemn occasion. However, as a member of the Azerbaijan Caucus, I 
believe it is important to recognize and remember those whose lives 
were lost. I ask my colleagues to join me in offering condolences to 
the people of Azerbaijan.

1558,ROGER WAGNER RECEIVES THE PRESIDENTS' AWARD,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE204-3,0,Mr. COOK,"  Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and 
commitment of Roger Wagner, who received the Presidents' Award from the 
Victor Valley College Foundation on February 23, 2019.
  Roger served as the Victor Valley College Superintendent and 
President for over four years and officially retired at the end of 
2018. Prior to his retirement, he was instrumental in Victor Valley 
College receiving full accreditation from the Accrediting Commission 
for Community and Junior Colleges. Roger has a passion for education 
and understands the importance of the college providing local students 
with an affordable and high quality education. Roger was responsible 
for a number of successes for the college, including hosting the 2017 
Youth Poverty Symposium, opening the Automotive and Welding Facility, 
and developing new programs including Industrial Maintenance and 
Manufacturing programs. He is married to his wife Stacy and together 
they have two children.
  Before my career in politics, I had the privilege of working with 
Roger at Copper Mountain College in the Morongo Basin. I can say from 
experience that Roger is an incredibly intelligent and hard-working 
individual with a true passion for education, and I can guarantee that 
he will be sorely missed at Victor Valley College. I congratulate Roger 
on receiving this award, and wish him all the best as he heads into 
retirement.

1559,JUVENILE JUSTICE,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgH2088-5,0,Ms. JACKSON LEE,"  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, just recently, I was very proud and 
pleased that this body passed my legislation, the Juvenile Block Grant 
Anti-Bullying and Intervention Act, dealing with the prevention of 
bullying but, more importantly, dealing with the opportunities for 
communities across America to begin to think more creatively about how 
you deal with juvenile justice, how you deal with young people of 
juvenile age who have gone awry of school laws, regular actions of 
criminal activities. How do you deal with these young people?
  It is clear that the juvenile justice system needs to be reformed. As 
a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, it is my commitment to 
listen to people from across the Nation.
  Many people don't realize that once you are committed to a juvenile 
detention center or facility or jail, under juvenile laws in most 
States, and many of them receiving Federal dollars, you will find that 
there is no definitive sentence. They are sentenced and could be there 
from age 14 to 21.
  It may be that their parents do not have resources to get them out; 
it may be that they do not have an alternative place to go; and it may 
be that they have no representation. That is not the way to treat young 
people.
  So we will be looking for legislation to incentivize our States to 
change the juvenile justice and the criminal justice system, and we 
look forward to working with all of our colleagues.

1560,DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1410-3,0,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before Congress went out of session 2 
weeks ago, President Trump announced that he was declaring a national 
emergency to redirect funds to the construction of a border wall. It 
was a lawless act, a gross abuse of power, and an attempt by the 
President to distract from the fact that he broke his core promise to 
have Mexico pay for the wall.
  Let me give a few reasons why the President's emergency is so wrong.
  First, there is no evidence of an emergency at the border. Illegal 
border crossings have been declining for 20 years. Just this morning, a 
group of 58 former senior national security figures, including Chuck 
Hagel and Madeleine Albright, released a statement saying: ``Under no 
plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency 
today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for 
other purposes to build a wall at the southern border.''
  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement be printed in the 
Record.",S000148,2019-02-25
1561,DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1410-3,1,Mr. SCHUMER,"  Mr. SCHUMER. Even the President himself, who is now declaring an 
emergency, halfway through his meandering speech proclaiming the 
emergency, said: ``I didn't need to do this . . . but I'd rather do it 
[build the wall] much faster.''
  If there was ever a statement that says this is not an emergency, 
that is it. He said he didn't need to do this. So, my colleagues, my 
dear colleagues, if we are going to let the President, any President, 
on a whim, declare emergencies just because he or she can't get their 
way in the Congress, we have fundamentally changed the building blocks, 
these strong, proud building blocks that the Founding Fathers put into 
place.
  Second, the President's emergency declaration could cannibalize 
funding from worthy projects all over the country. We don't even know 
yet which projects he is planning to take the funds from. I ask my 
colleagues to think about that--what important initiatives in your 
State are on the Trump chopping block? What military project will the 
President cancel to fund the border wall Congress rejected?
  Third, and I made this point a little bit at the beginning, but it 
bears repeating. Far and away most importantly, the President's 
emergency declaration is a fundamental distortion of our constitutional 
order. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, not the 
President, and congressional intent on the border wall is clear. The 
President's wall has been before Congress several times, and not once 
has it garnered enough votes to merit consideration. In some cases it 
was with Republican votes. The President said that it was just the 
Democrats who blocked it. That is not true. There were Republican votes 
when the wall was on the floor for voting as well.
  As the great New Yorker, Justice Jackson from Jamestown, NY, 
observed, the President's legal authority in the realm of emergencies 
is at its very weakest when it goes against the expressed will of 
Congress. In case the will of Congress was not already clear, soon it 
will be made so. The obvious remedy for President Trump's outrageous 
and lawless declaration is for Congress to vote to terminate the state 
of emergency. The House will vote on such a resolution tomorrow, and 
the Senate will soon follow suit.
  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle fashion themselves 
supporters of the military, defenders of property rights, and stewards 
of the Constitution, as do Democrats. This vote on the resolution to 
terminate the state of emergency will test our fidelity to those 
principles.
  Congress should come together to reject in a bipartisan fashion--we 
have come together before in bipartisan ways. If ever there were one 
moment that cries out for bipartisan rejection of an overreach of 
power, this is it. We should reject this naked power grab, this 
defacement of our constitutional balance of powers, for what seem to be 
largely political purposes.

1562,"CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JUDGE RUSSELL B. SUGARMON, JR.",CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE204-4,0,Mr. COHEN,"  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of 
Russell B. Sugarmon--a great American jurist, Civil Rights leader, 
political pioneer and elder statesman from my hometown of Memphis, 
Tennessee. Judge Sugarmon died Monday after a long illness at the age 
of 89 but will be remembered forever as a crusading legal scholar who 
worked to end segregation in the Memphis public schools and for being a 
political genius who helped behind the scenes to elect the African 
American and progressive candidates who reshaped Memphis. In 1959, 
Sugarmon was one of the first African Americans to run for citywide 
office when he sought to be commissioner for public works. In 1966, he 
was elected to become Tennessee's second African American state 
representative since Reconstruction and was later elected a General 
Sessions Court judge after serving as a partner in Memphis' and 
Tennessee's first integrated law firm--Ratner, Sugarmon, Lucas and 
Willis. Other legendary attorneys such as Bill Caldwell, Irvin Salky, 
Troy Henderson, Walter Bailey, Jr., Russell X. Thompson and Tom Arnold 
hung their hats and licenses there. From 1976 to 1987, Judge Sugarmon 
was a referee in the Memphis Juvenile Court system, stepping down in 
May 1987 when he was appointed a General Sessions Court Judge. He was 
elected to the bench in 1988 and was reelected in 1990 and 1998. 
Russell Bertram Sugarmon, Jr. graduated from the city's Booker T. 
Washington High School in 1946 at the age of 15. Sugarmon spent a year 
at Morehouse College--in the class a year behind Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr.--and transferred to Rutgers University, where he received his 
undergraduate degree in Political Science in 1950. He received his J.D. 
from Harvard University in 1953 and spent the following two years in 
the U.S. Army based mainly in Japan. After returning to the United 
States, he did further graduate studies at Boston University, then came 
back to Memphis in 1956 to establish a private legal practice. Judge 
Sugarmon worked tirelessly even when victory wasn't in the cards and 
kept the faith, knowing that it would come in time. He was one of the 
most learned strategists on politics and history in our community, 
avoiding the limelight but holding sway as the influential wise man 
behind the scenes in collaboration with a biracial and tolerant group 
of progressive leaders. Judge Sugarmon was a mentor, supporter and 
friend of mine my entire life and I am eternally grateful to have been 
so fortunate to have shared time with this remarkably knowledgeable, 
judicious and beloved man. Last year, Congress


passed and the President signed into law my bill designating the post 
office at 1325 Autumn Avenue as the Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office. I 
had hoped Judge Sugarmon would be on hand for its dedication later this 
year but its existence will stand as a lasting physical monument to his 
stature in our city, in our state and in our nation. No one is more 
deserving. Supporting Russell Sugarmon's great work and providing 
encouragement and strength was the Sugarmon family. Russell was a 
beloved husband and father of six children, sadly preceded in death by 
his dear daughter Tina Spence. I extend my sincere condolences to his 
devoted wife and companion, Gina; his children Judge Tarik Sugarmon, 
Elena Williams, Erika Sugarmon, Monique Sugarmon and Carol Spence; his 
extended family and his many friends.

1564,HONORING STEPHEN PHILIP SPERNAK,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE200-3,0,Mr. CORREA,"  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the distinguished 
public service career of Mr. Stephen Philip Spernak. Mr. Spernak has 
dedicated over 20 years to serving and benefitting our community in 
Orange County. In 1982 Mr. Spernak began working for the Cypress Police 
Department, and here is where his strong leadership and hard work began 
to take notice.
  Mr. Spernak served 14 years with the Cypress Police Department, 
during this time he was named Officer of the Year in 1988 and received 
the Medal of Valor in 1993 for rescuing an infant from a burning 
structure. Officer Spernak was nationally recognized by Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving (MADD) in 1990 for creating a drunk driving education 
program for teens, which is still used today. MADD recognized Mr. 
Spernak as Officer of the Year in 1989 and he has since served as a 
spokesman and lecturer for MADD for 24 years. He also created and 
launched a notable public affairs program related to crime prevention, 
drunk driving, traffic safety, and neighborhood watch through public 
appearances and cable TV. Mr. Spernak has also served as an Orange 
County Sheriff Reserve Deputy.
  Outside of law enforcement, Mr. Spernak acted as Executive Assistant 
and Policy Advisor to Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer during his 
two terms in office. In these roles he aided the Local Agency Formation 
Commission (LAFCO) in their efforts to incorporate Rancho Santiago 
Margarita into cityhood. His successful role led him to serve as Deputy 
City Manager of this new city in 2000.
  While serving the Orange County Supervisors, he played a lead role on 
Supervisor Spitzer's staff, serving as his Southern California Liaison. 
In this role he collaborated with anti-airport committees and 
successfully defeated a plan to build an international airport at El 
Toro Marine Air Corps Station.

1567,BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1410,0,Mr. McCONNELL,"  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this 
week the Senate will resume our work in the personnel business by 
considering yet another of President Trump's qualified judicial 
nominees.
  Eric Miller has been chosen to sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals, and one look at his legal career to this point says he is well 
prepared to do so.
  Mr. Miller is a graduate of Harvard and the University of Chicago, 
where he served on the Law Review editorial staff. He has held 
prominent clerkships on both the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and the 
U.S. Supreme Court. His record of public service at the Justice 
Department and in private practice reflects a legal mind of the highest 
caliber.
  I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance the 
first circuit court nominee of this new Congress. That will be 31 since 
President Trump took office. But first, in just a few hours, the Senate 
will vote on advancing a straightforward piece of legislation to 
protect newborn babies. This legislation is simple. It would simply 
require that medical professionals give the same standard of care and 
medical treatment to newborn babies who have survived an attempted 
abortion as any other newborn baby would receive in any other 
circumstance. It isn't about new restrictions on abortion. It isn't 
about changing the options available to women. It is just about 
recognizing that a newborn baby is a newborn baby, period.
  This bill would make clear that in the year 2019, in the United 
States of America, medical professionals on hand when a baby is born 
alive need to maintain their basic ethical and professional 
responsibilities to that newborn. It would make sure our laws reflect 
the fact that the human rights of newborn boys and girls are innate; 
they don't come and go based on the circumstances of birth. Whatever 
the circumstances, if that medical professional comes face-to-face with 
a baby who has been born alive, they are looking at a human being with 
human rights, period.
  To be frank, it makes me uneasy that such a basic statement seems to 
be generating actual disagreement. Can the extreme, far-left politics 
surrounding abortion really have come this far? Are we really supposed 
to think that it is normal that there are now two sides debating 
whether newborn, living babies deserve medical attention?
  We already know that many of our Democratic colleagues want the 
United States to remain one of seven nations in the world that permit 
elective abortions after 20 weeks--seven countries, including North 
Korea, China, and the United States of America. But now it seems the 
far left wants to push the envelope even further. Apart from the entire 
abortion debate, they now seem to be suggesting that newborn babies' 
right to life may be contingent--contingent--on the circumstances 
surrounding their birth. Well, evidently, the far left is no longer 
convinced that all babies are created equal, but the rest of us are 
still pretty fond of that principle.
  My colleagues across the aisle need to decide where they will take 
their cues on these moral questions. On the one hand, there are a few 
extreme voices who have decided that some newborn lives are more 
disposable than others. On the other side is the entire rest of the 
country.
  I would urge my colleagues: Let's listen to the voices of the 
American people. Let's reaffirm that when we say every life is created 
equal, we actually mean it. Let's vote to advance the Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act later today.

Children's Dental Health Month. This is such an important cause and we 
are glad to bring awareness to promote good oral health for children. 
Tooth decay is the number one chronic infectious disease among children 
in the U.S. The impact of not treating decay can lead to other bad 
outcomes beyond just oral health. The Congressional Oral Health Caucus 
is pleased to support National Children's Dental Health Month and any 
activities taking place throughout the month of February.
  Give Kids A Smile, which is sponsored by the ADA Foundation, is at 
the center of National Children's Dental Health Month. Give Kids a 
Smile day is such an important event for all children and dentists 
throughout the country. Because of this program, the ADA Foundation is 
able to provide assistance to more than 6,000 dentists and 57,000 
dental team members, and other volunteers who proudly give their time 
and effort to make a difference in the health of children. Since this 
program has started, volunteers have graciously provided services to 
over 5.5 million kids across the country, and to all 50 states as well. 
They have truly made a huge impact in their communities and improved 
the oral health of so many children.
  Throughout National Children's Dental Health Month, dentists and 
dental team members across the country will be providing oral health 
services for children in need, and this will continue throughout the 
year. These services will include oral health education, screenings, 
preventive care and restorative services. Some will provide this in 
their own dental practice, others will go right into schools and the 
community to reach the kids that need it most. There are also many 
major events at dental hygiene schools where hundreds of kid may 
receive oral health services.
  Continued public awareness on this issue is so critical. On behalf of 
the Congressional Oral Health Caucus, I would once again like to state 
our full endorsement for the month, and push for continued care for 
good oral health of children.

  Throughout her tenure, she served with distinction, working hard to 
ensure that the Office of the Clerk always acted in a nonpartisan, 
bipartisan way, which brought credit on this House and great service to 
every Member.
  Thank you for that, Karen.
  Many of us serving in the House have known her even longer, going 
back to her service on the staff of former Speaker Hastert and former 
Republican Leader Bob Michel.
  I might say of the latter, Bob Michel was one of the finest human 
beings I have ever known and one of the best Members that I have ever 
served with. Karen was proud to serve with him, and he, I know, was so 
fond of Karen and her service to him and to the House.
  Now, I may not be totally objective. Karen is a native Marylander. 
Karen is also a graduate of the University of Maryland, so Karen and I 
share a lot in common. We live in Maryland; we graduated from Maryland; 
and we love this House.
  I offer her the thanks of the House, its Members, and our staff, as 
she steps down from this position. I am not sure where Karen is going, 
but I guarantee you, our loss will be somebody else's gain, because she 
has the kind of talent, commitment, energy, and faithfulness that will 
make a real difference wherever she goes.
  I also congratulate Cheryl Johnson for becoming the 36th Clerk of the 
House of Representatives.
  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, Cheryl returns to the House where 
she served for 20 years with the Committee on Education and Labor, as 
well as the Committee on House Administration.
  She will bring an extraordinary amount of experience to her job as 
the Clerk of the House. I know she will do an outstanding job, and I 
welcome her back to this House, which she has served so ably before.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.",H000874,2019-02-25

Terrapin from Maryland, for yielding.
  I want to say, first, we are going to miss Karen Haas. Karen Haas 
served this body so well, as the majority leader talked about, and in 
such a fair way, treating all Members with the dignity and respect that 
they all deserve as we all carry out the work of the people's House.
  When you think about the different roles that she has played, serving 
this Chamber, this body, for decades in a number of different roles, 
but, of course, most notably to all of us, twice as Clerk of the House. 
She was actually here once before, left, realized just how much fun it 
is to be in this House and work for this great body, and came back.
  We thank you for coming back again and for your great service during 
these times.
  So much work goes into the operations of the House. The things that 
we do on a daily basis, whether it is a Member filing a bill, when you 
go down to drop your bill in the hopper, it is Karen and the entire 
team that she has put together at the Office of the Clerk that receives 
the bills, that processes the bills.
  When we all vote for and sometimes against the Journal, it is the 
Clerk that puts together the Journal of the House to make sure that the 
things that we do are properly recorded throughout time for people to 
go review.
  It is an important job. But it is the work that she has done that we 
all see on a daily basis that we are going to miss.
  As Cheryl Johnson takes her place, best of luck to you as well. We 
wish you all the best, but we are going to miss Karen.


  We wish you the best in your next endeavor. You can come visit us 
from time to time.
  Karen, thank you so much for the work that you have done on behalf of 
not just us as Members of Congress, but on behalf of all the American 
people who count on this institution to function properly, for helping 
us make sure that it is done in a proper, efficient, fair, and 
impartial way. Best of luck to you, Karen.",S001176,2019-02-25

gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader.

to congratulate Karen Haas, who after five terms as Clerk of the House, 
is retiring.
  I would like to remind all Members in this body that fewer than 
11,000 people have ever had the privilege to serve in this House. It is 
even fewer for a Clerk.
  Karen was our 34th Clerk and only the second woman to hold that 
position. We thank you for that leadership. When we think about the 
role of the House Clerk, you think of roll calls and recorded votes. 
But the Office of the Clerk is really about continuity. Without the 
Clerk, Congress could not fulfill its obligation to the American people 
and move in a smooth manner, which many people don't see the challenge.
  Few individuals are more committed to preserving the continuity than 
Karen. She has done that as Clerk and as a trusted staff member and 
floor assistant. Always, she has been a friend and counselor to 
Members, regardless of what side of the aisle you sat on.
  Karen Haas also equipped and modernized this House for the 21st 
century. Oftentimes, you won't see that because it is behind the 
scenes, but it makes the legislative process more accessible to the 
people it serves.
  Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to Karen for her dedication, her team's 
professionalism, and her steady hand on the tiller. Her service reminds 
us of an important fact: The people's House is only as good as its 
people.
  You rose to the occasion. On behalf of a very grateful House, and a 
grateful Nation, we say thank you, Karen.

recognition and calling us together to salute two great women in this 
Chamber.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise for the great honor of swearing in Cheryl Lynn 
Johnson as the 36th Clerk of the House of Representatives. This is a 
very distinguished and prestigious role.
  Mr. McCarthy, I was pleased to appoint the first African American 
woman Clerk of the House, Lorraine Miller, when I was Speaker before, 
and now I am happy to be appointing the second.
  We are privileged to be joined by Cheryl's parents, the Reverend 
Charlie Davis and Cynthia Davis of New Orleans, who are with us in the 
Chamber. Thank you for being with us.
  We are also pleased to welcome Cheryl's husband, Clarence Ellison, 
and her son, Bradford, to this Chamber today as well. Welcome to you, 
and thank you.
  I join our colleagues, the distinguished Democratic leader, the 
Republican leader, and distinguished Republican whip in saluting House 
Clerk Karen Haas for her many years of distinguished service to this 
institution.
  Anyone who knows her is proud of her service. On behalf of the U.S. 
House of Representatives, I thank you, Karen, for the great integrity 
and dedication for which you have served the people's House. Thank you 
so much.
  She has been magnificent.
  Cheryl Johnson embodies public service and has dedicated her career 
to strengthening many of the most important institutions of our 
democracy, including our own.
  Indeed, today is a homecoming, as Leader Hoyer has mentioned, as 
Cheryl returns to the House of Representatives where she worked with 
distinction and honor for Chairman Lacy Clay, Sr.--I emphasize senior--
of the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Libraries 
and Memorials; and the House Committee on Post Offices and Civil 
Service Subcommittee on Investigations.
  Our country is stronger for her work on the then-Committee on 
Education and the Workforce to secure justice and progress for our 
children and advance fairness and respect for our workers.
  In the Congress, she earned the respect of all--Members and staff, 
Democrats and Republicans--for being a leader of compassion, courage, 
and commitment.
  Cheryl returns to the House after more than a decade at the 
Smithsonian Institution. Her great dedication to that American 
treasure--which is the largest museum in the world--has ensured that it 
will remain a source of creativity, innovation, and research for 
generations to come.
  Our Nation is particularly grateful for her extraordinary vision and 
persistence in helping transform the dream of the National Museum of 
African American History and Culture into a reality.
  Cheryl has made a difference empowering millions of Americans and 
visitors from abroad to explore and be inspired by the beauty and 
richness of American culture and history.
  Cheryl's strong leadership and deep love and respect for the 
institutions of our democracy will be vital in her role as House Clerk, 
strengthening and safeguarding the Congress in the tradition of Karen 
and the Congress, the first branch of government, Article I.
  I thank Cheryl for her commitment to our institution and to our 
democracy; and with great, again, recognition and appreciation to Karen 
Haas for her service.
  It is now my privilege to administer the oath of office to Cheryl 
Johnson.

1578,BENJAMIN B. TUCKER,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE206,0,Mr. SERRANO,"  Mr. SERRANO. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise 
today to honor First Deputy Commissioner Benjamin B. Tucker of the New 
York Police Department for his years of public service and tireless 
work to improve the lives of our community and our city. He is a great 
example of the countless contributions that African Americans make 
every day to the Bronx and our Nation.
  First Deputy Commissioner Tucker began his career with the New York 
City Police Department (NYPD) in 1969 as a Police Trainee. In this 
role, he conducted an innovative school-based drug prevention education 
program. He became a Police Officer in 1972 and was promoted to 
Sergeant in 1987. During his 22 years of service with the NYPD, Mr. 
Tucker performed patrol, school task force, anti-crime, and community 
affairs assignments. In addition, he served as a Police Academy 
instructor, legal advisor in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for 
Legal Matters; and as the Assistant Director of the Civilian Complaint 
Review Board.
  In 1995, President William Jefferson Clinton appointed Mr. Tucker as 
the Deputy Director for Operations in the Office of Community Oriented 
Policing Services at the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2009, Mr. 
Tucker was nominated by President Barack H. Obama, and confirmed by the 
United States Senate, as the Deputy Director for State, Local and 
Tribal Affairs within the White House Office of National Drug Control 
Policy.
  His unique experiences in law enforcement, public service, and 
academia led in 2014 to Mr. Tucker's appointment as Deputy Commissioner 
for Training during NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton's tenure. 
Proving to be a valued member of the executive staff, Mr. Tucker was 
promoted to First Deputy Commissioner and entrusted to direct design 
and implement a broad range of policy, programs, and training to 
strengthen community relations and improve the performance of the 
Department.
  First Deputy Commissioner Tucker holds a Bachelor of Science in 
Criminal Justice from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City 
University of New York, a Juris Doctor from Fordham University School 
of Law, and is a tenured professor at Pace University.
  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring First 
Deputy Commissioner Benjamin B. Tucker for his distinguished public 
service and extensive contributions in ensuring the safety and well-
being of the residents of New York City.

from New York--my friend from the gym and the minority leader--deliver 
some summaries of what he said was in the bill before us, and he 
implored this body and implored the people watching on C-SPAN to read 
the bill, stating they would find that all of these terrible things are 
in the bill.
  I see the minority leader has to leave the floor now, but, humbly, I 
would urge him to come back and show us where any of what he just said 
is in this bill. What he said wasn't true.
  I rise today for a simple purpose. I want to ask each and every one 
of our colleagues whether we are OK with infanticide. This language is 
blunt. I recognize that, and it is too blunt for many people in this 
body, but, frankly, that is what we are talking about here today.
  Infanticide is what the abortion survivors--Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act is actually about.
  Are we a country that protects babies who are alive, born outside the 
womb after having survived a botched abortion? That is what this is 
about.
  Are we a country that says it is OK to actively allow that baby to 
die, which is the current position of Federal law? That is the question 
before us, plain and simple.
  Here are the facts. We know that some babies, especially late in 
gestation, survive attempted abortions. We know, too, that some of 
these babies are left to die--left to die. No further protections exist 
today to shield them from this ugly fate, and only some States have 
protections on their books. We have seen in our national discourse over 
the last month and a half a few States moving in different ways to undo 
protections that some of these babies have had at the State level.
  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is trying to right 
this obvious wrong. The bill's terms are simple: A child born alive 
during a botched abortion would be given the same level of care that 
would be provided to any other baby born at that same gestational age. 
That is it.
  This bill isn't about abortion. I am pro-life--unapologetically pro-
life--but this bill is not about anything that limits abortion. This 
bill doesn't have anything to do with Roe v. Wade. This bill is about 
something else. What this bill does is try to secure basic rights, 
equal rights for babies who are born and are outside the womb. That is 
what we are talking about.
  Over the course of the next hour, as this is debated on the floor, 
people are going to say a whole bunch of other things. I would ask them 
to please bring the text of the bill to the floor when they do it and 
show us whether there is anything about limiting abortion in this bill.
  This bill is exclusively about protecting babies who have already 
been born and are outside of the womb. Every baby deserves a fighting 
chance, whether that 24-week old baby, fighting for air and fighting 
for life, having just taken her first breaths, is at an abortion clinic 
where she survived a botched abortion or she is in a delivery room at 
the local hospital. Both of those babies are equally deserving of care, 
protection, and humane treatment, and our laws should treat both of 
these human beings as babies because they are babies. They have been 
born, and they are outside of the womb.


  This really should not be controversial. In fact, my colleagues 
actually talk this way all of the time. This place feels like about 
one-third of the people here are currently running for President, so I 
would like to quote a few of them over the course of the last couple 
months.
  We ought to ``build a country where no one is forgotten, and no one 
is left behind.'' Amen to that. Amen to that.

  ``The people in our society who are most often targeted by predators 
are also often the voiceless and the vulnerable.''
  That is true.
  Another offered a promise to ``fight for other people's kids as hard 
as I fight for my own kids.''
  Last week, our colleague from Vermont announced his campaign by 
saying: ``The mark of a great Nation is . . . how it treats its most 
vulnerable people.'' Bernie Sanders was right.
  Now is the chance, in this body, to make good on that promise. Now is 
the chance to protect one of the most vulnerable populations on the 
land imaginable--tiny, defenseless, little babies, just having taken 
their first breath--or was that claptrap for the campaign trail or 
sound-bites? Or do people mean the stuff they say around here?
  Let's put it another way. Today's vote asks whether or not you want 
to take the side of people like Virginia's disgraced Governor Ralph 
Northam?
  Last month, before the news of his hideous yearbook broke, Governor 
Northam made clear that a baby born alive during an abortion could and 
maybe ought to be killed if that is what the parents and doctors 
decided they wanted to do after a debate. That was his position: You 
should make the baby ``comfortable,'' and then there could be a 
discussion about whether or not you throw that little baby into the 
trash can. That is what he actually talked about on the radio for a day 
and a half last month.
  Governor Northam is disgraceful for a whole host of reasons, but 
unlike some other people, he actually told the truth about what he 
wants. He wants a society where some people count more than others, and 
other people are worth less than others. He wants a society where some 
people can be pushed aside if they are inconvenient. In reality, that 
is what we are voting on today.
  Some of my colleagues want to write into our law a kind of permanent 
exception: ``Every human being should be protected from cruel and 
inhuman treatment--unless that human being came into the world through 
a botched abortion.'' Then, you can decide later if you want to kill 
them.
  Tonight, what we are going to vote on in the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act is a chance to see whether we are serious when 
people around here say they want to protect the innocent, speak up for 
the voiceless, and defend the defenseless. Tonight, we are going to 
have the opportunity to do exactly that. We can come to the aid of 
innocent, voiceless, defenseless little babies who have just taken 
their first breaths by protecting him and her from mistreatment and 
neglect.
  This should be, frankly, the easiest vote we ever cast in this body, 
but the prospect of what we are voting on here is threatening to one of 
the most powerful interest groups in America. The abortion industry has 
taken to attacking this bill wildly over the course of the last 2 
weeks, even though, as we made clear repeatedly and as the text of this 
bill makes indisputably clear, this bill has nothing to do with 
abortion itself. Nothing in this bill changes the slightest letter of 
Roe v. Wade. Nothing touches abortion access in this bill.
  This bill is about living and breathing babies who are alive outside 
the womb. That is all that the text of this bill does, but Planned 
Parenthood and NARAL and their allies feel threatened by a bill to 
protect alive, out-of-the-womb babies. In other words, unlike this 
legislation, Planned Parenthood and others refuse to draw any line 
between abortion and infanticide. That is what their lobbying the last 
week has shown. That should tell us something about what these groups 
are really about. What they are about is a society built on power--the 
power of some people to decide whether other people get to live or die.
  This bill is a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that some lives 
are less valuable than others. This bill is a stumbling block to anyone 
who thinks that certain human beings should be disposable. This bill is 
a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that we should be able to 
quietly rid ourselves of little people who were ``inconvenient'' or 
supposedly ``unwanted.''
  They are not unwanted. There are lots of people in every single State 
in this Union lined up waiting to adopt, including kids who have lots 
of hard life circumstances. In every State there are waiting lists of 
people who will take so-called unwanted babies.
  America is a country built on a different principle. Ours is a 
country dedicated to the proposition that all men and women--all boys 
and girls--are created equal, even the littlest--even if they happen to 
come into the world under the most horrible circumstances, even if they 
are crippled or inconvenient, or, apparently, for a moment, unwanted. 
Ours is a country that recognizes the fundamental indistinguishable 
dignity of every human being, regardless of race, or sex, or creed, or 
ability. As a country, we have struggled for 2 centuries--sometimes at 
enormous cost--to extend those basic human rights to more and more of 
our fellow citizens. Today's vote is simply an opportunity to continue 
that work.
  Let me say by way of closing that despite oppositions and setbacks 
and despite some strange rhetoric about this bill over the course of 
the last week, I am hopeful in the long term. Deep down, each of us 
knows that every member of our human family ought to be protected and 
deserves to be cherished and loved. The love we see every day in the 
eyes of moms and dads for their newborn babies is an inescapable 
reminder of that fundamental truth. Love is stronger than power.
  Thank you, Madam President.",S001197,2019-02-25

History Month, to recognize, honor, and pay tribute to five 
Pennsylvanians who have committed themselves to creating innovative 
solutions to our Nation's most pressing problems.
  For 13 years, I have stood on this floor on this Monday, every year, 
to pay tribute to Pennsylvanians. Sometimes it has been one individual, 
and sometimes it has been more than one, but today we have five 
honorees.
  While these innovators hail from different backgrounds and have each 
mastered a different craft, they share one thing in common, and that is 
a commitment to their communities and to improving the lives of others 
in groundbreaking ways.
  Today, we will honor the individual work of the following people. I 
will list them for you first and then talk about each of them in 
succession: first, the Reverend Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake; second, Joan 
Myers Brown; third, Sulaiman Rahman; fourth, Rakia Reynolds; and fifth, 
Omar Woodward. You will hear more about each of them in a moment. There 
is no one way, of course, to make a difference in our society. I hope 
the stories of today's honorees will help to inspire the next 
generation of leaders. These honorees are with us here in Washington 
today, and we are grateful to have the chance to spend a couple of 
minutes talking about each of them.
  Let me start with the Reverend Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake, someone I 
have known for a long time. This is the story of a woman who has spent 
her life working to build healthier communities by advancing the 
conversation on issues like the opioid crisis and health disparities in 
our Nation, just to mention two things.
  Lorina Marshall-Blake's life began in West Philadelphia, alongside 
her sister and three brothers. She excelled in her education, earning 
degrees from Antioch College and the University of Pennsylvania.
  Today, Lorina is vice president of community affairs for Independence 
Blue Cross and also president of the Independence Blue Cross 
Foundation. Lorina has spent the better part of 30 years working to 
improve access and healthcare outcomes for those across


the region of Southeastern Pennsylvania, which is Philadelphia and the 
counties and communities around the city of Philadelphia. Her faith-
driven work continues outside of the office, where she serves as an 
associate minister at the Vine Memorial Baptist Church.
  Lorina is affiliated with over 30 professional and civic 
organizations. I will just mention a few: The United Negro College 
Fund, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, and the Urban 
Affairs Coalition. While the health and well-being of our Nation is not 
perfect, it is in great part thanks to women like Lorina Marshall-Blake 
that the future of healthcare and the future of access to healthcare is 
only brighter.
  The second individual we are honoring is Joan Myers Brown. We all 
know that art itself has the power to enrich lives and inspire change. 
At the age of 17, Joan Myers Brown decided she was going to be a 
professional ballerina. She refused to let pervasive racism and 
segregation stop her from touring as a member of dance revues for Cab 
Calloway, Pearl Bailey, and Sammy Davis, Jr.
  After excelling in her own right, she decided she wanted to give 
opportunity to others. To that end, in 1960, Joan Myers Brown started 
her own dance school in West Philadelphia called the Philadelphia 
School of Dance Arts. Building on that work, she founded the 
Philadelphia Dance Company in 1970. This dance company was created to 
provide opportunities for Black dancers who were systemically denied 
entrance to local schools. The company continues to be recognized 
across the world for its dancers and for its performances.
  Personally, Joan is an industry icon in both the national and 
international art communities. For example, in 2005, the Kennedy Center 
honored her as a master of African-American choreography, and in 2009, 
she received the prestigious Philadelphia Award. In 2012, she received 
the National Medal of the Arts, the Nation's highest civic honor for 
excellence in the arts. The arts have benefited greatly from Joan Myers 
Brown.
  Third is Sulaiman Rahman. No individual's success is achieved alone. 
We know that, and many in Philadelphia and beyond owe some of their 
success to Mr. Rahman. He has dedicated his life to empowering young 
professionals to personal and professional success.
  After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Sulaiman 
started his career as an entrepreneur. He founded a platform for urban 
professionals to find local social, civic, and business events, and he 
successfully built an international marketing and distributing 
business.
  With the goal of ending the opportunity gap for people of color, 
Sulaiman created the Urban Philly Professional Network and, later, 
DiverseForce, and the DiverseForce on Boards program. Every day he 
works to empower and connect the diverse leaders from multiple sectors 
and communities. He creates high-tech solutions to impact a more 
diverse business culture.
  When he is not running DiverseForce, he is serving on a number of 
boards, including the Community College of Philadelphia Foundation, 
TeenSHARP, and the Year Up Greater Philadelphia Chapter.
  Rakia Reynolds. We know that some of our Nation's greatest successes 
have been born out of interdisciplinary collaboration. Few in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania know how to bring people together for new 
opportunities like Rakia Reynolds. From her earliest days as a child 
reading the book ``A Wrinkle in Time,'' she has always been committed 
to making things happen.
  She is a New Jersey native. She moved to Philadelphia to pursue a

1589,BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED-- Resumed,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1414-3,10,Mrs. FISCHER,"  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to voice my full support for 
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, offered by my 
colleague from Nebraska.
  Today's vote on this important bill is going to give every Member of 
the Senate a chance to show America where one stands on the basic right 
of care for newborn babies.
  Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong 
supporter of pro-life policies that show compassion to women and 
children. During my time in the Nebraska Legislature, we passed the 
first statewide ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks. Members from 
all points of the political spectrum--Republican, Democratic, pro-life, 
and pro-choice--came together to support that bill. We have the 
opportunity today to come together--Republicans and Democrats--to stand 
up for the lives of newborn infants in the U.S. Senate.
  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act protects the lives 
of children who survive attempted abortions. Simply put, if a baby 
survives an abortion, he or she deserves the same medical care as any 
other child who is born prematurely. Without question, newborns deserve 
care, attention, and love. This should not be a divisive issue. This is 
an issue that is fundamental to what it means to be an American citizen 
and, more so, what it means to be a human being. Our Founding Fathers 
believed, unequivocally, that every person born in the United States 
has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Born-
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be, without any doubt, a 
measure that is passed in the Senate.
  Like most Nebraskans, I have been deeply disturbed by the actions in 
Virginia, New York, and the new extremes that have been pushed in the 
ensuing national debate that it is OK to deny newborn abortion 
survivors medical


care. As we all know, a bill was introduced in the Virginia House of 
Delegates that would make it easier to get a third-term abortion. When 
discussing this legislation, the Governor of Virginia recently made 
extremely disturbing comments in defending the bill and promoting 
infanticide when he described the process of an abortion procedure 
taking place while a mother was in labor. These policies and lines of 
thought fly in the face of our core values, and they have to end.
  In leading up to the vote today, critics across the aisle have 
mounted a campaign of misinformation to try to knock this bill off 
course. To be clear, this legislation does not set any limits on the 
rights of one to obtain an abortion or abortion procedures or methods. 
The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would ensure that if 
newborns survive abortions, then they would receive the same care and 
the same attention to their health as would any other newborn. Newborn 
children should never be treated without basic human rights or the full 
protection of our laws because they are not wanted, especially when 
reports have estimated that nearly 2 million couples in the United 
States are currently waiting to adopt children--2 million.
  There is simply no excuse for an infant not to receive lifesaving 
care. We live in a nation that was founded upon the basic rights of 
dignity, self-worth, and equality for every human being. In 2002, the 
Born-Alive Infants Protection Act passed the House of Representatives 
by a voice vote; it passed the Senate by unanimous consent; and it was 
signed into law by President Bush. We have the chance right now to 
build upon that 2002 consensus that those who survive abortions are, in 
fact, people and to clarify that they deserve medical care. We can come 
together today to support this sound policy once more. We can clarify, 
in light of the extremism we have seen displayed recently, that newborn 
abortion survivors deserve medical care.
  I thank my fellow Nebraskan for his good work on this bill, and I 
will be voting to affirm that children deserve protection at every 
stage of life.
  I ask all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this measure and 
to vote in favor of this important bill that is before us.

colleagues in standing up for doctors and patients in my home State of 
Minnesota and across the country.
  S. 311 puts Congress in the middle of the important medical decisions 
that patients and doctors should make together without having political 
interference. It would compel physicians to provide unnecessary medical 
care. It would override physicians' professional judgments about what 
is best for their patients, and it would put physicians in the position 
of facing criminal penalties if their judgments about what is best for 
their patients are contrary to what is described in this bill.
  Colleagues, let me be clear. For women, this is a healthcare issue, 
not a political issue, and this bill, I fear, interferes with the 
doctor-patient relationship, which should worry us all. We can all 
agree that people deserve the best medical care based on their 
individual needs and their doctors' best medical advice. This is how 
our medical system is supposed to work--physicians and patients making 
decisions together that are based on patients' individual needs.
  Everybody is different. For example, any oncologist will tell you 
that each cancer patient's treatment is different. Treatment plans 
depend on the type of cancer and how advanced the cancer is. Decisions 
about cancer treatments also depend on each person's age and lifestyle 
and individual circumstances. The same is true when it comes to 
pregnancy. Any obstetrician will tell you that every pregnancy is 
different and that when complications arise, they can completely change 
the course of treatment. In that moment, women and their families and 
their doctors are the only ones who are able to make decisions about 
what is best for a woman and her pregnancy.
  Think about what this means in real life. In August of 2016, Tippy, 
who is from Minnesota and has agreed for me to share her story, was 
pregnant and, with her husband, went to their 20-week ultrasound 
appointment. They were excited because they thought they were about to 
find out the gender of their new baby, and they had already bought 
decorations for the gender reveal party. Instead, Tippy and her husband 
got devastating news from that ultrasound. Their baby, a boy, had 
stopped developing properly and would not survive. They would never get 
to meet him and never get to hold him. The ultrasound revealed not only 
the tragic news about this much wanted child but also showed a 
dangerous condition that threatened Tippy's own health. Tippy's 
placenta was enlarged, and to continue her pregnancy would risk the 
health of her reproductive system and her ability to have future 
children of her own.
  Tippy, with her family and her doctor, made the difficult decision to 
have an abortion in order to save her reproductive system. Because she 
was able to make that medical decision, she was able to have another 
baby a year later. Tippy and her husband are today the proud parents of 
an 18-month-old child. When Tippy and her husband made their decision, 
it was based on guidance from her doctor and what was right for them 
and the family they hoped to have in the future.
  They didn't need politicians to be looking over their shoulders in 
the doctor's office and telling them what to do. None of us in this 
body should be in the business of interfering in that doctor-patient 
relationship. We don't tell oncologists how to treat their patients; we 
don't tell emergency room doctors how to save lives; and we shouldn't 
tell women's doctors how to take care of their patients.
  Colleagues, that is what this bill does. It would give politicians in 
this room the power to make medical decisions for women and their 
families. This bill intimidates providers and forces physicians to 
provide inappropriate medical treatment even when it is not in the best 
interests of their patients or their families.
  Colleagues, we should treat women with respect. Decisions about 
women's healthcare aren't different from decisions about men's 
healthcare, so why are we treating women differently? This legislation, 
if it were to become law, would put doctors in an untenable position: 
Do they follow the law or do they follow their code of professional 
ethics?
  Colleagues, let's get out of the business of dictating medical care 
for women. Let's continue to trust women and their doctors. I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this legislation.

important bill, I am hearing two different strategies, two different 
discussions, about what is actually on the floor in front of us. You 
see, my colleagues across the aisle are debating a bill that is not in 
front of us. They are talking about healthcare for women, which is 
abortion. That is what they are talking about.
  This bill does not address abortion. It does not address women's 
healthcare issues. What this bill does is address the healthcare of a 
baby who is born alive after a botched abortion. We are not talking 
about abortion, folks. We are talking about the life of a child who is 
born. So, while my colleagues across the aisle are saying this is about 
abortion, that this is about a mother's healthcare, that is absolutely 
incorrect. We are talking about a human life.
  In recent weeks, we have witnessed the ugly truth about the far-
reaching grasp of the abortion industry and its ever-increasingly 
radicalized political agenda. Some politicians have not only defended 
aborting a child while a woman is in labor but have gone so far as to 
support the termination of a child after his birth. This assault on 
human dignity cannot stand. We can and must do better, and we can as a 
nation do better to defend and uphold the basic values of compassion 
and decency that define our very society.
  I thank the junior Senator from Nebraska for offering this 
commonsense legislation that addresses this issue in a compassionate 
manner and provides critical protections for children who are born 
alive after surviving abortions.


  Although previous laws were passed that recognize infants born alive 
during abortion proceedings as legal persons, there still exists a 
critical loophole that prevents abortionists from being held 
accountable for failing to follow these very laws.
  This legislation closes the gap and ensures that there are concrete 
enforcement measures to protect children who survive abortion attempts.
  We can all agree that any child who is born alive, whether through a 
natural birth or a botched abortion, is a living person, a person who 
is worthy of the utmost dignity, compassion, and respect. This 
legislation ensures just that by simply requiring healthcare 
practitioners to treat those babies who survive an abortion attempt 
with the same degree of care any other baby born at the same 
gestational age would receive.
  This legislation is not meant to punish women or mothers during an 
often heart-wrenching and difficult experience. In fact, this 
legislation specifically prohibits mothers from being prosecuted. 
Instead, this bill quite simply imposes penalties for the intentional 
killing of a baby who has been born alive.
  Today, we have an opportunity to categorically reject infanticide by 
ensuring that the laws we have on the books preventing this abhorrent 
practice are meaningfully enforced and that those who fail to follow 
such laws can be held accountable.
  I urge my colleagues to set aside partisanship and support this much 
needed, compassionate solution. We as a nation can do better. We must 
protect those babies who are born alive.

legislation that the Presiding Officer has authored. It would 
significantly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, and it 
would pose new obstacles to a woman's constitutionally protected right 
to make her own decisions about her reproductive health.
  Regardless of what the intent of the legislation is, the fact is, the 
way it is written, it intimidates doctors with the threat of criminal 
liability for performing safe and legal abortions. It will have a 
chilling effect on the ability of women to access the services they 
need in the United States.
  We must always remember that abortions that are performed later in 
pregnancy are most often done as the result of severe fetal diagnoses 
and the serious risks that pregnancy poses to the life of the mother.
  And let's be very clear: This isn't a decision that any women or 
family wants to be in a position to make. It is tragic and it is 
heartbreaking, and efforts to politicize the trauma of women and 
families who have been forced to make this decision are really 
shameful, and it sets a dangerous precedent for women's comprehensive 
healthcare.
  By installing new uncertainty and risk of criminal liability into the 
process for late-term abortions, this legislation increases the risk 
that women will not be able to get the medical care they need when 
their pregnancy poses a risk to their lives. This bill ignores those 
important realities in what appears to be an attempt to score political 
points with anti-choice groups.
  Again and again, at every turn, we have seen this administration and 
our Republican colleagues push forward policies intended to threaten 
access to abortion care. Just last week, the Trump administration cut 
off critical family planning resources for family planning clinics that 
offer information and referrals for women seeking to obtain legal 
abortions. If you want to prevent abortions, you want to make sure 
families have access to family planning. We know that is an important 
way to reduce the number of abortions in this country.
  So we are seeing that this bill is just another line of attack in the 
ongoing war on women's health. Now more than ever, we need to stand up 
and help protect women's healthcare and make certain that abortions 
remain safe and legal.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and its consideration 
on the Senate floor.

for her steadfast leadership in the fight to protect women's healthcare 
and for arranging this time for us to speak this afternoon.
  The legislation we are debating today is just the latest salvo in the 
far-right wing assault on a woman's constitutionally protected right to 
an abortion.
  With all due respect to my colleague from Nebraska who introduced 
this legislation, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. 
Contrary to what the proponents of this bill argue, it is and has 
always been a crime to harm or kill newborn babies. People guilty of 
this crime can already be charged and prosecuted to the full extent of 
the law.
  Let's be clear. The Senate isn't debating this legislation today 
because there is an epidemic of infanticide in this country. There is 
not one. There isn't one. I can hardly say it because it is really not 
happening; therefore, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. 
Instead, we are indulging the majority's use of a false premise to 
inflame the public, shame women, and intimidate healthcare providers.
  When you strip away the ultraconservative rhetoric, you are left with 
a very simple argument from supporters of this legislation--that the 
moral judgment of rightwing politicians in Washington, DC, should 
supersede a medical professional's judgment and a woman's decision. 
Conservative politicians should not be telling doctors how they should 
care for their patients. Instead, women, in consultation with their 
families and doctors, are in the best position to determine their best 
course of care.
  In talking to healthcare providers in Hawaii, I have heard how this 
legislation and other bills like it in States across the country could 
force them to provide care that is unnecessary or even harmful to 
patients. The Hawaii Section of the College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists made this point persuasively in testimony recently 
submitted to our State legislature's house committee on health earlier 
this month. In opposing similar so-called born-alive abortion 
legislation heard in Hawaii's State Legislature--which didn't make it 
out of committee, by the way--the group of doctors wrote:

       We are physicians who provide compassionate, evidence-based 
     care. By criminalizing healthcare providers, this law may 
     actually reduce the number of healthcare providers (not just 
     the surgeons, but anesthesiologists, nurses, midwives, office 
     staff) willing to provide this care. But again, that is the 
     actual intent of this bill. Reducing access to safe abortion 
     care would threaten the health of women in Hawaii.
       We are the physicians who care for patients when they find 
     out their very wanted, very loved baby has severe fetal 
     anomalies. Families sometimes choose to end the pregnancy and 
     provide their baby with palliative care rather than subject 
     their baby to any suffering or futile efforts at 
     resuscitation. These families face very difficult decisions 
     about what their values are and what is best for their 
     family; decisions that none of us has a right to make for 
     them or judge them for. What they need in these moments is 
     compassion and medically accurate information from healthcare 
     providers free of judgment or politics.

  I couldn't agree more, and that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose 
this legislation.
  In just a few minutes, I expect the Senate will defeat this bill 
because it will fail to win the required 60 votes. Nevertheless, the 
threat to women's reproductive rights is intensifying in States and 
courtrooms all across the country. Over the past few years, States have 
enacted hundreds--hundreds--of laws that harm women's health and 
violate their constitutional right to an abortion.
  Mississippi enacted a prohibition on abortion after 15 weeks of 
pregnancy.
  Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Ohio have passed laws banning 
dilation and evacuation--D&E--an abortion procedure used usually during 
the second trimester.
  Indiana enacted a bevy of new abortion restrictions, including a law 
requiring every woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound--talk 
about invasive--and mandated she wait 18 hours after the ultrasound to 
have an abortion.
  Louisiana passed legislation requiring abortion providers to have 
admitting privileges at local hospitals. This law would result in only 
one abortion provider in a State of 4.7 million people.
  Advocates have recognized the harm these laws would have on women and


have filed suits to block their implementation. Several lower courts 
have ruled these restrictions unconstitutional, and the cases are 
moving steadily through the courts of appeals en route to the Supreme 
Court.
  The Fifth Circuit, for example, will hear an appeal of a lower 
court's decision to block Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, as well 
as an appeal from Texas to allow its ban on D&E procedures to go into 
effect.
  The Seventh Circuit upheld a lower court ruling striking down parts 
of Indiana's mandatory ultrasound and waiting period law. The Indiana 
attorney general has requested the Supreme Court to review this case.
  The Supreme Court temporarily stopped Louisiana's so-called admitting 
privileges law from taking effect on a 5-to-4 vote. This is the law I 
talked about before. This law would result in one abortion provider in 
a State of 4.7 million people.
  The Fifth Circuit will now hear an appeal on the merits of the law, 
which is virtually identical to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck 
down in 2016--that was only a few short years ago--in the landmark 
Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt decision.
  The stakes in these court battles and the more than 20 other 
abortion-related cases making their way through the Federal court are 
incredibly high. Any one of them would provide the opening for the U.S. 
Supreme Court to finally fulfill the rightwing goal of overturning Roe 
v. Wade.
  It is with this central goal in mind that Donald Trump, Majority 
Leader McConnell, and complicit Republicans of Congress have been 
working to pack our Federal courts with ideologically driven judges 
groomed and handpicked by ultraconservative organizations like the 
Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.
  Donald Trump has already confirmed 85 judges, including 30 to circuit 
courts and 2 to the U.S. Supreme Court. These judges comprise one-tenth 
of the Federal judiciary, with many more to come.
  In fact, a few weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 42--
42--judicial nominees out of committee in one markup. Those 42 comprise 
an additional 5 percent of the Federal judiciary.
  Less than 2 weeks ago, Justice Kavanaugh issued a strong dissent in 
the earlier mentioned Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision to block 
Louisiana's anti-choice law from taking effect. Using tortured 
reasoning, Justice Kavanaugh essentially argued that the Supreme Court 
should disregard its own precedent from only 2 years ago--that is the 
Whole Women's case I referred to--to allow the Louisiana law to take 
effect. His dissent signaled his strong antipathy to a woman's right to 
choose, just as his dissent in Garza v. Hargan did when he was on the 
DC Circuit. His dissent as a Justice this time demonstrated the 
emptiness of his promises to uphold Supreme Court precedent during his 
confirmation hearing.
  Justice Kavanaugh's promises then to follow precedent is like that of 
other Federalist Society-picked Trump nominees now packing our courts, 
offering little reassurance that nominees in fact will set aside their 
strongly held ideological views to be objective and fair as judges.
  Another case likely to make its way through Federal courts in the 
months and years ahead is a challenge to the Trump administration's new 
gag rule. This rule prohibits doctors and other clinicians 
participating in title X family planning programs from referring 
patients for, or even speaking about, abortions, even if their patients 
request such information.
  Nearly 20,000 Hawaii residents receive reproductive healthcare 
through title X. That is roughly the population of the city of Kapolei 
on Oahu. This attack on title X-funded agencies like Planned Parenthood 
is an end-run around Congress after Republicans have tried and failed 
dozens of times to end funding for Planned Parenthood.
  Planned Parenthood provides healthcare for millions--millions--of 
low-income women, men, and young people under title X. Why then do 
Republicans persist in trying to cut funding for Planned Parenthood?
  The constitutional rights of millions of women across the country are 
under serious and sustained attack, but even in these not normal times, 
I do see some hope. As State after State passes laws to limit access 
for a woman's right to choose, communities like Hawaii's are coming 
together to protect such access.
  Last week, I joined activists and staff from Planned Parenthood of 
the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands as they opened their new 
medical center and administrative hub in downtown Honolulu. I was 
particularly energized to see how many young people, women and men, 
were there and engaged in the fight to protect our right to choice.
  I have learned over the years that battles we fought so hard to win 
never stay won. It is up to all of us to stay engaged and keep fighting 
for our constitutionally protected rights.

that is before the U.S. Senate today. We are not here to debate 
abortion. That is not what this bill is about that Senator Sasse has 
introduced. We are here to decide whether it should be legal in the 
United States of America to kill or neglect an infant who has been born 
alive after a botched abortion.
  This was made very real for me just minutes ago. In fact, Melissa 
Odom is standing just off the floor of the U.S. Senate, just outside 
here probably 50 feet from where I am standing. She survived a botched 
saline-infused abortion in 1977. She was left to die, literally put in 
the medical waste heap, but thanks to the grace of God and a nurse who 
saw Melissa, they were able to revive her, and she is a beautiful 41-
year-old mom with two children, one being Olivia who was born in the 
same hospital where the botched abortion took place. She is from Kansas 
City, married to Ryan.
  We are here to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection 
Act. By now, we have all heard the disturbing defense of infanticide 
offered by the disgraced Governor Northam of Virginia. These babies' 
only crime was to survive the abortionists' attempts to poison, starve, 
or tear them apart limb from limb while in utero.
  What this bill is about is when the abortionist wants to ``finish the 
job'' as the baby lies helpless on the table of an abortion clinic. 
Currently, children born alive who survive an abortion attempt are 
recognized as persons under the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 
2002, but that law is merely definitional because not one person to 
date has been charged or convicted under it. There is no nationwide 
Federal law criminalizing the actions of killers, like Dr. Kermit 
Gosnell, who kill or deny care to babies who survive abortions. Current 
Federal murder statutes have limited jurisdiction, and the States have 
a patchwork of different laws for born-alive infants.
  The bill we are voting on today would give Federal enforcement teeth 
nationwide to the 2002 Born-Alive law, so that whether an infant is 
born alive in Montana or in Massachusetts, whether in a hospital or an 
abortion clinic, they would be guaranteed the same protection and level 
of care. Is that asking too much?
  By contrast, consider that Federal law provides criminal penalties of 
thousands of dollars in fines and even imprisonment if you ``harass, 
harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect'' any 
baby marine turtle, baby bald eagle, or any other baby of an endangered 
species.
  It is absolutely absurd that we are having to decide whether we give 
human babies the level of protection under Federal law that we give to 
animals. This is truly an absurd moment on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. Have we become so numb as a nation that we cannot realize we 
are talking about a baby?

little Emma Rae Daines, born in Denver. She is now a living, breathing 
member of the human family. That is what we are talking about here, a 
living, breathing member of the human family. Is it the position of the 
Democratic Party that a border wall is immoral but not infanticide?
  The phenomenon of infants surviving attempted abortions is very real. 
These infants are not just statistics. Their lives matter, and their 
stories deserve to be told, just like the story of Melissa Odom. That 
is why I am proud of


and grateful to my Senate colleague Ben Sasse, who has introduced the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
  Infanticide is not and should not be a partisan issue. It is an issue 
in which there should be no middle ground or compromise. A ``yes'' vote 
today is to uphold the bare minimum of any civilized society. A ``no'' 
vote is to deny protection from barbaric violence to the most 
vulnerable among us, an innocent, little baby.
  You can either stand with Governor Northam for infanticide or you can 
protect the most vulnerable among us.

1601,BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED-- Resumed,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1414-3,22,Mr. ROUNDS,"  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from Montana 
for his powerful message. I can assure him that I believe strongly in 
the same approach as he does with regard to life.
  I rise to discuss an issue of vital importance to our society, and 
that is the intrinsic value of human life. Very shortly, every Senator 
will have an opportunity to stand up for human dignity and condemn 
infanticide when we vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act. This should not be a difficult vote for any of us.
  I believe in the value of every innocent human life, beginning at the 
moment of conception to natural death. Life is a gift from God that 
should be respected and treated with dignity from the very beginning to 
the very end.
  I have worked to enact pro-life policies throughout my time in public 
service based upon this principle. While working as Governor, I signed 
legislation to ban abortions in South Dakota, except when necessary to 
save a mother's life.
  ``Humanae Vitae,'' written by Pope Paul IV and later expanded upon in 
``Evangelium Vitae,'' written by Saint Pope John Paul II the Great, 
teaches that there can be no true democracy without a recognition of 
the dignity of every person. It goes on to teach that respect and 
dignity must be given to each human life for true peace and freedom to 
exist.
  We must demand respect for the rights of all. This includes those in 
the womb, as well as mothers carrying a child who are facing difficult 
challenges. Both deserve our utmost compassion and care. While this 
should be common sense to everyone, we recognize that in this country 
there are individuals who are pro-life and individuals who are pro-
choice.
  While I and millions of other pro-life Americans continue to work to 
end all abortions and support measures that strengthen the dignity of 
life, recent actions at the State level have been deeply troubling. 
Pro-choice individuals are actually now supporting measures that will 
allow doctors to commit infanticide even after a baby has been born 
alive. For example, last month, the State of New York repealed section 
4164 of the State's public health law which provided protections for an 
infant born alive after a failed abortion. Subsequently, in Virginia, 
legislation has been introduced that would legalize abortion up to term 
and even after the birth has begun. In Rhode Island, the Governor has 
vowed to sign legislation legalizing abortion even after the child is 
viable.
  These examples of abortion extremism at its worst--radical, abhorrent 
acts of infanticide--should horrify all of us. While I am troubled by 
the thought of any baby being killed at any stage, at a bare minimum 
every one of us should be able to agree that infanticide--or the 
killing of a baby after it has been born alive--is unacceptable. This 
is a separate issue from abortion, which is abhorrent in itself.
  In the history of the world, the true test of a society is how well 
we treat the most vulnerable among us. That is why we must pass this 
legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, of which 
I am an original cosponsor, and I would like to thank Senator Sasse for 
bringing this legislation forward.
  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act simply protects 
newborns who survive abortions by requiring appropriate care and 
admission to a hospital. When a failed abortion results in the live 
birth of an infant, our legislation makes clear that healthcare 
providers must exercise the same degree of professional skill to 
protect the newborn child as would be offered to any other child born 
alive at the same gestational age. A baby who survives an abortion 
deserves the same rights under the law as any other newborn baby and 
should receive proper medical care, not to be left to die or be killed.
  It is also worth mentioning that President Trump stood up for life 
during the State of the Union Address earlier this month, calling on 
Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions of 
children who feel pain in the mother's womb. President Trump urged:

       Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes 
     innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All 
     children--born and unborn--are made in the holy image of God.

  I couldn't agree more. All life is sacred. We must seek to protect 
and save lives whenever possible, however possible. I urge my 
colleagues to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.

1605,BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SURVIVORS PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED-- Resumed,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgS1414-3,26,Ms. DUCKWORTH,"  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, imagine the joy, the emotion, and the 
anticipation that comes with being in the third trimester of your 
pregnancy. Imagine choosing the crib and the mobiles that will hang 
above it. Imagine telling your toddler that he was getting a little 
sister to play with. Then, imagine the heartbreak of going to the 
doctor one day and learning that there is no chance your baby will 
survive, that there is no hope your baby girl will ever speak her first 
word or take her first step, or that delivering her would put your own 
life at risk, leaving your firstborn to grow up without a mother. These 
are the types of scenarios that lead to the heart-wrenching decision to 
terminate a pregnancy later on.
  As the mom of two little girls--one, age 4, and one, 10 months old--I 
can't begin to fathom that kind of pain. Yet today some on the other 
side of the aisle are trying to use those parents' suffering for 
political advantage, making worst-case scenarios like these all the 
more difficult by pushing a bill aimed to criminalize reproductive care 
no matter the cost.
  If it becomes law, this bill would force doctors to perform 
ineffective, invasive procedures on fetuses born with fatal 
abnormalities, even if it is against the best interests of the child, 
even if it goes against recommended standards of care and they know 
that it wouldn't extend or improve the baby's life, and even if it 
would prolong the suffering of the families, forcing women to endure 
added lasting trauma, making one of the worst moments of their lives 
somehow even more painful. If physicians refuse, they would be punished 
and could be sentenced up to 5 years in prison.
  We have seen this kind of political stunt before. We know the 
partisan extremist playbook it comes out of--one based not in fact but 
in fiction, steeped in ignorance and misogyny. The goal here is 
obvious: to bully doctors out of giving reproductive care, to scare 
them out of business--one potential lawsuit or jail sentence at a 
time--making it even harder for women to get the care they need when 
they need it most, as the number of physicians available shrinks.
  This is just the latest step in the far right's long march to strip 
away women's rights--a march whose pace has now quickened under our 
current President, a man who once argued that women should be punished 
for taking up their right to choose, who has taken pride in trying to 
put the government between women and their doctors, and who just 72 
hours ago issued a gag rule that could gut family planning clinics.
  I have said this a thousand times before, and I will keep saying it 
until I go hoarse: A woman's medical decisions should be between her 
and her physician and her family and not dictated by some politician in 
Washington, DC. When lives are on the line, the folks with MDs are the 
ones who should be deciding what care is appropriate, not those with 
partisan agendas.
  Mothers and doctors know that every pregnancy is different--both of 
mine


certainly were--and physicians are trained with exactly this in mind.
  It is offensive and just plain ignorant for my colleagues to claim 
they know better than a doctor or an expectant mom. It shows an 
alarming disrespect for a woman's moral compass and her ability to make 
sound decisions.
  I can't begin to conceive of the pain of the mom-to-be who learns 
that the baby she already loves isn't viable and that the child whose 
name she has already chosen and whose life she has already imagined 
will never open their eyes. All this bill would do is to sharpen that 
family's suffering. All it would do is to make it harder for the next 
woman to get the care that could save her life. How dare we think of 
passing legislation like that. How dare we put extremist politics over 
empathy, over science, and over women's health and families' pain.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against S. 311--a bill that is 
as heartless as it is dangerous.
  Thank you.

debate today about how heartless it would be to protect the life of a 
child. The debate from the other side has come out fast and furious, 
saying that S. 311 is about a child who is not viable and that somehow 
we are going to put a mom through more torment with a child that is not 
viable.
  The plain text of this bill could not be clearer. This is not about 
abortion. This is about a child who has been born alive and who is a 
viable child.
  Here is the interesting conversation. Many people in this country 
argue about abortion--rightfully so. We are talking about the life of a 
child. This, in particular, though, has a clear argument. What if an 
abortion is botched, and instead of the child being killed in the womb, 
they are actually delivered? Now a child is on the table who is crying, 
with pink skin, 10 fingers and toes wiggling, and is reaching out. What 
happens now? That is the question with this bill.
  Interestingly enough, it is not the first time it has come before the 
Senate. In 2002, this same issue came before the Senate. The Senate, 
the House, and the President all agreed that if an abortion was botched 
and the child was delivered, that child is a child. By definition, that 
is a child. In 2002, what that bill did not do is define what happens 
next if the life of that child is then taken after they are born.
  This wouldn't be an issue because it is clearly defined in law except 
for the fact that a few weeks ago, the Governor of Virginia made a 
public statement saying that we need to have a law to say that we could 
deliver a child, make it comfortable, and then decide what to do with 
that baby. Suddenly, this becomes a national conversation.
  We thought this was a resolved issue in 2002, but it is not. There is 
still debate from the other side saying: Deliver the child and then 
decide what to do with the life of that child.
  This is not just an issue that has no consequence as well. After that 
bill was passed in 2002, the CDC started analyzing birth certificates 
to determine if this happens and how often it happens.
  It doesn't happen often, but in a few number of States where the CDC 
gathered information from, it determined there were 143 babies who were 
born alive after an attempted abortion and who then died with no record 
of how it happened.
  Just in 5 months in 2017, the State of Arizona reported that 10 
babies were born alive after an attempted abortion. This doesn't happen 
often, but it does happen, and the question is, Who are we as a nation 
and what are we going to do with a child who is in front of us who is 
alive?
  Medical professionals are called to do no harm--the Hippocratic Oath. 
It is interesting to see medical professionals provide care to every 
person everywhere they go. If there is a car accident, it doesn't 
matter if it is their patient. They pull over and help. Interestingly 
enough, at the State of the Union Address, just a couple of weeks ago, 
we had a staff member in the back who passed out, and Members of 
Congress who are also physicians, who were in their seats, jumped out 
of their seats to go provide care because that is what physicians do. 
But in the case of a botched abortion, the child is delivered and then 
everyone who is a medical professional just steps back and watches the 
child die and doesn't provide care. It is the reverse of the 
Hippocratic Oath. We need to resolve this in our law.
  If I can even make a comparison. We as people, and even soldiers in 
the field, honor life. Soldiers who were trained to take life still are 
also trained to honor life.
  Article 12 of the Geneva Convention, which we support, says this: 
``Members of the armed forces and other persons . . . who were wounded, 
sick . . . shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.'' 
Literally, if you are in the fight of your life on the field, as our 
Armed Forces are, and you run across a wounded individual in that fight 
from the other side, we give care to that person, even though they are 
our enemy on the battlefield. But in an abortion clinic, that child is 
not given the same care that we are demanded to give on the 
battlefield.
  This is a fascinating dialogue that I have had with a lot of my 
colleagues. For a lot of my colleagues who are pro-abortion and who 
don't see that as a life, I will often ask this simple question: When 
is a life a life? What is your redline? I think that is a fair 
conversation.
  For myself, it is conception. When that child is conceived and they 
are developing, they have unique DNA. That is a different person. For 
others, they will say it is when the child is viable. For others, they 
will say when the child is born.
  I just ask a simple question. When the child is born, is that a 
child? Is your redline birth? This bill affirms that when a child is 
born, we should at least acknowledge that that is a person.
  I am a dad who has cut the umbilical cord of my own daughter before. 
I would be terrified to say that the child was not a child until I, as 
the dad, cut the cord--that I could take that life at any moment before 
that. That is not who we are as Americans.
  Let's pass this. Let's protect living children.
  With that, I yield the floor.",L000575,2019-02-25

vote to advance S. 311. This legislation would reduce families' access 
to reproductive healthcare, interfere in personal medical decisions 
that should be left between families and doctors, and criminalize 
doctors and health professionals.
  Tonight's vote is part of a broader strategy by this administration 
and some in Congress to take away women's access to reproductive 
healthcare, including the constitutional right to an abortion affirmed 
in Roe v. Wade.
  For instance, the administration has already installed two Supreme 
Court Justices who threaten Roe v. Wade, repeatedly tried to de-fund 
Planned Parenthood and cut off family planning grants, and given 
employers the green light to take away birth control coverage from 
their employees. In the last Congress alone there were 14 anti-women's 
health votes and 34 anti-women's health bills introduced.
  Reproductive health choices are highly personal and deeply sensitive, 
and they should be left between families and their doctor. S. 311 would 
effectively overrule these personal decisions by imposing arbitrary 
standards--based on political ideology, not medical appropriateness--on 
health professionals.
  This bill would effectively criminalize doctors and healthcare 
clinicians for providing the best plan of care to their patients. It 
would impose civil and criminal penalties including up to 5 years in 
prison onto providers if they don't comply with the bill's mandates. 
These mandates could scare medical professionals away from helping 
women and families obtain reproductive care, including an abortion, 
further reducing families' access to care.
  More than 17 of the Nation's leading medical, public health, and 
civil rights organizations oppose this bill. The American College of 
Nurse-Midwives, the American College of Obstetricians


and Gynecologists, and the American Public Health Association state 
that the bill ``. . . injects politicians into the patient-provider 
relationship, disregarding providers' training and clinical judgement 
and undermining their ability to determine the best course of action 
with their patients.'' The American Civil Liberties Union states that 
the bill ``. . . shows a callous disregard for patients in need of 
compassionate, evidence-based care when they face difficult 
decisions.''
  The majority of Americans want more access to reproductive 
healthcare, not less. More than 7 in 10 Americans do not want women to 
lose access to safe, legal abortion. In 1991, a majority of voters in 
the State of Washington passed the Washington Abortion Rights 
Initiative, declaring that a woman has a right to an abortion.
  S. 311 is another misguided attempt to reduce women and families' 
access to reproductive healthcare. I strongly oppose S. 311 and urge my 
colleagues to vote no.",C000127,2019-02-25

picture a baby who has already been born, who is outside the womb, and 
who is gasping for air. That is the only thing that today's vote is 
actually about. We are talking about babies who have already been born. 
Nothing in this bill touches abortion access.

24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 6, 2019, the Senator from 
Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, will now read Washington's Farewell Address.
  Mrs. FISCHER, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:
To the people of the United States:
  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a 
citizen to administer the executive government of the United States 
being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts 
must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with 
that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may 
conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I 
should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline 
being considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to 
be made.
  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that 
this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the 
considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful 
citizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service 
which silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no 
diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful 
respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction 
that the step is compatible with both.
  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which 
your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of 
inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared 
to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much 
earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at 
liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had 
been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, 
previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an 
address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then 
perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and 
the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me 
to abandon the idea.
  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as 
internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible 
with the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever 
partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present 
circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination 
to retire.
  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were 
explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I 
will only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards 
the organization and administration of the government the best 
exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not 
unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, 
experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, 
has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every day the 
increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade 
of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied 
that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, 
they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while 
choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism 
does not forbid it.
  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the 
career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the 
deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved 
country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for 
the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the 
opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable 
attachment by services faithful and


persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have 
resulted to our country from these services, let it always be 
remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals 
that, under circumstances in which the passions agitated in every 
direction were liable to mislead, amidst appearances sometimes dubious, 
vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging, in situations in which not 
unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, 
the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and 
a guarantee of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly 
penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave as a 
strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the 
choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly 
affection may be perpetual; that the free constitution, which is the 
work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration 
in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in 
fine, the happiness of the people of these states, under the auspices 
of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so 
prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of 
recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every 
nation which is yet a stranger to it.
  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, 
which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger 
natural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to 
offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent 
review, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no 
inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the 
permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you 
with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested 
warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive 
to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your 
indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar 
occasion.
  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your 
hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm 
the attachment.
  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now 
dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of 
your real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your 
peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty 
which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from 
different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, 
many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this 
truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which 
the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly 
and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of 
infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of 
your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that 
you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; 
accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of 
your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation 
with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a 
suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly 
frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any 
portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties 
which now link together the various parts.
  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens 
by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to 
concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you 
in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of 
patriotism more than any appellation derived from local 
discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same 
religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a 
common cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and 
liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--
of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.
  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves 
to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more 
immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds 
the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the 
Union of the whole.
  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected 
by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of 
the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial 
enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South 
in the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees 
its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its 
own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular 
navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to 
nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it 
looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself 
is unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, 
already finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior 
communications by land and water will more and more find a valuable 
vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at 
home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth 
and comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must 
of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its 
own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime 
strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble 
community of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West 
can hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own 
separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any 
foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.
  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and 
particular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to 
find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater 
resource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less 
frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is 
of inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from 
those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict 
neighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which 
their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which 
opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate 
and embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those 
overgrown military establishments, which under any form of government 
are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as 
particularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that 
your Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and 
that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the 
other.
  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting 
and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary 
object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common 
government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To 
listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are 
authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the 
auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will 
afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and 
full experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union 
affecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have 
demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to 
distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to 
weaken its bands.
  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as 
matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished 
for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern 
and southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor 
to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local


interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire 
influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions 
and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves too much 
against the jealousies and heart burnings which spring from these 
misrepresentations. They tend to render alien to each other those who 
ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of 
our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. They 
have seen in the negotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous 
ratification by the Senate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the 
universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, a 
decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them 
of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic states 
unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have 
been witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with Great 
Britain and that with Spain, which secure to them everything they could 
desire, in respect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their 
prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of 
these advantages on the Union by which they were procured? Will they 
not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would 
sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?
  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the 
whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts 
can be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the 
infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have 
experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon 
your first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better 
calculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the 
efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the 
offspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full 
investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its 
principles, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with 
energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, 
has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its 
authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are 
duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of 
our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter 
their constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any 
time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the 
whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the 
power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes 
the duty of every individual to obey the established government.
  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and 
associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to 
direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action 
of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental 
principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to 
give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of 
the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but 
artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to 
the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public 
administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects 
of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans 
digested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However 
combinations or associations of the above description may now and then 
answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, 
to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled 
men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for 
themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very 
engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.
  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of 
your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily 
discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but 
also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its 
principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be 
to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will 
impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be 
directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, 
remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true 
character of governments as of other human institutions, that 
experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of 
the existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon 
the credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change 
from the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, 
especially, that for the efficient management of your common interests 
in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is 
consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; 
liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly 
distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else 
than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the 
enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within 
the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure 
and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.
  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, 
with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical 
discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you 
in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of 
party, generally.
  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having 
its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under 
different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, 
or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its 
greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.
  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by 
the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different 
ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is 
itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal 
and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result 
gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the 
absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some 
prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, 
turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the 
ruins of public liberty.
  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which 
nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and 
continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it 
the interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain 
it.
  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the 
public administration. It agitates the community with ill founded 
jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against 
another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door 
to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to 
the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the 
policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will 
of another.
  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks 
upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the 
spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in 
governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, 
if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the 
popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not 
to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will 
always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there 
being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of 
public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, 
it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, 
lest instead of warming it should consume.
  It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free 
country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its 
administration to confine themselves within their respective 
constitutional spheres, avoiding in the


exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The 
spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the 
departments in one and thus to create, whatever the form of government, 
a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power and proneness 
to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to 
satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal 
checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing 
it into different depositories and constituting each the guardian of 
the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by 
experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under 
our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute 
them. If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification 
of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be 
corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. 
But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one 
instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by 
which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly 
overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which 
the use can at any time yield.
  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political 
prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain 
would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to 
subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of 
the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the 
pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not 
trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it 
simply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for 
life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are 
the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with 
caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without 
religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined 
education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both 
forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of 
religious principle.
  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary 
spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less 
force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend 
to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation 
of the fabric?
  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for 
the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a 
government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public 
opinion should be enlightened.
  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public 
credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as 
possible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but 
remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger 
frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding 
likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of 
expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the 
debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously 
throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. 
The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it 
is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to 
them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should 
practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must 
be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can 
be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that 
the intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the 
proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a 
decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the 
government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the 
measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any 
time dictate.
  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace 
and harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and 
can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be 
worthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great 
nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a 
people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can 
doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan 
would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a 
steady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected 
the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at 
least, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. 
Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?
  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that 
permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and 
passionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place 
of them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. 
The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an 
habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its 
animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it 
astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against 
another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay 
hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable 
when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent 
collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, 
prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the 
government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government 
sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through 
passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the 
animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated 
by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace 
often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.
  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another 
produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, 
facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases 
where no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities 
of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels 
and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. 
It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges 
denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the 
concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been 
retained and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to 
retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And 
it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote 
themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the 
interests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with 
popularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of 
obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable 
zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, 
corruption, or infatuation.
  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments 
are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent 
patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic 
factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, 
to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small 
or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the 
satellite of the latter.
  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to 
believe me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be 
constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign 
influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But 
that jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the 
instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense 
against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive 
dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on 
one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on 
the other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, 
are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes 
usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their 
interests.


  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in 
extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little 
political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed 
engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us 
stop.
  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a 
very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent 
controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our 
concerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate 
ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her 
politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships 
or enmities.
  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a 
different course. If we remain one people under an efficient 
government, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury 
from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will 
cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously 
respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making 
acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us 
provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by 
justice shall counsel.
  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own 
to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with 
that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the 
toils of European ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?
  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any 
portion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty 
to do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing 
infidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable 
to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best 
policy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed 
in their genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would 
be unwise to extend them.

  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on 
a respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary 
alliances for extraordinary emergencies.
  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by 
policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should 
hold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting 
exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of 
things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of 
commerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in 
order to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our 
merchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional 
rules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual 
opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time 
abandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; 
constantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for 
disinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of 
its independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that 
by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given 
equivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with 
ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to 
expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an 
illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to 
discard.
  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and 
affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and 
lasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual 
current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course 
which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even 
flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, 
some occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the 
fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign 
intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this 
hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by 
which they have been dictated.
  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by 
the principles which have been delineated, the public records and other 
evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To 
myself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least 
believed myself to be guided by them.
  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of 
the 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your 
approving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of 
Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, 
uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.
  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could 
obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the 
circumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty 
and interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I 
determined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with 
moderation, perseverence, and firmness.
  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is 
not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, 
according to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from 
being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually 
admitted by all.
  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without 
anything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on 
every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain 
inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.
  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be 
referred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant 
motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and 
mature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption 
to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give 
it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.
  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am 
unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my 
defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. 
Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or 
mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me 
the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence 
and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service 
with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be 
consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.
  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by 
that fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in 
it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several 
generations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in 
which I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of 
partaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of 
good laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my 
heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors 
and dangers.
                                                      Geo. Washington.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 525, the Strengthening 
the Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act of 2019. This 
bipartisan bill would authorize the Healthcare Fraud Prevention 
Partnership, and improve and expand the task force's ability to fight 
waste, fraud, and abuse throughout our healthcare system.
  The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership is a public-private 
partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services, 
insurance companies, Federal and State law enforcement agencies, and 
State healthcare agencies. The partnership aims to improve the 
detection and prevention of healthcare fraud by facilitating the 
exchange of data and information between the public and private sectors 
on fraud trends and successful antifraud practices.
  The legislation we are considering today would authorize the 
partnership, require the partnership to report regularly to Congress, 
and give the agency new tools to enhance and expand its capabilities.
  We must continue to work on a bipartisan basis to enhance our fraud 
detection capabilities.
  I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to continue to 
work together to find meaningful solutions to root out fraud, waste, 
and abuse in our healthcare system.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
                                         House of Representatives,


                                  Committee on Ways and Means,

                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2019.
     Hon. Frank Pallone,
     Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Pallone: In recognition of the desire to 
     expedite consideration of H.R. 525, Strengthening the Health 
     Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act of 2019, the Committee 
     on Ways and Means agrees to waive formal consideration of the 
     bill as to provisions that fall within the rule X 
     jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.


       The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the 
     mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction 
     over the subject matter contained in this or similar 
     legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately 
     consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation 
     moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues 
     within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the 
     right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of 
     conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or 
     similar legislation.
       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter 
     confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of 
     our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the 
     Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 525.
           Sincerely,
                                                  Richard E. Neal,

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 525, the Strengthening the 
Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act of 2019, introduced by the 
Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Leader Walden and Chairman 
Pallone.
  This legislation will codify the Healthcare Fraud Prevention 
Partnership, which is currently operated by the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services and is a voluntary public-private partnership 
between the Federal Government, State agencies, law enforcement, 
private health insurance plans, and healthcare antifraud associations.
  The partnership was established by the Obama administration and the 
Trump administration recommended codifying it, solidifying the 
bipartisan nature of revealing and halting scams that cut across public 
and private payers.
  H.R. 525 will ensure the continued operation of this important 
partnership to detect and prevent healthcare fraud through public-
private information sharing, streamlining analytical tools and data, 
and providing a forum for government and industry experts to exchange 
successful antifraud practices.
  This bill before us today is the product of bipartisan cooperation, 
as well as engagement with the Department of Health and Human Services 
and industry stakeholders.
  Originally introduced in the 115th Congress, this legislation worked 
its way through the Committee on Energy and Commerce in a transparent 
manner and currently enjoys the support of the chairmen and republican 
leaders of both the Committee of Energy and Commerce and the Committee 
on Ways and Means.

Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act.
  This bipartisan bill--which I introduced with Chairman Frank Pallone, 
and which is supported by Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal and 
Republican Leader Kevin Brady--is a commonsense, bipartisan bill to 
improve the integrity of our nation's health care system.
  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently 
operates the Health Care Fraud Prevention Partnership--a voluntary 
collaboration between the federal government, state agencies, law 
enforcement, private health insurance plans, and anti-fraud 
associations. Together, this group works to detect and prevent fraud 
that threatens to undermine our nation's health care system. This 
program was created by the Obama Administration, and the Trump 
Administration has recommended codifying it into law. The bill before 
us today does just that.
  Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the House passed this legislation by 
voice vote but unfortunately, we were unable to get this bill through 
the Senate and to the President's desk before the end of the Congress.
  In fact, the House Energy and Commerce Committee had 148 bills pass 
the House last Congress, and 93 percent of them received bipartisan 
votes. I'd like to thank Chairman Pallone for continuing in that 
bipartisan spirit by helping to bring this bill back to the floor 
today.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 501, the Poison Center 
Network Enhancement Act.
  This bill, which I have coauthored with the gentlewoman from Indiana, 
Congresswoman Susan Brooks, reauthorizes for an additional 5 years the 
national network of poison control centers, known as PCCs, which play a 
critical role in the fight to end the opioid crisis.
  Our country's 55 poison centers are staffed by trained toxicologists, 
pharmacists, physicians, and nurses who are available 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week, 365 days a year to provide real-time lifesaving assistance 
via a national toll-free number, which is 1-800-222-1222. Some 330 
million people are served by these critical centers, while handling 2.6 
million cases.
  In 2017, someone called a poison center roughly every 12 seconds in 
our country. More than 90 percent of those calls were due to poison 
exposure in someone's home, and more than half of all cases involved 
children under the age of 12. That is why speedy access to poison 
centers is such an invaluable resource, especially for parents.
  Poison centers also save hundreds of millions in Federal dollars by 
helping to avoid the unnecessary use of medical services and shortening 
the length of time a person spends in the hospital, if hospitalization 
due to poisoning is necessary.
  It is clear that these centers are a smart public health investment, 
but they are also an integral part of our response to the opioid 
epidemic.
  Since 2011, poison centers handled nearly 200 cases per day involving 
opioid misuse. Data from poison centers helped to detect trends in the 
epidemic, and experts helped educate Americans about the crisis in ways 
that could potentially save the lives of their loved ones.
  The Upstate New York Poison Center, for instance, used the New York 
State Fair to educate New Yorkers about proper use of naloxone, the 
overdose reversal drug. This bill would make sure that activities like 
this can continue.
  Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of coauthoring the last poison 
center reauthorization signed into law in 2014, and I am pleased to 
have worked on this important bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Brooks for partnering with me on 
this legislation, as well as Congresswoman DeGette and Congresswoman 
Herrera Beutler for being original cosponsors. Let me also thank 
Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden for their assistance in 
bringing this bill to the floor today.
  As I mentioned earlier, in Westchester County, New York, much of 
which I represent, 124 people died due to opioids in 2016. In the 
Bronx, part of which I also represent, more New Yorkers died of 
overdoses than in any other borough in New York City.
  We must do more to end this epidemic, and I am pleased to see this 
legislation moving forward as part of that effort.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.",E000179,2019-02-25

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support of H.R. 501, 
the Poison Center Network Enhancement Act of 2019, introduced by 
Representatives Brooks and Engel.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my Committee on Energy and Commerce colleagues 
for their bipartisan work on this important initiative.
  This legislation will reauthorize the national toll-free number, 
public awareness campaign, and grant program that supports the Nation's 
55 poison centers.
  These centers are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide 
free and confidential assistance with emergencies and other information 
to help prevent poisoning. As of January 2019, poison control centers 
have managed over 4,000 opioid exposure cases alone.
  At a time when our Nation is still fighting to overcome an opioid 
crisis, these centers are on the front lines, helping to save 
individuals who overdose. Furthermore, these centers collect real-time 
data, enhancing public health surveillance and aiding in the detection 
of public health emergencies.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.",L000566,2019-02-25

Center Network Enhancement Act.
  This important bill, introduced by Reps. Eliot Engel, Susan Brooks, 
Jaime Herrera Beutler, and Diana DeGette, reauthorizes the national 
network of Poison Control Centers.
  The nation's network of poison control centers offers free, 
confidential, and expert medical advice and often serves as the primary 
resource for poisoning information. These centers help reduce Emergency 
Room visits through in-home treatment and their lifesaving assistance 
helps prevent unnecessary poisoning deaths and injuries.
  Poison control centers are also essential to combating the opioid 
crisis because not only are these centers often the first resource 
people seek after an opioid overdose occurs, but they also collect real 
time data to alert impacted communities about opioid abuse and misuse.
  Last Congress, Rep. Brooks led similar legislation, which passed this 
House by voice vote and was then included in the House-passed version 
of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, our broad legislative 
package to combat the opioid crisis. Unfortunately, after negotiations 
with the Senate, this language was not included in the final package 
that was signed into law.
  Therefore, I'd like to commend Rep. Engel and Rep. Brooks for their 
continued leadership on this bipartisan legislation in helping to bring 
this bill to the floor today, and I urge passage.",W000791,2019-02-25

Rare Disease Week.
  Around 350 million people, worldwide, suffer from a rare disease. 
That is more than the number of people who live in the United States, 
alone, and it is particularly alarming when we consider how few 
resources are available to those battling a rare disease.
  In fact, of the 7,000 rare diseases in existence, half of them don't 
have a designated foundation or research support group, and nearly 90 
percent lack an FDA-approved treatment.
  As a member of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, I urge my 
colleagues to support measures that would increase funding for research 
and put our resources into the development and accessibility of 
lifesaving treatments. Treatments should not be as rare as the diseases 
they heal.

friend from Nebraska--I turn the attention of my colleagues to a 
harrowing fact: We are vastly approaching the point where more people 
will have died from exposure to toxic chemicals on 9/11 than were 
killed on 9/11 itself. These are the first responders, firefighters, 
police, and FBI agents who rushed to the towers that fateful day, ran 
into the fire, smoke, and twisted steel, risking their lives and, 
later, we learned, risking their health to get people out. These are 
the union members and construction workers who worked at the pile, 
breathing in a toxic blend of ash and dust in the days and weeks and 
months that followed. These are the people, the innocents, who lived 
downtown when the United States was attacked in the most dastardly 
attack on American soil.
  Right now we have a problem. While these folks are heroes and, sadly, 
many are suffering--because of the alarming number who are suffering 
from 9/11-related illnesses, the victim compensation fund is running 
out of money earlier than expected. The Justice Department recently 
announced that it might have to cut compensation awards between 50 and 
70 percent.
  So today I was proud to join Senators Gillibrand and Gardner, as well 
as a group of our colleagues in the House, to introduce legislation to 
fix the shortfall of funding and put the victims' compensation fund on 
sure footing for the foreseeable future.
  I urge all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to sign 
on and help us pass this bill and give some hope to the thousands who 
were brave on 9/11 and who are suffering now.
  I yield the floor.

1647,HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. JAMES (JIM) LEON STALLINGS,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE207,0,Ms. SEWELL of Alabama,"  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Mr. James (Jim) Leon Stallings of Selma, Alabama.
  Mr. Stallings was beloved by his community and went out of his way to 
improve the lives of others. Sadly, Mr. Stallings passed away on 
Friday, February 15, 2019 at the age of 83.
  As a child, Mr. Stallings attended Nash County Training School in 
Nashville, North Carolina where he stood out as an excellent basketball 
player and athlete.
  After graduating from high school, he attended Allen University in 
Columbia, South Carolina, where he met the love of his life, Bettye 
Bonner.
  Mr. Stallings was drawn to a life of service from a young age. He was 
involved early in life at his church, Mount Vernon Missionary Baptist 
and, upon graduating from college, enrolled in the United States Army.
  Later, Mr. Stallings continued to give back to his community by 
helping develop the next generation of Alabamians, working as a teacher 
in the Wilcox County School System at W. J. Jones High School, in Pine 
Apple, Alabama, and a teacher and basketball coach in the Dallas County 
Schools System at Tipton High School, in Selma, Alabama.
  After many years of service in the Alabama public schools, Mr. 
Stallings transitioned to a role with the City of Selma, dedicating 27 
years as the first African American Director of General Services. In 
that role, Mr. Stallings opened doors of opportunity for many young men 
and women to prosper.
  One of Mr. Stalling's passions was DJing at WHBB Radio in Selma where 
he was fondly known as ``Big Jim.'' He quickly became known for gracing 
the airwaves with a variety of musical genres, including spiritual, 
soft rock and R&B music on his shows, ``The Spiritual Hour'' and the 
``Jim Stallings Show.'' Mr. Stallings' music selections helped heal 
community divisions in the 1960s and laid the pathway for other 
aspiring African American DJs to enter the local radio scene.
  Mr. Stallings' hobbies did not stop at the radio station, though. He 
was an honorary member of the Twelve High Club; a member of the Alabama 
Elks Lodge No. 1170 where he served for several years as the Exalted 
Ruler; an original member of the Tuesday Night Group; Director of the 
local Beauty and Talent; and the Alabama State Association of Elks; 
lead singer for Terry and the Fantastics; and a football announcer for 
the City of Selma and the Dallas County School systems.
  While Mr. Stallings has passed from this life to the next, his legacy 
lives on in his devoted children, Anthony and Bonnie, his five 
grandchildren and many grand nieces and nephews, cousins, other 
relatives and friends.
  On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional district and a grateful 
nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Mr. Stallings' 
contributions to bettering the Selma community and our nation.

commitment of Dr. Derek King, who received the Distinguished Service to 
Education Award from the Victor Valley College Foundation on February 
23, 2019.
  Dr. King currently holds the position of Assistant Superintendent of 
Student Services for Excelsior Charter Schools and has long been 
passionate about education and community service. A proud veteran of 
the U.S. Army, Dr. King began his teaching career with the Department 
of Defense Dependent Schools in Babenhausen Germany as part of the 
Troops to Teachers program. As an educator, Dr. King has served as a 
Teacher, Principal, Assistant Superintendent, Treasurer for the local 
Association of California School Administrators, and member of the 
California State School Attendance and Review Board. Dr. King was also 
elected to the Victor Valley Union High School District Governing 
Board, where he held the positions of Trustee, Clerk and Vice 
President. Dr. King has also been a fixture in our local community, and 
has held positions on the Victorville Military Affairs Committee, the 
Victor Valley Community Service Council, and served as Director and 
Chairman of the Board for the Victor Valley Chamber of Commerce.
  I thank Dr. Derek King for his service to our community and country, 
and his commitment to educating our next generation. With educators 
like Dr. King, our local students will be well-equipped as they make

1649,INTRODUCTION OF THE SAVING AMERICA'S POLLINATORS ACT,CREC-2019-02-25-pt1-PgE206-4,0,Mr. BLUMENAUER,"  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, the peer-reviewed journal Biological 
Conservation recently published a scientific analysis that paints a 
terrifying picture for the future of insects and our planet. This 
analysis concluded that largely because of intensive agriculture, and 
specifically heavy use of pesticides, over 40 percent of insect species 
are threatened with extinction. Furthermore, this analysis found that 
around 41 percent of all insect species have seen their populations 
decline over the last 10 years, and that 3.5 million of the United 
States honeybee colonies have been lost since 1947.
  These alarming statistics foretell a catastrophic collapse of 
nature's ecosystems. Already we are seeing the impacts of the climate 
crisis wreak havoc on our natural world, public health and, 
importantly, our food system. Pollinators and other insects are vital 
to our economy and our livelihoods. One of every three bites of food we 
eat is from a crop pollinated by bees. This analysis is a call to 
action to do all we can to protect these valuable insects, particularly 
in the face of climate change.
  That's why today I am introducing the Saving America's Pollinators 
Act. This legislation will suspend the use of certain insecticides 
until they are thoroughly assessed and determined to be safe for 
pollinators. Furthermore, it establishes a monitoring network for 
native bees, and clarifies the emergency exemption powers that this 
Administration is afforded under current law.
  This law is much needed, and my hope is that with this new and 
alarming information, Congress can finally act to adequately protect 
our future food supply and agricultural and ecological health before 
it's too late.

local acclaim for working to get the Gunnison Tunnel built during his 
time as a District Judge. Judge Gray's son, Joe Gray, was Nick's 
father. Nick grew up on the family ranch his grandfather built with his 
mother Addie Hobson, his father, and the rest of his siblings .
  In 1940, Nick left his family's ranch and volunteered to serve in the 
Army. He was stationed at Pearl Harbor with the 25th Infantry Division 
when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. While overseas he built 
roads and bridges on Guadalcanal in the South Pacific and managed a 
crew of 25 natives who had been bombed out by Japanese forces. After 
his service was complete, he used his military education to build his 
ranching operation back home in Colorado and ultimately created the 
Nick Gray Construction Company.
  As a small business owner, he built more than 3,000 miles of power 
line rights-of-way and roads across three states. In 1963, Nick cleared 
220 miles for power line structure sites, building sub-station sites 
and roads from Wyoming to New Mexico. Another one of Nick's major 
accomplishments was building the Purgatory Ski Area near Durango, 
Colorado. Nick built the parking lot, ski course, and by-pass road all 
the way to Hermosa Park. During the 129-day project, he blasted nearly 
40,000 yards of rock.
  Nick married his wife Margaret in June 1946, and they had a son, 
Stephen Gray. Nick and Margaret have two granddaughters, Nicole Lumsden 
and Lezlee Cox, and six great-grandchildren, Keith Lumsden, Stephen 
Lumsden, Sarah Lumsden, Talli Lumsden, Caralea Cox, and Kendyl Cox.
  Madam Speaker, Nick's service to his country, enduring work-ethic, 
and love of family will continue to have an impact on the Olathe 
community for years to come. It is my privilege to acknowledge him here 
today, and express heartfelt gratitude for the important work he has 
done throughout his life. I wish him all the best in his future.

commitment of Chet Hitt, who received the Distinguished Community 
Service Award from the Victor Valley College Foundation on February 23,

able to purchase four additional mortuaries in the High Desert. Chet

the only Board Member to have been born at that hospital, and also sits 
on the Board for Friends of the Fair for the San Bernardino County 
Fairgrounds. He was named the Apple Valley Chamber of Commerce Citizen 
of the Year in 2002, and was named Service-Based Entrepreneur of the 
Year at the 2017 Spirit of the Entrepreneur Awards for the Inland 
Empire. Chet serves as Chairman of the Board of the Sunset Hills 
Children's Foundation and the Topock 66 Children's Foundation.
  Chet Hitt is one of the most kind, generous, and hard-working people 
in the High Desert, and is eminently deserving of this award. I offer 
my sincere congratulations to Chet on this recognition and my thanks 
for all the outstanding work he does in our community.
