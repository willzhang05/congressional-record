       "\"  Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for Kannon Koser, a \\nconstituent and friend of mine who is with his family in the gallery \\nthis afternoon.\\n  Mr. Speaker, 3-year-old Kannon is one of 4 percent of children in the \\nUnited States who is born with a congenital anomaly--in his case, \\nhypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.\\n  Most health plans provide coverage for congenital anomalies, and many \\nStates require insurers to provide coverage of any health services \\nrelated to congenital anomalies.\\n  Despite this, health plans systematically and routinely deny claims \\nand appeals for any oral or dental related procedures under the \\npretense that such service is merely cosmetic.\\n  That is why Representative Collin Peterson and I have joined together \\nto introduce the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act, a bipartisan bill that \\nwould directly address this issue and ensure that we don't have to tell \\nchildren like Kannon that their health condition isn't valued by \\ninsurance companies.\\n\\n  As the original sponsor on the Republican side, I am proud to put my \\nname on this bill and ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \\nsupport it.\\n  ELSA would ensure all health plans cover medically necessary \\nservices, including reconstructive surgeries that are a result of \\ncongenital anomalies or birth defects.\\n  If enacted, this life-changing bill will allow the Koser family the \\nopportunity to save for Kannon's college rather than spend money on \\nreconstructive surgery.\\n  Commonsense reforms like this will help children like Kannon grow up \\nhealthier and have a better quality of life.\\n  Hi, Kannon. We will see you later, Buddy.\""

Khojaly, which is located in the Nagorno-\\nKarabakh region of Azerbaijan, was once home to 7,000 people. That was \\nbefore Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 unarmed people--\\nincluding 106 women and 83 children--and left less than 2,000 \\nsurvivors. Hundreds more became disabled due to their horrific \\ninjuries. More than one hundred children lost a parent and 25 children \\nlost both parents.

      "Pandas(Index=7, text=\"  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, many of us really appreciate when you \\nstay here and listen to us because we know a lot of folks out there \\ndon't appreciate it. It is sort of a gift of your time to be with us. \\nWhen we were in the majority, I spent much of my freshman term sitting \\nin that chair.\\n  What we are going to do tonight is this sort of a continuation of a \\ntheme. We have already heard tonight, and over the last couple weeks, \\ndiscussions of debt, discussions of what is happening in Medicare, and, \\nactually, I want to come here behind this microphone and talk about \\nwhat I believe is a solution.\\n\\n\\n  I genuinely believe over the last few years, we have put together at \\nleast the backbone of enough math to talk about the reality. But let's \\nfirst sort of set up the discussion if you haven't watched some of our \\nother floor presentations since the beginning of this session.\\n  Every week, every other week, we try to take a half an hour and walk \\nthrough our five pillars of what we believe saves us. Understand, in 9 \\nyears, 50 percent of all of the noninterest spending that this Congress \\nwill do will be to those 65 and over.\\n  Understand, in 9 years, the 74 million baby boomers will actually be \\nin their benefit cycle. They will be 65 and up.\\n  In 9 years, two workers for one retiree. And when you start to look \\nat the future of our debt, understand--and this is hard because so many \\ndon't want to hear it, and it is not Republican or Democrat, it is \\ndemographics. If you look at our society, we are getting older very \\nfast; our birth rates have substantially collapsed. Family formation, \\nwe have some real issues out there.\\n  So what do you do as a society? We have promises that have been made, \\nearned entitlements out there, your Social Security, your Medicare, and \\nyou have earned those. That is part of your societal contract with this \\ngovernment, but we don't have the cash to pay over the next 30 years.\\n  How do we get there? I am going to tell you. I am still optimistic \\nthere is a path. I see some of these slides and these boards through \\nthe eyes of my daughter. I have a 3-year-old daughter. Best little girl \\never. We actually have a coffee mug at home that says that.\\n  Doesn't she have the right to live as well as the generations that \\nhave gone before her? Doesn't she have the right to have that sort of \\noptimistic opportunity? I actually believe that is not lost in our \\nsociety. But as you even saw on the floor today, we do political \\ntheater here because complex policy is hard. It actually requires math, \\nand Congress is substantially a math-free zone.\\n  So we always start with this chart. Understand, I believe there are \\nfive pillars, and you can mix them up any way you want to.\\n  Immigration. How do you design an immigration system in the future \\nthat maximizes talent importation to the Nation? Because you need to \\nmaximize economic philosophy as soon as possible. That is what the rest \\nof the world has done. Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, and \\nCanada have moved to talent-based systems because they figured out that \\nthere is something elegant about that model.\\n  Now, let's be honest. I don't care what gender you are. I don't care \\nyour religion. I don't care your race. I don't care who you cuddle \\nwith. I don't care about those things. We care about the talent you \\nbring to our society to maximize economic growth. I actually think it \\nis a much more elegant model than we use today in immigration.\\n  Economic growth. We must hunker down and embrace tax policy, \\nregulatory policy, and trade policy that maximizes economic vitality. \\nThe velocity of the size of this economy must continue to grow, and \\ngrow at a fairly substantial rate. If you look at the data, 91 percent \\nof the spending increases from this government from 2008 to 2028 are \\nfunctionally three things: interest, Social Security, and healthcare \\nentitlements.\\n  So we are all going to talk about debt. It is a threat to our \\nsociety. When we are going to have the honest conversation, it is \\nsubstantially driven by our demographics and our healthcare costs.\\n  The next one we are going to talk about is labor force participation. \\nWe are going to spend time tonight on that. I know it is a dry subject, \\nbut this is actually trying to be intellectually honest. This is a \\nmoment where if you are going to call our office and say we want \\nsolutions, we are working through it. But it is not trite.\\n  My father used to have a saying. We were just talking about it over \\nin the corner. For every complex problem, there is a simple solution \\nthat is absolutely wrong. It turns out, complex problems require \\ncomplex solutions.\\n  We are going to talk tonight about labor force participation. How do \\nwe get as many Americans across the board to participate in the \\neconomic vitality? It turns out that has an amazing effect; everything \\nfrom our healthcare costs, to tax collections, to just the economic \\ngrowth.\\n  The next two, there is a technology revolution about to happen in \\nhealthcare. It is also happening in environment. In the next couple of \\nweeks we are going to come here and show some of the amazing \\ntechnologies that are out there that actually make some of the \\nenvironmental discussion seem sort of passe when you understand the \\ntechnology that is on the cusp of rolling out.\\n  Let's talk about healthcare right now. I have come here to the floor \\nover the last couple of weeks and shown things like--we nicknamed it in \\nour office the flu kazoo--something a material science professor has \\ndeveloped; you blow into it, and it instantly tells you if you have a \\nviral infection, and in the backbone, it could automatically order your \\nantivirals. Start thinking about the revolution that would happen in \\nthe cost curve of healthcare if we had substantial change in autonomous \\nhealthcare.\\n  In the Phoenix area, we have an organization that now, I believe, has \\nseven of these autonomous healthcare clinics where you go in, you sign \\nup on an iPad, you take a picture of your insurance card, your driver's \\nlicense, you go in and you put your arm in, you pick this up, you shine \\nit in your throat, your ear, and your nose, and the algorithm is able \\nto do amazingly accurate calculations of your health.\\n  Think about that type of technology when it is in your pocket. You \\nhave all seen the pocket size, the size of your\\n\\n\\nsmartphone that is now an ultrasound. It is completely portable. We \\nmust, as a body--and this is at our State legislature, but particularly \\nthis body--we must break down these barriers to the technology \\ndisruption that could be a revolution in lowering healthcare costs.\\n\\n  You have got to be intellectually honest. The ACA, the Republican \\nalternatives, in much of the discussion, we are not actually having a \\ndiscussion about lowering healthcare costs. We are having discussions \\nabout who gets to pay.\\n  It is time that we embrace and truly draw in the technology that can \\nbe that very disruption. We have a running joke in our office: Did you \\ngo to Blockbuster Video last weekend? We all live it. It is now time \\nthat we understand that our future healthcare costs are an Achilles' \\nheel to this society because of our demographics and just where the \\ncosts are going.\\n  There is another part of that. We are going to actually do a floor \\npresentation, probably at the end of the month. There are incredible \\ndisrupters coming in the pharmaceutical world. We just had some \\ninformation and we think, actually by the end of this year, there may \\nbe a single shot cure for hemophilia A. That is only about 8,000 of our \\nbrothers and sisters in the country, and it is going to be really \\nexpensive, but it cures.\\n  What happens as we continue to see these biological, genomic \\npharmaceuticals rolling out that actually cure? Or the one that we were \\nreading about today, that stabilizes our populations who have ALS?\\n  What does that mean to the cost curve of the 50 percent of healthcare \\nspending that is to the 5 percent of our population that have chronic \\nconditions?\\n  The last one I am going to give you is, it is time to rethink the \\nincentives--and this one will always be tough--in Social Security, in \\nMedicare. How do we encourage an individual to stay in the labor force? \\nAre there things we can do to encourage waiting to take benefits? And \\nthese are math. It is just actuarial science.\\n  So today we are going to talk about labor force participation. Isn't \\nthat exciting? The first slide I have already mentioned, this is from \\nthe CBO report 3 weeks ago, and I was shocked it didn't get much press \\nor discussion in this body because it is math.\\n  But if you look at this chart, what it is trying to say is, in \\nfunctionally 9 years, half of the spending of this body--if you remove \\ninterest--half of the spending will be to those 65 and older.\\n  It is just demographics. We got older as a society. In 9 years it is \\nthe end of the baby boomers, because they have moved into being 65 and \\nolder.\\n  But if you had seen this chart and then matched it up to where you \\nstart to see the debt and spending curves move up, you understand they \\nare in sync: if you care about the debt, if you care about spending, if \\nyou care about opportunity in our society, understand the demographic \\nheadwinds and what we must do to face that.\\n  So one of the reasons for this slide, and I know these are a little \\ntough to watch, but what I want you to sort of see is this is 2000. At \\nthat time, actually over 67 percent of our population was in the labor \\nforce. It functionally collapsed after 2008 and never returned.\\n  The blessing is this last year we have had a little bit of a blip. \\nThere were these really smart economists who said: Hey, you are never \\ngoing to get back up to 62, 63 percent of labor force participation. I \\nbelieve we are now around 61 or 62. We actually need to find a way to \\nget back to that 67 percent of our brothers and sisters all up and down \\nour society being in the labor force, having the honor, the elegance of \\nworking.\\n  There were some amazing numbers last December, if you actually broke \\ninto what was in those statistics, of the number of organizations, the \\nnumber of companies that were actually reaching out to the handicapped \\ncommunity and making accommodations and hiring.\\n  There are actually--and we are going to touch on this--some parts of \\nour society are moving into the labor force, particularly in the \\nmillennials, and we are seeing parts that are not. Countries like Japan \\nthat actually have faced this, are facing it, have actually been trying \\nto design incentives and programs for even those who are older, who are \\nhealthy, who are capable, who are desirous to be welcomed to stay or \\nenter back into the labor force.\\n  It is a barbell. We have a problem with part of our younger \\npopulation, and then, obviously, our older population--which we have so \\nmuch talent--that are retiring. We are going to have to have an honest \\nincentives discussion design to maintain this labor force philosophy.\\n  If you actually look at what is going on in our society right now, if \\nI had come to you 2 years ago and said: Hey, we are going to see all \\nsorts of quartiles in our society have some of the lowest unemployment \\nin modern history, I think I would have just gotten blank stares. But \\nit is happening. And with that incredible, almost full-employment \\nsociety, we are actually seeing--and particularly in markets like \\nArizona--we are actually now seeing wages really starting to move. This \\nis wonderful. This is something we needed, functionally, for a decade \\nor two.\\n  We can do a much more complicated discussion of some of the \\nincentives that were built in the tax reform last year that encouraged \\ninvestment in plant and equipment to push up productivity. Productivity \\nallows you to be able to pay people more. But those are the sorts of \\nthings you talk about. How do you maintain economic vitality?\\n  When we actually look at some of the unemployment numbers, there is \\nsomething missing. Understand, when we look at unemployment numbers, we \\nare looking at people who are actively looking, actively searching for \\nemployment. We actually have a real problem in parts of millennial \\nmales and others, so how do we reach out and design incentives to stay \\nin?\\n  We are also going to go to some of the other tougher questions, and \\nthat is: Is it time to rethink things like Social Security disability \\nand say, hey, if you earn $24,000, or you hit this point, you hit a \\ncliff. Your benefits disappear. If you are on other safety-net \\nprograms, if you earn a certain amount, you hit a cliff, and it \\ndisappears.\\n  We need to have a brutally honest conversation of, is that incentive \\nof that cliff an incentive not to enter the labor force? What would \\nhappen if we would work out the math so it was a much more gradual \\nglide slope to draw those individuals into labor participation? Because \\nif we are almost a full-employment society but we still had millions \\nand millions of Americans who are choosing not to participate in the \\neconomy and we really need them in our economy, we have got to look to \\nwhat are the disincentives.\\n\\n\\n  It is about time that we actually start to have those social \\nentitlement conversations. I know for both Republicans and Democrats, \\nthese are tough because it requires math. It requires us to work \\nthrough certain ideological folklore. But if you want the wholistic \\nsolution to make it through the next 30 years, this labor force \\nparticipation is one of those five pillars.\\n  The reason I actually did this slide is--this one is a little geeky--\\nbut it is actually trying to walk through what has been happening. I am \\nnot going to walk through all the detail, but we recently had this \\nwonderful pop of sort of in the population of 25 to 34 females entering \\nthe workforce. That was one of the great things that we actually saw \\nlast December. Great.\\n  We need to understand why millennial women are entering the workforce \\nin these sorts of numbers, what we learn from that, and what we do now \\nfor the millions of millennial males who are still dramatically \\nunderrepresented in the economy.\\n  Data shows millennial women dominating the current job market. Look \\nat this separation right here and why this is so important. Remember \\nhow I was just saying something has been happening in the last couple \\nquarters where millennial females are entering, but millennial males is \\nthe lower line. This is a conceptual problem, but it is real math.\\n  Remember we talked about our barbell? We have those who are older. \\nHow do we create incentives to enter and stay in the labor force? How \\ndo we reach out to our younger population, get them, incentivize them, \\nand work with them to get them into the labor force? Functionally, we \\njust do not have a choice.\\n\\n\\n  Let me grab another slide. We will put these up in our office. \\nRemember, this sort of presentation is for those who really care about \\ndigging in to the actual math of policy. So often, what we end up doing \\non the floor is political theater and folklore.\\n  If you look at some of these lines--and I know this is a long time \\nago--but if you and I were to step back to 1967 and look at the data \\nfor males, we had 97 percent of working-age males in the labor force. \\nToday, if we did that same thing, I think we are at about 88. It falls, \\n87, 88.\\n  One of the big things that helped us grow the economy is female \\nparticipation in the economy. But we need to find a way to get this \\nback up. We are just talking a few points, but those few points of a \\nfew more million stepping back into the labor market have substantial \\neconomic impact.\\n  I want to talk about a story from Arizona. I have had this discussion \\nwith a couple of my Democratic friends. Within that, we have talked \\nabout incarceration rates and some of the other things that end up \\nbecoming impairments for young males to be in the labor force.\\n  In Arizona right now, we have such a shortage of skilled trades--\\nelectricians and carpenters--that a number of the businesses in \\nArizona--actually, I approached our Governor, Governor Ducey, and said: \\nHelp us. We are willing to take our own money and go into Arizona \\ncorrectional facilities and do a training program that is, when someone \\nis going to be on parole in just a few months, we will train them, and \\nwe will guarantee that we will hire them. It doesn't mean a guarantee \\nthat they will keep them.\\n  So last year, we brought this young man out from Arizona. We brought \\nhim to the Ways and Means Committee. He sat down in this beautiful \\nroom. The Ways and Means Committee room, it is just very big and very \\nornate. He didn't look like our typical witness, with a number of \\npiercings and a number of tattoos around the neck. He looked up when it \\nwas his turn to tell his story, and he hesitated for a moment and \\nstarted with: I am a three-time convicted felon.\\n  He went on to tell his story of how he was an addict and the other \\ntimes he had gotten out of prison, he had relapsed. He had lost his \\nfamily. He had lost everything. He had lost contact with his child.\\n  He was a few months from his opportunity to go on probation and leave \\nthe correctional facility, and he saw this flyer that said: We are \\ndoing training for electricians. We guarantee we will hire you--it \\ndoesn't mean we are going to keep you--if you pass this very basic \\ncourse.\\n  He said: Why not?\\n  He took this electrician course while in prison, while it was paid \\nfor by private industry because the job market is so tight they are \\nwilling to take risks on all sorts of populations to get them back into \\nthe work environment.\\n  He graduated. He started at just a little over minimum wage. A year \\nlater, he was making, I think, $23-something an hour. He said he hadn't \\nrelapsed because he is working too much. He said he is back with his \\nfamily. He gets to see his child. There are these incredibly human \\nstories.\\n  If we are in a society right now that is almost at full employment \\nfor those looking for employment, how do we reach out to those whom our \\nsociety gave up on or who gave up on themselves? How do we as \\npolicymakers design those incentives, design the social entitlement \\nprograms, and design our society where we want everyone to have this \\nopportunity within our communities and our society?\\n  It was one of the most touching and amazing hearings, because when \\nyou looked at those of us sitting up on the dais, there were actually \\ntears hearing his story and realizing there is hope, that this economic \\nvitality provides opportunity and hope.\\n  We turn it into a political football because it is not our side that \\nwants to get credit, or their side wants to get credit. We need to get \\nbeyond that, because if we don't get this math right, my 3-year-old \\nlittle girl won't have the same type of future I have had.\\n  There is a path to make this work and continue to have an economy, a \\nnation, that grows and provides opportunities. Understand, when the \\nUnited States grows, the world benefits.\\n  But we have those five pillars. Is this body capable of stepping up \\nand doing things that are complex without a simple solution?\\n  Madam Speaker, I so desperately hope so. With that, I yield back the \\nbalance of my time.\\n\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Social Security & Tax Reform', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",

That is why I worked with my colleagues on both sides \\nof the aisle last year on a measure which is now law to increase \\nsecurity for our kids in the schools. But the gun control bill being \\nconsidered this week makes it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend \\nthemselves and others against criminals who have guns.\\n  We need to enforce the laws already on the books, not limit the \\nrights of law-abiding citizens who want to protect their families.\\n\", cat_list={'Gun Control', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=25, text=\"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today, the House of Representatives \\nwill take up a motion to terminate the state of emergency proclaimed by \\nPresident Trump. For many reasons, the measure should pass with \\nbipartisan support.\\n  First, Members of both parties know there is no actual emergency at \\nthe border. Nearly 60 former national security advisers--Democrat and \\nRepublican, bipartisan--including former Secretaries of State and \\nDefense, have written a statement saying there is ``no factual evidence \\nof an emergency at the border.'' The President himself said, when \\nannouncing the state of emergency, that he ``didn't need to do this.''\\n  An emergency, by definition, is something you need to do. It is an \\nemergency. In the President's own words, this is not a state of \\nemergency.\\n  If we let Presidents, whomever they be--Democrat or Republican--\\nwilly-nilly, because they want to get something done, just declare an \\nemergency when it is clear it has been a long-term\\n\\n\\ncondition, a long-term issue, this country is a different country.\\n  That leads to my second point. Members of both parties should be \\nconcerned about the President diverting money away from military \\nconstruction projects in their districts.\\n  Again, the President doesn't like you for some reason. He says there \\nis an emergency and takes money away from a project in your State that \\nyou have worked hard for. That is no way to govern.\\n  But at the top of the list is this: the Founding Fathers looking down \\nupon this Chamber and upon these United States of America. They set up \\nan exquisite balance of power. They were worried about an overreaching \\nExecutive. They knew what King George was all about. So they named the \\nCongress, the House and Senate, the article I--article I, not II, III \\nor IV--part of the government. Second, they gave the Congress one of \\nthe greatest powers any government has, which is the power of the \\npurse.\\n  When the President tries to take these powers away, which clearly he \\nis doing in this case--he called for an emergency when he couldn't get \\nhis way in Congress, not because some new facts came on the scene--it \\nis a change in the fundamental, necessary, and, often, exquisite \\nbalance of power.\\n  I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle understand \\nthat. In fact, true conservatism worries about too much power being \\ncentralized in any place because conservatism exalts the freedom of the \\nindividual.\\n  So to look the other way because Donald Trump wants this--because he \\nis almost sometimes in a temper tantrum about this issue--is so short-\\nsighted and is so detrimental to the long-term health, stability, and \\nviability, even, of how the balance of power works.\\n  So I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to contemplate \\nwhat it might portend for our democracy to allow this emergency \\ndeclaration to stand. What would stop any future President from \\nclaiming an emergency every week and doing what they wanted--a total \\nsubversion of the balance of powers, a derogation of huge power to the \\nExecutive, which has plenty of power already?\\n  The National Emergencies Act has been used only once in its \\nrelatively short history, and that was to take action after 9/11--\\nclearly, an emergency. Now President Trump is trying to bend the law to \\nhis will, not to address a military emergency, not to address any real \\nemergency. This has been an ongoing issue. He would say ``problem.'' \\nThat is OK, but he is doing it for personal political gain, to \\naccomplish something Congress rejected and the American people oppose.\\n  He has tried several times to get this wall. Congress has resisted. \\nCongress even resisted when Democrats didn't have control of the House, \\nand now they do. Elections do matter. We are a democracy, President \\nTrump. So it is hard to imagine a more senseless and destructive use of \\nemergency powers than what the President has proposed.\\n  So let us, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, rise to the \\noccasion. This will be a moment in history, a point where things may \\nturn a bit. If Congress stands up, it will be a reaffirmation of our \\ndemocracy. It will be a reaffirmation of the democracy the Founding \\nFathers wanted. If Congress stands up--Democrats and Republicans--when \\nthe Founding Fathers look down on this Chamber after the vote occurs, \\nthey will smile because this is the democracy they wanted. They did not \\nwant a democracy where a President could simply declare an emergency on \\na whim and overrule what Congress has done.\\n  So let us--Congress--first the House and then the Senate, speak up \\nwith one bipartisan voice to remedy this injury that President Trump is \\ntrying to do to our constitutional order.\\n  Whatever you think of the best way to secure our border, this is not \\nthe way for a President--any President--to exercise his authority. This \\nis not about whether you are for or against a wall, and I, of course, \\nam against it. It is about what America is all about, whatever your \\nview on the wall.\\n\\n\\n                                  Guns\\n\\n  Madam President, on guns, the House this week will take up a measure \\nto close the dangerous loopholes in the background check system used to \\ncertify firearms. For years, Democrats have tried to address these \\nloopholes--the gun show, online, and private sales loopholes--only to \\nbe met with lockstep resistance by a Republican Congress beholden to \\nthe NRA. It is 90 percent of Americans who favor strengthening the \\nbackground check system, not 51, not 52, 90--the majority of \\nRepublicans, the majority of gun owners. Any way you slice it, \\nAmericans are strengthening background checks. Americans believe \\nfelons, spousal abusers, or those adjudicated mentally ill should not \\nhave guns, but Congress is paralyzed because of the other side's \\nobeisance to the NRA--not even after Newtown, not even after \\nCharleston, not even after Las Vegas, not even after Orlando, not after \\nParkland.\\n  On guns, the tide is turning. Make no mistake about it, a strong \\nmajority of the American people support these policies now. The NRA has \\nbeen considerably weakened. They did not do very well in the last \\nelections. Finally, there is a House in Congress that will listen to \\nthe American people and take action on guns--thoughtful, moderate \\naction on background checks.\\n  With each measure that passes the House, the pressure will build on \\nthe Senate to take up these reasonable, commonsense gun safety \\nmeasures, and I hope my colleagues will join us.\\n\\n\\n                                Buybacks\\n\\n  On another matter, buybacks. This morning, the New York Times \\nreported on an interesting facet of the recent stock market rally. Many \\ninvestors, according to the Times, are selling off stock. Average \\ninvestors are selling off stock. Pensions, and mutual funds, \\nnonprofits, endowments, private equity firms, and trusts are all, in \\nthe aggregate, selling stock.\\n  So then why is it rallying? The laws of supply and demand should say \\nthe stock market should go down. The Times reports that it is corporate \\nself-investment buybacks. Companies are buying back their own stock at \\nsuch a rapid clip that they are propping up the market and, to a great \\ndegree, themselves. It is another clear example of how the recent \\nexplosion of stock buybacks in corporate America is distorting the \\nmarket--artificially, some would argue.\\n  Some Democratic Senators, and even some Republican Senators, have \\nbegun to sound the alarm about the recordbreaking scale of corporate \\nbuybacks. Over the last decade, based on analysis of America's largest \\ncorporations, 466 of S&P 500 companies, 92 cents out of every dollar of \\ncorporate profit has gone to share buybacks or dividends.\\n  Some say, well, they have already, before the profits, put money into \\ntheir workers and into their communities. We are saying they should put \\nsome more, for the good of the country. Stock price, when so much of it \\nis held up by buybacks, shouldn't be the only indicia, the only \\nmeasure, of how well the country is doing, especially when 85 percent \\nof the stocks are owned by the top 10 percent of Americans.\\n  Most Americans would completely agree that there are more productive \\nways for corporations to allocate their capital than this borderline \\nobsession with stock buybacks--the slavery to short-term rises in price \\nto please investors--while not doing much for workers or for \\ncommunities.\\n  I hope corporate America will wake up. Income inequality, along with \\nclimate change, to me, are the two greatest problems America faces. We \\nneed corporate America to propose some solutions because when they say \\nlet government do it, much of corporate America then opposes government \\ndoing anything for workers or for communities.\\n  Let's take a careful look at this, and let's see what the right \\nsolutions are. The status quo is not acceptable.\\n\\n\\n                             Climate Change\\n\\n  Madam President, on climate change, for decades we have known climate \\nchange is not only a major national challenge but an existential threat \\nto our planet and to our future. Despite the gravity and scale of this \\nchallenge, one political party in the United States has largely denied \\nthe problem even exists, denied the overwhelming consensus of the \\nscientific community, and denied most attempts in Congress to tackle \\nclimate change.\\n  President Trump's record on climate change is one of abject failure: \\ndenying science, systematically rolling back environmental protections \\nthat reduce\\n\\n\\ncarbon emissions, and announcing withdrawal from the Paris climate \\naccords--Luddite, ostrich-like, if there ever were, actions that can be \\ndescribed that way.\\n  Recently, we heard of a new effort by the Trump administration to \\nonce again push back against efforts to address climate change. You \\nsee, it was probably embarrassing for President Trump when his own \\nadministration released the National Climate Assessment last year, as \\nrequired by law, which outlined the severe and immediate impacts of \\nclimate change. According to reports, the White House now has plans to \\nset up a fake panel of cherry-picked scientists who question the \\nseverity of climate change in order to counter the scientific consensus \\non this terribly urgent problem, even within the administration. This \\nnew fake panel will reportedly be set up under the National Security \\nCouncil, not the EPA, not NOAA, or any of the Agencies where real \\nscientists work--real climate scientists.\\n  This is maybe the most conspicuous symptom of the disease of climate \\ndenialism that has infected the Republican Party and the hard right. \\nThis is beyond willful ignorance. This is the intentional, deliberate \\nsowing of disinformation about climate science by our own government. \\nThis cannot stand.\\n  This morning, I am announcing that if the Trump administration moves \\nforward with this fake climate panel, we will be introducing \\nlegislation to defund it. I will be doing it, along with several of my \\ncolleagues. It is long past time for President Trump and Republican \\nleaders to admit that climate change is real, that human activity \\ncontributes to it, and Congress must take action to counter it.\\n  So far, Leader McConnell and our Republicans, when we ask them, do \\nyou believe climate change is real? Silence. Do you believe humans \\ncause it? Silence. Do you believe Congress has to act to deal with it? \\nSilence. That will not stand, and they will not be able to maintain \\nthat position over a period of time.\\n\\n\\n                              North Korea\\n\\n  Madam President, finally, on North Korea--and I appreciate the \\nindulgence of my friend from Illinois. There are a lot of topics and a \\nlot of things going on today.\\n  As the President continues negotiations in Hanoi with the North \\nKoreans, I want to restate that his goal should be complete, \\nverifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of Korea. An agreement \\nthat includes significant U.S. sanctions relief in exchange for \\nsomething short of that will be woefully insufficient. It will make \\nNorth Korea stronger and the world more dangerous, not safer.\\n  To simply say to North Korea that we are going to let you continue to \\nbe nuclear in exchange for something else--a peace treaty or some \\nwords, a photo op--that is not protecting the security of the United \\nStates.\\n  I remind my colleagues, Congress passed sanctions against the North \\nKorean regime for its appalling record on human rights. Congress would \\nneed to repeal that law for President Trump to give North Korea \\nreliable sanctions relief.\\n  The North Koreans themselves should realize many of us in Congress \\nwill not, will not, will not--no matter what President Trump does, many \\nof us in Congress will not remove this sanction relief until North \\nKorea denuclearizes, verifiably and irreversibly.\\n  Make no mistake about it, no matter what President Trump does in \\nVietnam this week, this Chamber will have a significant role to play if \\nPresident Trump decides to reduce sanctions as part of any deal with \\nNorth Korea.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=27, text=\"  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last night, for the second time in a \\nmonth, Democrats objected to a bill to ban infanticide.\\n  That statement to me is absolutely chilling, but for the second time \\nin a month, Democrats objected to a bill that would do nothing more \\nthan state that a living, breathing baby born in an abortion clinic is \\nentitled to the same protection and medical care as a living, breathing \\nbaby born in a hospital is entitled to.\\n  It is a pretty basic bill. It just says that living, breathing, born \\nhuman beings are entitled to protection even if they are born in an \\nabortion clinic, but apparently that is not something Democrats are \\nprepared to say. This is where Democrats' support for abortions has led \\nthem--to being unable to condemn infanticide.\\n  Let's remember why we voted on this bill last night. We voted on this \\nbill because the Democratic Governor of Virginia implicitly endorsed \\ninfanticide--because the Democratic Governor of Virginia got up and \\nsaid that you could keep a living, breathing baby comfortable while you \\ndecided what to do with it.\\n  There is only one answer to what you do with a living, breathing \\nbaby, and that is to provide it with the care it needs. A baby born \\nalive in an abortion clinic is no less valuable and deserving of \\nprotection than a baby born in a delivery room.\\n  It is horrifying that we are actually having a debate about this. \\nHonestly, it is horrifying that the Democratic Party can't get up and \\nsay that infanticide is wrong. My Democratic colleagues like to talk \\nabout protecting the vulnerable, but how can they claim to care about \\nhelping those in need if they harden their hearts toward the most \\nvulnerable among us? If they are willing to deny living, breathing \\nbabies basic medical care, do you really stand for the vulnerable if \\nyou can't stand up and say that infanticide is wrong?\\n  It is terrible enough that we have so far betrayed our founding \\nprinciples as to deny the right to life of living, breathing unborn \\nbabies, but we are not even talking about abortion here. We are talking \\nabout withholding essential care from babies who are born alive. My \\nDemocratic colleagues can't even bring themselves to say this is wrong.\\n  I would say to my Democratic colleagues, do you really want to be the \\nparty of Governor Northam? Do you really want to be the party of \\ninfanticide?\\n  The American people don't agree with the Democratic Party on abortion \\nand on infanticide. Most Americans believe that babies born alive after \\nan abortion should be provided with medical care. Most Americans think \\nthere should be at least some limits on abortion. In fact, most \\ncountries in the world think there should be some limits on abortion. \\nThe United States is just one of a tiny handful of countries that allow \\nelective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. Among the others on that \\nlist are China and North Korea--not exactly the company we want to be \\nkeeping when it comes to protecting human rights.\\n  A recent poll found that 71 percent of Americans oppose abortion \\nafter 20 weeks of pregnancy. Yet the Democratic Party is aggressively \\nembracing an agenda of zero restrictions on abortion, ever, up to--and \\nnow, apparently, after--the moment of birth.\\n  I hope last night is not the last time we vote on the Born-Alive \\nAbortion Survivors Protection Act. I hope my Democratic colleagues have \\na chance to recast their votes. I hope, next time, they will decide to \\nvote against infanticide. I hope, next time, they can affirm what \\nshould be a basic, foundational principle, and that is that every baby, \\nwherever he or she is born, deserves to be protected.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

I would like to make a suggestion.\\n  Since the Republicans are in control of the U.S. Senate, since there \\nis a Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would \\nsuggest to my colleague that perhaps we have a hearing on this bill he \\njust described. You see, it came to the floor yesterday without any \\nhearing. And the reason why we need a hearing is that many of us--many \\nof us--voted for an infanticide law, which is currently on the books--a \\nlaw that says that a child needs to be protected and that those who \\ndon't protect that child are subject to criminal penalties, as they \\nshould be.\\n\\n  Now, if this is a different approach to it, doesn't it at least merit \\na hearing from the Republican majority before it comes to the floor for \\na vote? There are many questions I would like to ask of those who \\npropose this. I want to understand why the law that has been on\\n\\n\\nthe books now for 17 years, as I remember, is inadequate to the \\nchallenges it faces.\\n  I supported the infanticide law. I will continue to. If there are any \\nchanges that the Republicans want to make, is it too much to ask them \\nto have a hearing in their own committee, which they chair, on this \\nsubject matter?

Eleven days ago, on Friday, \\nFebruary 15, an angry man with a history of violence and a Smith & \\nWesson .40 caliber pistol opened fire on his coworkers and police \\nofficers at a warehouse in Aurora, IL, about 40 miles from the city of \\nChicago.\\n  In a matter of just a few minutes, five of this man's coworkers at \\nthe Henry Pratt Company were dead. He then shot and wounded five police \\nofficers who rushed to the scene. An hour and a half later, he died in \\nan exchange of gunfire with other policemen.\\n  The day before this horrible incident marked the anniversary of two \\nother mass shootings: the 1-year anniversary of the Parkland, FL, \\nshooting, which killed 17 high school students and staff, and the 11-\\nyear anniversary of a shooting at Northern Illinois University that \\nleft 5 students dead and 17 injured.\\n  The gunman in the Henry Pratt warehouse massacre had just been told \\nthat day that he was going to be fired. His response was not just \\nanger. His response was to pull out a firearm and murder five of his \\ncoworkers.\\n  I want you to meet the victims of this man's violence. This is Trevor \\nWehner. Trevor was 21 years old. He was on the dean's list of Northern \\nIllinois University's business college. He was on track to graduate \\nthis May.\\n  Why was he at the Henry Pratt warehouse on that day? It was because \\nhe was on his first day of an internship at the business. Trevor was so \\nexcited about this opportunity to work at this business and to see what \\nit was like to actually be in the real world that he showed up for his \\ninternship 45 minutes early that day. It was earlier than he should \\nhave. He was that excited. He died at the workplace that day.\\n  This is Clayton Parks. He was known as ``Clay'' to his family and \\nfriends. He was the human resources manager at Henry Pratt. He was also \\nan alumnus of Northern Illinois University. He had been working at the \\nHenry Pratt Company for 4 months. He was 32 years old. He was married \\nto his wife Abby and had a beautiful little 9-month-old baby boy, Axel.\\n  I met them at Northern Illinois University when we held a vigil for \\nTrevor and Clay that afternoon. I talked to Clay's mom for the longest \\ntime. She wanted to tell me his whole life story, hoping that she could \\npreserve the memory of this wonderful young man and what he meant to \\nher.\\n  Russell Beyer is over here. I went to his memorial service. He had \\nbeen at Henry Pratt for more than 25 years. He was a mold operator and \\nwas the father of two grown children. He was also the chairman of the \\nunion at Henry Pratt.\\n  In a terrible twist of fate, Russell had helped the gunman get his \\njob back when the company first fired him 2 months earlier. Last \\nThursday would have been Russell's 48th birthday. Instead of a birthday \\nparty, his family and friends gathered that day at his wake. As I went \\ninto the funeral home in Montgomery, IL, I was struck by this fact. It \\nturns out that the family decided that since Russell was such a \\npassionate football fan, everybody should wear NFL jerseys. The room \\nwas filled with members of his family remembering him and paying \\ntribute to him by wearing jerseys of all of the different teams they \\nsupported. Russell was a Patriots fan. He wore a Patriots jersey in his \\ncasket on the day that would have been his 48th birthday.\\n  Vicente Juarez was a stockroom attendant and a forklift operator. He \\nhad been at Henry Pratt for 13 years, since the year 2006. Mr. Juarez \\nand his wife of 38 years lived in a home in Oswego with their three \\ngrown children and eight grandchildren--all under one roof.\\n  I will not forget that scene at the funeral home, either, because the \\nfamily had decided that everyone would wear a T-shirt. It was a black \\nT-shirt with a color photograph of Vicente in front of it and one of \\nhis favorite sayings on the back of it. There they were--grandchildren, \\nchildren, older folks--all wearing those black T-shirts in honor and \\nmemory of this man.\\n\\n  I met his sister. His sister told me a story that Vicente was part of \\nthe family who immigrated to Illinois in 1972. There were five boys and \\nfive girls. They didn't have any money. Their father died 6 years after \\nthey immigrated. Yet they struggled and worked and stuck together as a \\nfamily. That beautiful family--that beautiful family--had to shoulder \\nthis tragedy, where this gunman walked into that warehouse and killed \\nVicente.\\n  Josh Pinkard's photograph is here. He was the plant manager. He \\njoined Henry Pratt's parent company 13 years ago at a facility in his \\nnative Alabama. He and his wife had moved to Illinois with their three \\nlittle kids last spring. As he lay dying, Josh pulled out his cell \\nphone and texted his wife. His message was this: ``I love you. I've \\nbeen shot at work.'' He died shortly thereafter. Josh Pinkard was 37 \\nyears old.\\n  How did the police respond to this mass shooting? Every on-duty \\nmember of the Aurora Police Department rushed to the scene, where they \\nwere joined quickly by off-duty members of the police department. Then, \\nonce the word got out that a policeman had been injured, hundreds of \\nother policemen, firefighters, and other first responders all came to \\nthe scene.\\n  I was on the phone with the Aurora police chief, Kristen Ziman. \\nKristen put out a statement, which I commended her for. It was the most \\neloquent statement. It said many things, but I want to repeat what it \\nsaid. She said: ``Every time an officer was hit, another one went in. \\nNo one retreated.''\\n  All told, five members of the Aurora Police Department were injured \\nby gunfire: Officer Adam Miller, Officer Marco Gomez, Officer John \\nCebulski, Officer James Zegar, and Officer Reynaldo Rivera. A sixth \\nofficer, Diego Avila, suffered a knee injury. They and hundreds of \\nother police officers and first responders who rushed to the scene are \\nheroes. Simply put, they are heroes. Their quick and courageous \\nresponse certainly saved other lives.\\n  Here is the cruel irony and tragedy beyond the loss of life. The \\ngunman should never have had a begun. In 1995, this gunman pleaded \\nguilty in the State of Mississippi to charges that he had beaten a \\nformer girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbed her with a knife. He \\nwas sentenced to 5 years in prison. He served 3.\\n  In January of 2014--19 years later--he applied for an Illinois \\nfirearm owner's identification card. He lied on that application. He \\nsaid he had no felony record, and he was given permission under \\nIllinois law to buy a firearm. He got away with that lie because the \\nState of Mississippi had failed to submit his conviction record to the \\nFBI's criminal background check system. He wasn't in the computer as \\nbeing disqualified.\\n  In March 2014, this man bought a handgun from a gun dealer in Aurora. \\nTwo weeks later, he applied for a concealed carry permit. This time he \\nslipped up. He voluntarily submitted his fingerprints in the hopes that \\nhis concealed carry permit would be expedited. Those fingerprints \\nfinally exposed his felony record in Mississippi and his violent past.\\n  The Illinois State Police got word of it, rejected his concealed \\ncarry application, revoked his firearm owner's identification card, and \\nsent him a letter saying that he needed to surrender the Smith & Wesson \\nfirearm, which he used to kill these five innocent people and to injure \\nthese policemen. Obviously, he never surrendered the weapon. It was \\nthat same weapon that he used to kill these innocent people and to \\ninjure these policemen.\\n  Almost 7 years ago, a disturbed young man opened fire in a movie \\ntheater in a suburb of Denver, killing 12 people and injuring 70 \\nothers. The name of that suburb was Aurora--Aurora, CO.\\n  In a sad commentary on how frequent mass shootings have become in \\nthis great Nation, the police chief of\\n\\n\\nAurora, CO, tweeted after the killings in Aurora, IL: ``Months from \\nnow, as people talk about the mass shooting in Aurora, someone will \\nask, ``Which Aurora mass shooting are you talking about?''\\n  Mass shootings have become too common in America. They make the news, \\nbut tens of thousands of Americans die every year from gun violence, \\nand many of those deaths are barely reported or noted. They die in \\nsuicides and gun accidents, alone or in small groups, in domestic \\ndisturbances, in gang disputes, and in crossfire.\\n  I am honored to represent the city of Chicago, but my heart breaks to \\nknow that last year more than 2,700 people were injured or killed by \\ngun violence in that great city.\\n  Let's face it, America is confronting an epidemic of gun violence. We \\nneed thoughts and prayers, but we need so much more. We need action to \\ndo something.\\n  Do the lives of these policemen mean anything? Of course, they do. \\nThey mean a great deal to their families, and they mean a great deal to \\nthis Nation.\\n  Do the lives of these victims who died mean anything? I met the \\nfamilies--four of them. They are heartbroken, and their lives will \\nnever be the same.\\n  We need action to close the deadly gaps in America's gun background \\ncheck system. Much of the work needs to take place at the State level. \\nState and local law enforcement agencies are investigating how this \\ntragedy might have been prevented and how to prevent another violent \\nfelon from slipping through the cracks in the system.\\n  We also have a responsibility here. It is not enough for a moment of \\nsilence. It is not enough for prayers to be offered. We need to do more \\nto keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\\n  This week, the House of Representatives will vote on a measure to \\nclose the gun show and internet loopholes in our background check \\nsystem. These loopholes make a mockery of the law, which says we want \\nto make sure that no dangerous person buys a firearm or keeps a firearm \\nin America. It is critically important, and I support the House's \\neffort, but, sadly, I have to predict that this measure will not even \\ncome up for a debate--let alone a vote--in this Republican-controlled \\nSenate. There is just no way that they will consider any gun safety \\nmeasure.\\n  After Columbine and nearly every mass shooting and natural disaster \\nsince, a carpenter who lives in Illinois has crafted wooden memorials \\nto honor the fallen.\\n  His name is Greg Zanis, 68 years old. In 20 years, he has made and \\ndelivered--listen to this--more than 26,274 handmade wooden crosses, \\nStars of David, and crescent moons to communities across this country.\\n  Greg drove to Sandy Hook, CT, after 26 first graders and educators \\nwere murdered in their grade school. He drove to Las Vegas after 58 \\npeople were killed at a music festival. He drove to the First Baptist \\nChurch in Sutherland Springs, TX, after 26 worshipers were killed. He \\ndrove to Pittsburgh, PA, to honor the 11 worshipers killed at the Tree \\nof Life synagogue.\\n  Even after all that tragedy, the mass murder at Henry Pratt hit Greg \\nZanis especially hard. You see, Greg Zanis's hometown is Aurora, IL. \\nMr. Zanis told a reporter from the New York Times that he could drive \\naway from all of the other tragedies, but he said: ``I am not going to \\nbe able to get away from this one.''\\n  To those who will say that the aftermath of a mass shooting is not \\nthe time to talk about gun safety, I have one simple question: When is \\nthe right time to talk about gun safety? If we are going to talk about \\nit only on the days when no one dies in America because of the use of \\nguns, then, of course, we will never talk about it.\\n  Will you wait until this killing comes to your community, your \\nchurch, your kid's school? Is that what it will take before Members of \\nthe Senate and the people across this Nation feel as Greg Zanis does, \\nthat you just can't escape this carnage anymore? I pray that is not the \\ncase.\\n  We need to work together. Let's start. Let's do something sensible \\nand bipartisan in the name of gun safety to make our background check \\nsystems as effective as they can be.\\n  Look at those faces. Eleven days ago, they were alive, part of a \\nfamily, loved--sons, fathers, grandfathers--and now they are gone \\nbecause one man who never should have owned a gun took it to work in a \\nfit of anger and killed these five men. It is time for this Senate and \\nthis Congress to do something.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Other', 'Technology', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=38, text=\"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reality, of course, is that \\napprehensions at the southwest border have dropped 75 percent since \\n2000. The reality is that many of the southern border communities have \\nviolent crime rates that are lower than our national average. The \\nreality is that the vast majority of the drugs that are apprehended at \\nthe border are seized at the ports of entry, and a wall would do \\nnothing to stop this. The President is either out of touch with \\nreality, willfully ignoring it, or not even reading the material he \\ngets from his administration.\\n  Presidents do have emergency powers, but they should be invoked only \\nin true times of crises. It is an abuse of power to invoke these \\nauthorities simply as a political step to energize a President's base. \\nIt is an abuse of power to invoke these authorities to fulfill a \\ncynical campaign promise he never should have made. The President knew \\nhe would never keep his word or the promise he had made that Mexico \\nwould pay for this border wall.\\n  When Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to convey \\nthese powers to the President, it assumed whoever sat in the Oval \\nOffice would have enough respect for the office and the power being \\nconveyed not to abuse it. President Trump has failed that test. Since \\n1976, Presidents of the United States--Republicans and Democrats \\nalike--have upheld and passed the test. President Trump has failed the \\ntest. Look what he wants to do. The President wants to raid money that \\nis meant for military housing and military base improvements to pay for \\nhis wall. This is at a time when studies are coming out that show how \\nour men and women in the military are being housed in inferior or \\ndangerous conditions. Sometimes the buildings have mold and decay, and \\nit affects their health. The buildings are rat invested and roach \\ninfested, but the President wants to take the money away from them to \\nbuild a wall that we do not need. The President has repeatedly decried \\nthe amount of drugs coming across our border. But now he wants to raid \\nmoney that Congress has appropriated for proven drug programs and \\ncounter-drug programs to pay for his wall.\\n\\n  Let me repeat that. In order to build a wall that would do very \\nlittle to stop drugs from coming across our border, President Trump \\nwants to take money away from law enforcement programs that actually \\nprevent drugs from coming across our border or from programs that \\nenhance military readiness. I wish I were making this up. It sounds \\nlike something you hear on a comedy program, but it is not comedy, it \\nis reality, and I have to ask, what is going on?\\n  In the days and weeks ahead, the President's emergency declaration--\\nwhich amounts to an end run around both the Constitution and Congress--\\nis going to be challenged, and it should be. Over the past 2 years, we \\nhave seen the erosion of our institutional checks and balances in the \\nface of creeping authoritarianism. The time has come for Congress and \\nmembers of the President's own party to take a stand. Are we a \\ndemocracy, or are we an authoritarian government? It is a pretty basic \\nquestion.\\n  I have been here with every President since President Gerald Ford. \\nThey upheld the Constitution, Republicans and Democrats, and they \\nbelieved in the separation of power. All of them did. We simply cannot \\nafford to now remain silent in the face of such an unprecedented \\nviolation of the separation of powers.\\n  It is interesting. As I sit here, I remember some of my Republican \\nfriends--and they are my friends--when President Obama was President. \\nThey shouted from every rooftop about the lurches of an imperial \\nPresidency. In every Executive order, they saw a threat to Congress's \\npower. In every speech, they surmised the machinations of a lawless \\nstrong man--a man Donald Trump claimed wasn't born in the United \\nStates. Now, when they are faced with a President who is literally \\nusing his Executive powers to fund what Congress specifically would \\nnot, my Republican friends should echo the same concerns.\\n  I am glad that some in the Republican Party have begun expressing \\ntheir reservations about President Trump's national emergency \\ndeclaration. Certainly a number of Republicans who serve in national \\nsecurity positions who signed on to the material\\n\\n\\nI have put in the Record did. But fleeting comments to reporters in the \\nhallway are meaningless unless they are willing to follow up their \\nwords with their votes.\\n  Today, the House will vote to disapprove the President's declaration. \\nI believe that joint resolution of disapproval will pass the House. In \\nshort order, the Senate will have to vote on it. That is going to be \\nthe true test. That will be the metric history uses to determine \\nwhether Republicans are willing to put our country, our Constitution, \\nand Congress itself over party.\\n  While the President's emergency declaration stumbles its way through \\nthe courts, I hope my Republican friends take a moment to take stock of \\nwhere we are. President Trump will be just a blip in our Nation's \\nhistory. But for the sake of appeasing a man who hundreds of times made \\na foolish campaign promise, never grounded in reality, will they \\nforever change the course of the separation of powers in our country? \\nFor the sake of appeasing a President who detests any limits or checks \\non his authority, will they forever diminish the role of Congress as a \\ncoequal branch of government? We are the longest surviving democracy on \\nEarth today because there are checks and balances.\\n  I am reminded of words of caution written by George Washington, our \\nFounding Father and our Nation's first President, in his Farewell \\nAddress. The words are as true today, and we read this Farewell Address \\nevery year on the floor of the Senate. Here is what President \\nWashington wrote over 223 years ago:\\n\\n       It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a \\n     free Country should inspire caution in those entrusted with \\n     its administration, to confine themselves within their \\n     respective Constitutional spheres; avoiding in the exercise \\n     of the Powers of one department to encroach upon another. The \\n     spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all \\n     the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form \\n     of government, a real despotism. . . . If in the opinion of \\n     the People, the distribution or modification of the \\n     Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be \\n     corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \\n     designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for \\n     though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, \\n     it is the customary weapon by which free governments are \\n     destroyed.\\n\\n  That is what George Washington said. He warned us against despots. \\nRemember, this was a man who could have remained President for life, \\nand he voluntarily stepped down after a second term. He was a man who \\ndid that because he wanted democracy to thrive.\\n  He spoke of the three coequal branches of government--the executive, \\nthe legislative, and the judiciary--and he was reminding us that if you \\nlet one encroach upon the other, you start down the path of despotism. \\nWe don't need that in this country, especially in this age. We don't.\\n  We know what despots are like. We see them around the world. We see \\nthem in South America today, in one country in particular. We see them \\nin North Korea, where the despot had his uncle executed, his own \\nbrother murdered, and thousands of people are imprisoned, starved, and \\ndying. A despot who continues to build nuclear weapons to keep himself \\nin power even as his people die of starvation. In a democracy, that \\ndoesn't happen. We have checks and balances for a reason.\\n  I am going to vote aye on this joint resolution of disapproval. I \\nurge all Senators to do the same. Have checks and balances.\\n  I remind the President to treat emergency declarations the same way \\nthey have been treated since 1976, the way--certainly in my \\nexperience--Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, both Bushes, Clinton, and \\nObama did. That preserved democracy. Was it frustrating to each of them \\nat times? Of course it was. I remember long discussions with President \\nFord, President Carter, President Reagan, President George H. W. Bush, \\nPresident George W. Bush, President Clinton, and President Obama. They \\nwould say: We want to do this. A number of us had to say: You don't \\nhave the authority to do that. And they realized that.\\n  It is not the person who holds the office. It is not the Presiding \\nOfficer. It is not me. It is not the other 98 Members of this body. It \\nis not the President of the United States. It is not the Members of the \\nHouse. It is not the members of the courts. What rules this country is \\nour Constitution. We are a democracy. We must keep it as a democracy. \\nLook what happens in those countries where they ignore democracy and \\nhave despots. In Venezuela, people are going without food and medicine. \\nIn the Philippines, where there is a despot, there have been murders of \\npeople who are just under suspicion, encouraged by him. We have seen \\nthe deaths of thousands of people in North Korea because of a despot \\nwho does not care and has no sense of morality.\\n  America is so much better. Follow our Constitution. Obey our \\nConstitution. Realize there are checks and balances. Have both \\nRepublicans and Democrats stand up and join. Remember what George \\nWashington said. It was good advice back then; it is good advice today.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=42, text=\"  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent \\nfrom yesterday evening's vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to S. \\n311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. On vote No. 27, \\nhad I been present, I would have been a yea vote on the motion to \\ninvoke cloture.\\n  Let me say that a little differently. As I sat, waiting for my plane \\nto leave Charleston, SC, to come to the Nation's Capital--a trip that \\ntypically takes about 63 minutes--3 hours later, I had not yet arrived \\nin Washington, DC.\\n  On a vote that, to me, should not be a vote at all--this should be \\ncommon sense, but it certainly was not common sense, so we had to have \\na vote on an issue that is very near and dear to my heart.\\n  I will say without any question that the frustration I felt at being \\nlate to that vote was one that was incredibly irritating and \\ninfuriating. I had planned to be on the floor of the Senate voting yes \\non a commonsense piece of legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion \\nSurvivors Protection Act, but was unable to make it because a 1-hour \\nflight took more than 3 hours, and I arrived here about 4 minutes after \\nthe close of the vote, which also is quite frustrating.\\n  But what is even more frustrating than that is that in a nation of \\ngood conscience, we would be debating and having a conversation about a \\nchild who is born, sitting there, alive, separated from her mother, \\nthat there would be a question of whether that child should be able to \\ncontinue to live.\\n  This is an issue that has been raised by people coming out of New \\nYork and more recently by people coming out of Virginia and by the \\nGovernor--who happens to be, from my understanding, a pediatric \\nsurgeon--who suggested it is OK to allow that child to die.\\n  Whether you are pro-life, as I am, or pro-choice, as others, I cannot \\nimagine that this would even be an issue of debate or discussion \\nbetween the two sides. There is no side on this topic. There cannot be \\na side about life separated from the mother and whether that life \\nshould continue to live. This is common sense. This is human decency. \\nThis is not an issue of being pro-life or pro-choice. This is being \\npro-child, which we all should be.\\n  So I find myself at a loss for words, standing on the floor of the \\nU.S. Senate--where a vote yesterday failed by several votes--having to \\ndiscuss what doesn't make sense.\\n  I have recently spoken to a group in Charleston, SC, during Black \\nHistory Month, where the GOP and African Americans were in the same \\nroom having a great conversation about the issues that are important to \\nour Nation. We talked about so many of the powerful issues of economic \\nopportunity and opportunity zones. There may have been some \\ndisagreement on whether we should have higher taxes or lower taxes, but \\nthere was no disagreement on the issue of infanticide. There was no \\ndisagreement whatsoever. In the room, whether you were to the left\\n\\n\\nor to the right, there was one thing that was common, and that was the \\nvalue of life.\\n  I traveled to Little Rock, AR, this weekend to speak at another Black \\nHistory Month event, where Republicans and Democrats were coming \\ntogether at the Governor's Mansion to have a conversation about moving \\nthis Nation forward and about reconciliation. In the room, we had \\nconversations about the tragedies in Virginia, from the blackface \\ntragedy to the issues with the three ranking members in the \\nCommonwealth of Virginia. When I started talking about the value of \\nhuman life, the intrinsic value of each human being, there was 100 \\npercent support that we are a nation that should always value the life \\nof a born-alive child. There was not a single dissent in a room of \\nnearly 400 people.\\n  To have to have a debate on the floor of the Senate about something \\nthat every American with whom I have spoken, in airports or at events, \\nagrees there is nothing to debate, frustrates me. So while I am \\nsaddened and frustrated, I have been encouraged by my fellow \\nAmericans--from Arkansas to South Carolina, to Tennessee--who have all \\ncome to the same conclusion, and that is that a born-alive child \\ndeserves to live.\\n  We may disagree on other points, but this is a place where there is \\nuniversal agreement with the folks I have spoken to. These are folks \\nwho don't vote for Republicans or Democrats; they all vote for \\nchildren. They all vote for life.\\n  We are a nation that must continue to value life. For some reason, \\nsomehow, this body missed that opportunity to reinforce that value \\nsystem before the American public, to say to each child born: No matter \\nyour State, no matter your challenges, you have intrinsic value.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=50, text=\"  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yesterday evening the Senate had an \\nopportunity to go on record and show our constituents that we supported \\nthe most vulnerable among us. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors \\nProtection Act would require doctors to treat a baby, once it is born, \\nwith ordinary medical assistance, something they would do under any \\nother circumstances, even though this entailed surviving an abortion.\\n  If you ask the American people, they would say this is just common \\nsense. In a recent poll, more than three-fourths of Americans said they \\nsupport providing medical treatment for babies who survive abortions. I \\ncan't imagine what the other 25 percent are thinking. But there are no \\nFederal laws requiring healthcare providers to care for these babies \\njust as they would any other infant in their care, and for some Members \\nof the opposing party, they are just fine with that.\\n  We all know that a few weeks ago, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam \\nmade disturbing comments about how to not care for certain newborns. He \\nwas asked: What would you do with a child with birth defects?\\n  He said: Well, the infant would be delivered. The infant would be \\nkept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated, if that is what the \\nmother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue \\nbetween the physicians and the mother.\\n  Let me be clear. The Governor, who is a pediatrician, by the way, \\nessentially advocated for infanticide--killing a child who was born \\nalive. Instead of saying, ``well, it is my duty as a physician under \\nthe Hippocratic Oath to provide care to save the child,'' he believes \\nthe child ought to be made comfortable, and then the mother and doctor \\nsit down and decide whether the child should live or die.\\n  That is not healthcare. That is murder. I believe the Senate has a \\nduty to act and ensure that no child born alive is subjected to the \\ntreatment described by Governor Northam.\\n  The bill we voted on last night would protect newborns who have \\nsurvived abortions and ensure that they receive the same level of care \\nthat any other newborn baby would. It builds upon a previous law, which \\nthe Senate passed unanimously, called the Born-Alive Infant Protection \\nAct. That bill passed unanimously in 2002, and it clarified that every \\ninfant born alive at any stage of development is a person, regardless \\nof the manner in which they were born. Yet yesterday, 44 Senators voted \\nto allow that same person's life to be ended with impunity.\\n  The legislation we voted on yesterday would simply clarify that the \\ninfants who survive abortions are entitled to the same lifesaving care \\nthat other babies should receive. That is why it is so shocking to me \\nthat 44 of our colleagues chose to vote against even proceeding to a \\ndebate and a vote on the matter.\\n  I am trying to think of a historical counterpart to this. I was \\nreminded of a book I read not long ago called ``Eichmann in \\nJerusalem.'' This is about the trial of Adolf Eichmann after the \\natrocities of the holocaust, during which 5 million Jews were killed. \\nThe author, Hannah Arendt, was trying to figure out what kind of \\nmonster could basically provide for the machinery that ultimately would \\ntake the lives of 5 million Jews.\\n  What she saw when she looked at Eichmann was not some monster that \\nlooked different from you or me. Unfortunately, what she saw was \\nsomebody who looked exactly like you and me. She wrote about the moral \\ncollapse associated with the holocaust. She noted that ``in the Third \\nReich, evil lost its distinctive characteristic by which most people \\nhad, until then, recognized it.'' She said that the problem is that at \\nthat point it became a ``civil norm.''\\n  She wrote:\\n\\n       Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought, for \\n     as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and \\n     examine the premises and principles from which it originates, \\n     it is frustrated because it finds nothing there.\\n\\n  ``That,'' she said, ``is the banality of evil.''\\n  She concluded by saying:\\n\\n       Nearly everybody who attended the trials of mass killers \\n     after the war, some of them respected doctors and \\n     pharmacists, came away with the disconcerting impression that \\n     the killers looked pretty much like you and me.\\n\\n  So while Republicans and Democrats disagree on a range of issues, \\nthis should not be one of them. If we have one shred of our humanity \\nleft, we ought to agree that protecting human life is essential. This \\nshould have been a simple vote for every single Member of this body. I \\ncan't tell you how disappointed I am that 44 of our colleagues decided \\nto vote no. I was proud to vote yes on the bill, yes to protecting \\nthese newborn babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and \\nyes to life.\\n\\n\\n                        Prescription Drug Prices\\n\\n  Madam President, this morning, the Senate Finance Committee held the \\nsecond in a series of hearings on prescription drug pricing. We all \\nknow that across the country, the rising costs of prescription drugs is \\nplacing a strain on families.\\n  A survey last summer found that many Texans are struggling to afford \\nthe rising cost of healthcare, and three out of five people surveyed \\nreported foregoing or postponing care because of the cost. That \\nincludes cutting pills in half, skipping or rationing doses, or not \\nfilling a prescription because they simply can't afford to do so. Some, \\nthough, are taking even more drastic steps.\\n  Last year, a widow in Austin considered selling her house to pay for \\nthe expensive drugs she needed to treat hepatitis C, which had killed \\nher husband years earlier. Many Texas families have begun the dangerous \\npractice of buying their drugs in Mexico--even though they may be \\ncounterfeit--because they think they are more affordable than filling a \\nprescription in the United States.\\n  With healthcare costs continuing to press more and more of our hard-\\nworking families, things aren't expected to get any easier any time \\nsoon. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that \\nbetween 2018 and 2027, consumers could expect to see prescription drug \\nspending increase by an average of 6.1 percent a year. That is a\\n\\n\\nfaster increase than hospital stays, doctors' visits, or any other cost \\nin the healthcare sector.\\n  This spending doesn't just have an impact on patients. It accounts \\nfor a large portion of our national economy. In 2017, the national \\nhealth expenditures totaled $3.5 trillion. That is 18 percent of our \\ngross domestic product. Prescription drugs account for 10 percent of \\nour total health expenditures, more than $330 billion. They have an \\nimpact on our entire country.\\n  The Senate Finance Committee is digging into the reason behind those \\nrising costs. The journey a drug takes from research and development to \\nthe manufacturing plant, to pharmacy shelves, and to our medicine \\ncabinet is enormously complicated. I wonder whether it is complicated \\nby design. Once a consumer has purchased a drug, figuring out who gets \\neach dollar spent practically requires the forensic skills of a \\nSherlock Holmes.\\n  What I find particularly concerning, and something we spoke about at \\nlength today, are the rebates and other discounts provided by \\nmanufacturers. Pricing from one pharmacy to another can be wildly \\ninconsistent, and rebates are often the root of the problem. In another \\ncontext, what is now called a rebate might be called a kickback. \\nRebates are the key to determining if a particular drug is covered by \\nyour insurance, and that can impact therapies that you have access to. \\nDespite the impact they have, the terms of rebates are mostly cloaked \\nin secrecy. I don't think that is an accident. If you ask pharmacy \\nbenefit managers and plans about rebates, they will argue that overall \\nthey are a good thing and can help lower insurance premiums across the \\nboard. The issue, though, is that the extra money has to come from \\nsomewhere. So list prices are often raised to cover the difference. \\nWhen that happens, the consumers are the ones who take the hit. For \\neverything you pay within your deductible--and many deductibles in this \\npost-Affordable Care Act era are up in the thousands of dollars--you \\npay 100 percent of the retail cost. You get zero benefit from the \\nrebate. As the list price goes up, your out-of-pocket costs go up. That \\nis why the stories of families struggling to cover costs are becoming \\nmore and more prevalent.\\n  Some of the people who suffer the most from the rebate system are \\npeople who take insulin. Diabetes is one of the most common and \\npernicious illnesses in our healthcare system in America today. Because \\nwe eat too well and exercise too little, many people develop diabetes, \\nand the only treatment is to take insulin. Unlike most of the \\nprescription drugs out there, insulin is a biologic, meaning it is \\ngenerally more expensive to make and more expensive to buy.\\n  A few weeks ago, I spoke here on the Senate floor about a woman from \\nIndiana who came to the first hearing we had on prescription drug \\ncosts, Kathy Sego. She told us about her family's struggle to pay for \\nher adult son's insulin. Even though this drug has been around for \\nnearly a century, a 1-month supply for Kathy's son Hunter costs her \\nfamily $1,700 out of pocket.\\n  Unlike many brand-name prescription drugs that have lower-cost \\nalternatives, like a generic, insulin does not. Part of our discussion \\nat today's hearing was the topic of ``biosimilars,'' or what could be \\nconsidered a generic version of a biologic type of drug. As the FDA is \\nmoving to make insulin subject to biologic competition in the future, I \\nasked our witnesses about this move and how it could potentially serve \\nas a solution for families like Kathy's, who struggle with the out-of-\\npocket costs and copays as a result of the insulin with which they \\ntreat their diabetes.\\n  As part of that effort, last week, Chairman Grassley and Ranking \\nMember Wyden launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices. \\nIn letters to leading insulin manufacturers, they requested information \\non the recent price increases--some as high as 585 percent.\\n  As I expressed today to one of the representatives from the drug \\ncompany, I understand the need for drug companies to do research and \\ndevelopment and that because they are granted patents for these \\ninnovative cures that they come up with, they have the exclusive right \\nto sell those drugs during the terms of the patents. Yet I don't \\nunderstand why a drug that has been around for decades, like insulin, \\nstill costs $1,700 for somebody to pay each month on an out-of-pocket \\nbasis, and where we have seen recent price increases as high as 585 \\npercent, it makes absolutely zero sense to me. I am eager to hear from \\nthese manufacturers and other players in the pharmaceutical system \\nabout why these prices are rising so rapidly and how we, in working \\ntogether, can provide relief to families who bear the brunt of \\nmanufacturers' decisions.\\n  I conclude by saying that I also had an interesting conversation with \\none of the witnesses from the drug companies, the manufacturer of \\nHUMIRA. HUMIRA is one of the best-selling drugs in the world for the \\ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other things. The company that \\nmakes HUMIRA earns $18 billion a year in revenue from the sale of \\nHUMIRA. When I asked why it was necessary for the company to have more \\nthan 100 different patents to cover that drug when the drug is \\nessentially the same molecule, the gentleman representing the drug \\ncompany did not give me a satisfactory answer.\\n  I can understand the importance of recouping those R&D costs and the \\nbenefits of providing a patent for a reasonable period of time to \\nrecoup those costs and make a profit. I am OK with that. Yet, when you \\nsee the patent system being manipulated in a way that maintains that \\nexclusive right to sell that best-selling drug by a drug company, that \\ncauses me grave concern. I have talked to Chairman Graham of the \\nJudiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over patent-related issues, \\nand he told me he would work with me to find a solution to gaming the \\npatent system in order to protect that exclusive right to sell a drug \\nbeyond the normal patent period because it is, ultimately, the \\nconsumers who are being cheated and being denied access to the lower \\ncost drugs.\\n  As with insulin, there is no good reason why, after all of these \\nyears, consumers have to see price increases approaching 585 percent. \\nWe need answers to those questions, and we will get answers to those \\nquestions.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Abortion'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=54, text=\"  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the pending \\nnomination of Eric Miller to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of \\nAppeals in a seat based out of the State of Washington.\\n  If the Senate chooses to confirm Mr. Miller, it will be a historic \\ndecision because it will be the first time ever since the introduction \\nof blue slips over 100 years ago that the Senate has confirmed a \\nnominee who is not supported by either of the home State Senators from \\nthe State in which he will be seated.\\n  What is a blue slip? It is basically a consultation with the Senate \\nbefore we move forward on a nomination. It is a courtesy that has been \\nextended. It is an effort to try to find some common ground, some \\nunderstanding, perhaps some moderation when it comes to the choice of \\nnominees. It has been abused in some cases, but the two Senators here--\\nSenator Cantwell and Senator Murray--are well known in this body for \\nbeing reasonable people who try to find solutions to problems and work \\nwell with both sides of the aisle. Yet, in this case, the Trump White \\nHouse has decided that they are going to push this nominee for the \\nNinth Circuit in their home State of Washington against their wishes. \\nIf Mr. Miller is confirmed, we will have taken away yet another \\nguardrail in the Senate advice and consent process.\\n  If you follow what has happened in the Senate over the last 2 years \\nand a few months, you know that the highest single priority of Senator \\nMcConnell's--the Republican leader--is to fill the Federal judgeships, \\nto put in place men and women who will serve literally for a lifetime, \\nas long as they live. He is determined to do it. There is a template \\nfor the people who they find acceptable. If you have been a law\\n\\n\\nclerk for Clarence Thomas, you check the box, you are ready to go--a \\nlifetime appointment. If the Federalist Society decides you are the \\nright person for the Supreme Court of the United States, box checked, \\noff we go.\\n  Instead of relying on common sense, moderation, and judgment, we are \\ngoing through a formula here to put people on the bench for a \\nlifetime--those who have been approved on the Republican side of the \\naisle. Make no mistake--under Democratic Presidents, we look to \\nnominees who are closer to our value system, for sure, but we never \\nwalked away from the blue slip process until this nominee--the first \\ntime ever it has been done.\\n  We have seen so many things change under the Republican leadership in \\nthe Senate when it comes to the selection of judges.\\n  We used to say that if you are found unqualified--not qualified--by \\nthe American Bar Association, forget it. Go about your business. Do \\nsomething else. We are not going to put you on the bench for life. \\nWell, we have decided, under the Republican leadership, that is no \\nlonger the case. Simply being unqualified is not enough to disqualify \\nyou.\\n  We have also said that when it comes to the process of making these \\ndecisions, we will have hearings where we will consider multiple \\ncandidates in the same day. Let's run them through. Of course, you know \\nwhat happens when you do that: You get in a hurry, and you end up \\nputting people on the bench for life who shouldn't be there.\\n  We have also decided in this White House that we will send people off \\nto be Federal judges who have never been in a courtroom in their \\nlives--not once. Maybe they watched ``Perry Mason'' on some retro \\nchannel, but that is about as good as it ever was for some of them.\\n  I recall one of the nominees from the Trump White House. It was a \\nmoment in the history of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator John \\nKennedy of Louisiana asked him some basic questions about what it meant \\nto be a judge and some of the things he would have to rule on. It was a \\nsad moment. It reminded me of my worst days in law school when I didn't \\nknow the answers to the test or to the question being asked by the \\nprofessor. This nominee, thankfully, withdrew. He never should have \\nbeen nominated.\\n  In this case, when it comes to Mr. Miller, neither of the Washington \\nSenators returned a blue slip on him, and they have a reason. He is 43 \\nyears old; he may serve on the bench for three decades or more. In his \\nrelatively short legal career, he has demonstrated that his views are \\nfar outside the legal mainstream, particularly when it comes to one \\nlegal issue--the issue involving Indian Tribes.\\n  I don't know if you watched the Oscars, but I did, and I was watching \\nfor a movie that I saw that I was impressed with. It was called \\n``Roma.'' It was a movie about Mexico. It received quite a few awards, \\nand I thought it deserved them. It raised some painful questions for \\npeople living in Mexico. I know because I have spoken to Mexican \\nParliamentarians at a dinner a few weeks ago. It is the treatment of \\nindigenous people.\\n  Most countries in the world, including the United States, haven't \\nwritten a very admirable record when it comes to the treatment of \\npeople who were here before we ``arrived.'' What we have done to Native \\nAmericans in this country, sadly, is nothing to brag about. They were \\ndispossessed, relocated for their lands, and many times treated in the \\npoorest possible fashion. The movie ``Roma'' was about indigenous \\npeople of Mexico who are servants, and some would say slaves, to \\nfamilies who have more money in Mexico. So the question of the \\ntreatment of Native Americans is not something that we can just push \\nback in the pages of history; it still confronts us in the United \\nStates today, as it does in other countries, like Mexico and Australia \\nand so many others.\\n  So what does this have to do with this nominee? It turns out that in \\na rare moment, the National Congress of American Indians weighed in \\nagainst Eric Miller for this circuit court nomination. The National \\nCongress of American Indians opposed his nomination. Here is what they \\nwrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, and I want to quote it in \\nits substance:\\n\\n       Our concern is that he chose to build a law practice on \\n     mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands, \\n     religious freedom, and the core attribute of federal \\n     recognition of tribal existence. His advocacy has focused on \\n     undermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme \\n     positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal \\n     rights. Indeed, his law firm website touts his record, with \\n     over half of his private practice achievements coming at the \\n     expense of tribal governments. Given his strong preference \\n     for clients who oppose tribes, there are considerable \\n     questions about whether he would be fair in hearing cases \\n     regarding tribal rights.\\n\\n  You might say to yourself: Well, that has to be a narrow area of the \\nlaw--Tribal rights--and if he happens to consistently get that wrong, \\nhow important could it be?\\n  Take a look at the fact that he has aspired to be a nominee to the \\ncircuit court--the second highest court in the land--in the Ninth \\nCircuit. The Ninth Circuit includes 427 of the 573 federally recognized \\nTribal nations of America. That circuit he aspires to for a lifetime \\nappointment hears more cases involving Tribal issues than any other \\nFederal circuit. It is deeply troubling to see a Ninth Circuit nominee \\nwhose impartiality on Tribal legal matters is in question.\\n  Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by not only the National Congress \\nof American Indians; he is also opposed by a broad array of civil \\nrights, environmental, labor, and other organizations that are \\nconcerned about his record and legal views. He is 43 years old--43 \\nyears old--three more decades to hand down decisions.\\n  It is astonishing that the Senate would vote to confirm a nominee \\nthis controversial over the objection of home State Senators and to \\nbreak a century-old tradition in the Senate to do it. These Senators \\nrepresent millions of people in the State of Washington. Their good \\njudgment has been recognized by election and reelection. But when it \\ncomes to having a voice in the selection of a circuit court nominee who \\nwill be serving their State for the next three decades, they have been \\nshunned and pushed aside.\\n  I think the Republican majority is making a mistake. They are so \\nbound and determined to fill these vacancies that they are abandoning \\nbasic Senate traditions--which, in fact, will slow things down from \\ntime to time, I am ready to admit, but also put at least a note of \\ncaution into a critical judgment process.\\n  Blue slips encourage consensus and cooperation between the Senate and \\nthe White House. There isn't a single one of us serving in the Senate \\nwho hasn't counted on that cooperation to make sure that lifetime \\nappointments to the Federal judiciary are people who can stand the test \\nof time. Although they may not agree with any Senator every single \\ntime, they bring judgment, experience, balance, and moderation to their \\nservice. Blue slips ensure that the voices of the American people, \\nthrough their Senators, are heard in this process, and they help steer \\nthe nomination process toward the middle of the road. Without blue \\nslips, the White House can ignore home State interests and pick extreme \\njudges who do not have the confidence of that State's legal community.\\n  This decision--for the first time in a century--to abandon blue slips \\nfor the sake of putting this man in a lifetime position on the circuit \\nbench could affect every one of our States someday. I can't understand \\nwhy my Republican colleagues want to diminish their authority, their \\nability to safeguard against judges who should not be appointed for \\nlife. That is what we are doing on the vote to confirm Eric Miller to \\nthe Ninth Circuit.\\n  I will oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same, if \\nfor no other reason, so that when the time comes--if it ever comes--\\nthat you ask for the respect of this body when it comes to the \\nselection of an important Federal judge, you will receive it regardless \\nof who the President may be.\\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=61, text=\"  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, there have been some days recently when \\nI kind of wonder why we even show up to the Senate any longer. This job \\nis not what it used to be.\\n  When I get the chance to read about the history of the Senate, I read \\nabout these things called debates that we used to have on the floor of \\nthe Senate. I read about something called an amendment, which \\napparently is a way that an individual Senator calls up a proposal or \\nan initiative and puts it on the floor for an up-or-down vote.\\n  Those things don't really happen anymore in the U.S. Senate. We don't \\nhave open-ended debates on the big policies of the day.\\n  I get it. When Republicans control the Senate, they control the \\nagenda. When Democrats control the Senate, they control the agenda. At \\nthe very least, I would have hoped that the Senate majority, now in \\nRepublican hands, would put their policy initiatives before the Senate \\nso we could have an open debate. That doesn't happen any longer. All we \\nseem to be doing these days is voting on judges.\\n  Now, that is a really important function of the U.S. Senate, and I am \\nglad we are doing it, but today we are going to do something truly \\nexceptional, which causes me, once again, to wonder what my job here is \\nand to feel a little bit of sadness as to how it has changed and how \\nmuch less substantive the input of each individual Senator is in the \\ndirection of this country.\\n  Today, for the first time in the history of blue slips, we are going \\nto vote and, I assume, confirm a judge who didn't get one blue slip \\nfrom either of the home State Senators from which that judge comes from \\nand is going to serve.\\n  This has never happened before. Yet today we will vote on Eric \\nMiller's nomination to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit from Washington. \\nHe is 43 years old, so he is going to be there for an awfully long \\ntime.\\n  Eric Miller did not get a blue slip from either of Washington's \\nSenators. Let me say that again. That has never happened before in the \\nSenate. In fact, the last time a judge was confirmed without both blue \\nslips was in 1989. That was the last time before this Congress that any \\njudge was confirmed without both blue slips.\\n  In that instance, it was a Democratic chairman of the Judiciary \\nCommittee who was confirming a judge over the objection of another \\nDemocrat. This is very different. These are two Democratic Senators \\nfrom Washington, neither of them returning a blue slip on Eric Miller. \\nYet the majority has decided to go ahead and proceed with this \\nconfirmation.\\n  This is a serious break with precedent. The last time Democrats \\ncontrolled the U.S. Senate, Chairman Leahy was the head of the \\nJudiciary Committee, and he did not hold a single hearing on an Obama \\nnominee who did not have two blue slips--didn't hold a single hearing \\neven when there were exceptional circumstances. There was one time when \\nSenators initially returned the blue slips but later rescinded them. \\nThose are two Republican Senators who submitted them, rescinded them--\\ndid not go forward with the nominee.\\n  There was another circumstance in which Senators had recommended a \\nnominee for the district court but then refused to submit blue slips \\nwhen that judge was elevated to the appellate court. Once again, \\nSenator Leahy honored that precedent.\\n  Now Republicans have already taken advantage of Senator Leahy's \\ndecision to uphold precedent. I will just give you a couple of \\nexamples.\\n  In the Seventh Circuit, Michael Brennan was confirmed for a seat that \\nhad been held open by Republicans since 2010. So, had Chairman Leahy \\ndecided to move forward without blue slips, that Seventh Circuit seat \\ncould have been filled, but because he upheld tradition, it was left \\nopen, filled by Republicans.\\n  Similarly, for a district seat in South Carolina, Marvin Quattlebaum \\nwas confirmed to a seat that had been held open by Republicans, again, \\nsince 2013.\\n  So Republicans have already taken advantage of the fact that \\nDemocrats upheld the blue-slip precedent, but now they are taking it a \\nstep further.\\n  In the past, when Republicans have changed the rules here, as they \\ndid on the number of votes required to elevate a judge to the Supreme \\nCourt, they claimed it was because Democrats started it. I don't agree \\nwith that rationale. If you found the change for district court nominee \\nso objectionable, I am not sure why you would decide to go further, but \\nthere is no excuse of that kind here. This is just a brash power grab \\nbecause there is no claim that Democrats, when they were in the \\nmajority, violated the blue-slip principle. This is a fresh violation \\nof tradition here in the Senate.\\n  There is a reason we give deference to home State Senators. In these \\nStates and in these districts, there are particular issues that are \\nimportant to their constituents that may be unique to their area in \\nwhich they have more knowledge than the rest of us do. Some of the \\nreasons Senators Murray and Cantwell are so concerned about this \\nnominee are his extremist views on the issue of Tribal sovereignty, \\nwhich is a very big deal in the State of Washington, and the idea that \\nthey are going to have somebody sitting in the Ninth Circuit who has \\nthese extreme views on limiting the rights of Tribes is of great \\nconcern to their constituents. That is why, traditionally, we have \\nallowed for individual Senators to have that kind of voice and that \\nkind of say. No longer.\\n  I would just hope that my Republican friends understand how this \\nworks. Once the rule is gone, once the tradition is gone--listen, I am \\na relatively junior Senator here, so I don't want to speak for those \\nwho are going to be the chairman and ranking members of committees in \\nthe future, but I would imagine it is not coming back. I would \\nimagine--once we get through today and Republicans have decided that \\nindividual Senators, unless they happen to be a member of the majority \\nparty,\\n\\n\\nno longer have any say in who is appointed to their circuit courts--\\nthat horse has fully run out of the barn and across the field.\\n  I don't know if that is a good thing for this body because it is just \\nanother hit. It is just another assault on the traditions of this place \\nin which we used to try to work things out together, in which we used \\nto honor the role that individual Senators have some say over what \\nhappens in their own States and their own regions.\\n  I do sometimes wonder why we all keep on showing up here if we don't \\nreally debate legislation as we used to, if we don't get to offer \\namendments anymore, and if we don't have any say any longer in the \\njudges who are appointed in our States and our districts, and this is \\njust another day that makes me question that as well.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Other', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=63, text=\"  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to offer brief remarks on \\nthe nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe Ninth Circuit.\\n  I have concerns about Mr. Miller's controversial record--some of his \\nideas and his jurisprudence--which I have spoken to on the Senate \\nJudiciary Committee, which informed my vote against him on the \\ncommittee.\\n  But today, I want to speak about my reservations about this body's \\nmoving forward with his confirmation, given that neither of his home \\nState Senators have returned a blue slip.\\n  Let me briefly talk about what a blue slip is and why it matters. It \\nis not in the Constitution. It was not something imagined by the \\nFounders. It was something developed by the Members of this body to put \\none further bumper on the power of the President to nominate Federal \\njudges and then for the Senate to carry out its constitutional advice \\nand consent role. For a long time, it worked fine, and I actually had a \\nterrific experience with the blue-slip process. Don McGahn, as the \\nWhite House Counsel, and my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and I, when we \\nhad a vacancy--two vacancies, actually, in the Federal district court \\nin Delaware--went to our local bar and asked for them to put together a \\ncommittee to interview potential candidates.\\n  We went to the White House Counsel and spoke about the importance of \\nthe Delaware district court and the process we were following, and, in \\nthe end, out of a very wide pool of initial candidates and the folks \\nwho were interviewed by a broad and nonpartisan selection committee of \\nour local bar, we advanced three names to the White House. The White \\nHouse picked two, and they were ultimately nominated, and Senator \\nCarper and I both returned the blue slips on them. They proceeded. They \\nwere both confirmed. They are now seated as district court judges.\\n  That is the way this ought to work. Why does it matter? It matters \\nbecause our States are different. We are the United States, and each of \\nour States has slightly different cultures, traditions, and \\ncommunities. The point of having a Senate made up of 100 \\nrepresentatives of our 50 States is for each of us to come here and \\ncarry forward some of the values and traditions of our States.\\n  I am a member of the Delaware bar. It is a bar with a great and proud \\ntradition. It is a bar with a somewhat different culture--a much more \\ncollegial culture, I would argue, than many States around us, and it \\nwas important to me to be able to advocate to the President, to the \\nWhite House, for the nomination of folks who would represent the best \\nof our bench and bar.\\n  Look, the President and I are in different parties. I understand that \\nwe will have different policy positions, but in order to get the \\nabsolute best and brightest of the American bar and to have them \\nreflect the values and priorities of the State Senators are elected \\nfrom, the blue slip was developed.\\n  We have had a difficult and divisive and partisan period here in the \\nSenate for as long as I have been here. I don't think it is because I \\nam here, but it has been as long as I have been here--since 2010. We \\nhave had a number of regrettable changes in the policies and the \\npractices and the culture of this place, but proceeding with a \\nconfirmation vote of a nominee who was not supported by either home \\nState Senator for a circuit court position is unprecedented.\\n  I think, before we proceed, this body should stop and reflect on what \\nthis means for our future. In a district as small as Delaware, it is \\nlikely the Senators actually know the nominees. In a circuit as large \\nas the Ninth, which is the largest, geographically, in our whole \\ncountry, it is almost a certainty that the Senators will not know the \\njudges nominated by the President to represent their circuit.\\n  The blue slip has long been a procedural barrier to the President's \\nnominating people who did not reflect the bench and bar of the States \\nfrom which they are drawn. The leader is pushing this forward, even \\nover several other nominees pending on this floor.\\n  One other piece of the process that brought us to today to a vote on \\nEric Miller's nomination for the Ninth Circuit that is worth commenting \\non is that the confirmation hearing on the Judiciary Committee was held \\nwhile we were not in session. No Democrat was present to question this \\nnominee. The questions that were raised and the comments that were made \\nwere only in writing and for the Record, and my understanding is, this \\nquestioning is very brief--just 5 minutes before just a handful of \\nRepublican Senators, I think two.\\n  This young man is going to be given a lifetime appointment to one of \\nthe most important judicial posts in our country. Frankly, my own kids \\nhave to work longer and harder and answer more questions to get a good \\ngrade in high school than this gentleman did in terms of the \\nconfirmation process of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am very \\nworried about the precedent this sets, about what it says--which is \\nthat we continue to push past norms and traditions in this body--and \\nabout where we are headed.\\n  It is my hope that some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \\nwill work with me in the months ahead to recognize that there is a \\nlong, now-bitter path of he said, she said, who shot John, who acted \\nfirst, which has resulted in changes to the whole nomination process.\\n  I think we can yet pull back to a place where those who are nominated \\nare the best and brightest of our country, where, in the process, there \\nare protections for the minority and the majority, and where we can all \\nend up voting proudly for those who are nominated to serve on the \\nFederal bench of the United States.\\n  I increasingly hear commentators on cable talking about judges as if \\nyou can know how they will vote based on the President who nominated \\nthem. So-and-so is described as a Bush judge or a Reagan judge or a \\nClinton judge or an Obama judge, a Trump judge or a Bush judge, as if \\nthat tells you everything you need to know about a judge. It should \\nnot.\\n  In my State, it doesn't, and it is my hope that we can yet pull \\nourselves back from the brink of one more step to a place where our \\njudges are seen not as the black-robed individuals dispensing \\nindependent justice but as folks wearing blue and red jerseys advancing \\na partisan political agenda. That way lies disaster for our \\nconstitutional Republic.\\n  Both parties have taken steps that have led us here. Both parties \\nneed to take steps that will heal this, and I intend to vote against \\nthe nomination of Mr. Miller because of my concerns about these \\nprocedural changes that I think are so destructive.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=67, text=\"  Mr. TILLIS. Well, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I took a position \\nthat I think some people consider to be unpopular--particularly some of \\nmy friends back in my State--that I thought I would come back and \\nexplain. It has to do with the President's Executive action. It also \\nhas to do with communicating an important and somber subject.\\n  There is a crisis at the border. I have been there. I didn't read \\nabout it. I didn't watch it on TV. I didn't read a tweet about it. I \\ninvested time down\\n\\n\\nthere, hours and hours with border security. I was on shallow draft \\nboats. I was on horseback. I have been on ATVs. I spent a lot of time \\ndown at the border, and the one thing I will tell you is that the \\nPresident is absolutely right. There is a crisis on the border--and not \\nonly on the southern border, but I will state that ranchers on the \\nnorthern border also believe they have challenges that this President \\nis right to address.\\n  I also happen to agree with a good portion of how the President is \\ngoing to do it after Congress failed to do its job. Keep in mind that \\nover the last year, we have had on this floor Democrats and Republicans \\nvoting for as much as $25 billion for border security--Democrats and \\nRepublicans--and now we are fighting over a fraction of that.\\n  The President needs to act. He got an appropriation of about $1.5 \\nbillion through the negotiated settlement a couple of weeks ago, and \\nnow he is taking the only action he can until Congress acts, and that \\nis to figure out other sources of funding that he believes he can use \\nwithin current statutory limits. The way he has done that is he has \\nfirst taken the $1.3 billion that Congress did appropriate. He has \\nanother $2.5 billion and another $600 million that I believe he is \\nright to reprogram, send to the southern border, and probably make some \\ninvestment in the northern border.\\n  Here is where I have a respectful difference of opinion with the \\nPresident and the administration: It is the emergency order, that under \\nthe emergency powers act, he is using his authority to appropriate the \\nremaining funds.\\n  First off, those funds will come what we call the MILCON budget. That \\nis military construction. Right now, we are trying to find out what \\nthat means--which projects we think are critical to help the readiness \\nof our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines; which investments that we \\nwere going to make, that we have already determined we should make in \\nmilitary construction, are going to be put on hold while we reprogram \\nthose dollars to go to the southern border.\\n  The real problem I have is that this is only a fraction of what we \\nall know we need to secure the border.\\n  I want to go back to the humanitarian crisis, though. My wife and I \\nhad an interesting discussion the other night. She wasn't too happy \\nwhen I took this position originally. I am still not sure if she is \\nhappy.\\n  But to understand why I respectfully disagree with the President, you \\nhave to understand, again, as I started this discussion, that there is \\na crisis. There are people dying. There are millions of doses of poison \\ncoming across the border every single year that are killing tens of \\nthousands of people. That is a crisis. There are thousands of people \\ncrossing the border and dying. They have what they call coyotes, human \\ntraffickers who will get them across the border, get people who will \\npay thousands of dollars to cross the border, and then they will say: \\nCivilization is just an hour away.\\n  It is an hour plane ride away. Most people don't understand the sheer \\nsize and scale of Texas, particularly those crossing the border in the \\ndead of night, working with basically organized crime. You have to pay \\na toll to get through the so-called plazas that run the northern border \\nof Mexico.\\n  My problem right now has to do with an Executive order, the emergency \\ndeclaration that the President intends to send to Congress.\\n  My wife and I were having a discussion. She said: You just said you \\nagree with the President that there is a crisis on the border; you \\nagree with the President that we need to send resources down to the \\nsouthern border and work on the northern border; you agree that \\nCongress has failed to act; and you agree that if you were President, \\nyou would do exactly what he is doing.\\n  I said yes.\\n  She said: Why don't you support it?\\n  I said: Because I am not the President. I am a Member of the U.S. \\nSenate. I am a Member of a coequal branch who actually believes that \\nthis action falls within our purview. Now we are going to find out \\nbecause I am sure we are going to be challenged in the courts. But I \\nalso worry not so much about this one--frankly, even the way this money \\nis going to be programmed, I agree with. What I worry about are future \\nPresidents and what they may do if we set this precedent going into the \\nfuture.\\n  We actually have a Democratic candidate running for President--this \\nis one hypothetical. There have been some far-flung ones that I am not \\nsure I completely agree with, but let me give this one. It relates to \\nborder security. We have someone who is a Member of this body who has \\npublicly said that their priority, if they were elected to be \\nPresident, would be to tear down borders, tear down walls, build \\nbridges, and open the borders. Well, if you argue that there is a \\nhumanitarian crisis--and I have said there is already is one--what \\nwould prevent that President from issuing an Executive order that would \\ndivert military construction funding to tear down the walls that are \\ngoing to be built now? If we give this President--a President I support \\nand a President whose policies and priorities I agree with--that \\nauthority, that could be aiding and abetting a future President and \\nempowering them beyond what I believe their authorities are, vested in \\nthe Constitution in article II.\\n  So I have come here today in part to maybe take another stab at \\nexplaining to my wife why I have taken this position but also to \\nexplain to the American people and folks in North Carolina and across \\nthis country. I agree with the President. I know we have a crisis we \\nhave to take care of. We have a national security crisis, a homeland \\nsecurity crisis, and a humanitarian crisis. It is not the end; it is a \\nportion of the means.\\n  I applaud the President for taking the action up here and getting \\nthings going. I hope that over time, we can find a way to fully fund \\nthe border strategy on a bipartisan basis and also address other \\nimmigration issues that I believe are pressing for this Nation.\\n  Madam President, thank you for allowing me to come to the floor and \\nexplain my position.\\n  If anybody in North Carolina has any questions, I know they know how \\nto get ahold of me because my phones are blowing up right now. But I do \\nwant to explain it to them in a way that makes sense. I am a steward of \\nthe U.S. Senate. I am a steward of the article I branch.

      "Pandas(Index=69, text=\"  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to join many of my \\ncolleagues who have come to the floor and to express my opposition to \\nthe nomination of Eric Miller to be U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth \\nCircuit. I have already expressed that opposition in my vote in the \\nJudiciary Committee, but I would like to explain this in more detail.\\n  There are several troubling aspects of Mr. Miller's background, \\nparticularly his consistent opposition to Tribal interests and women's \\nreproductive rights.\\n  My State of Minnesota has a large and diverse Tribal population. I \\nhave always believed that our State history has been drawn from the \\nculture and traditions of our Native Americans.\\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I know that Tribal \\nsovereignty is a fundamental tenet of our laws. The Ninth Circuit is \\nhome to more federally recognized Tribes than any other circuit--more \\nthan 425. So many of the cases that come before the court involve \\nTribal issues. I am concerned that Mr. Miller has a history of \\nrepresenting interests that have sought to undermine Tribal \\nsovereignty. For example, in a brief he filed before the Supreme Court, \\nhe urged the Court to adopt a standard that would have undermined the \\nlegitimacy of many federally recognized Tribal governments.\\n\\n  The National Congress of American Indians and the Native American \\nRights Fund have come out against his confirmation. I know the Senator \\nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Udall, is here and understands the major concerns, \\nsince he is the ranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee, and how \\nimportant that concern is. It is only the third time in the history of \\nthese two organizations--the National Congress of American Indians and \\nthe Native American Rights Fund--that they have opposed a judicial \\nnominee.\\n  In their letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, they wrote that \\nEric\\n\\n\\nMiller ``chose to build a law practice on mounting repeated challenges \\nto tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, and the core attribute \\nof Federal recognition of Tribal existence.''\\n  I believe we need judges, particularly on the Ninth Circuit, who \\nrespect the history and contribution of Tribal nations, not one who \\nseeks to undermine their sovereign status.\\n  Mr. Miller's record on women's reproductive rights is no less \\ntroubling. During his time at the Justice Department, he used \\nideological language in cases in which he advocated for restrictions on \\na woman's personal healthcare decisions. I am concerned about what this \\nsays about how Mr. Miller will approach these types of cases.\\n  Finally, it pains me to say that this is a historic moment for this \\nbody--for the Senate--because of how we came to be here today. It is \\nnot historic in a good sense of the word. It is historic in a bad sense \\nof the word. We are voting on this nomination today because of an \\nunprecedented disregard for the Senate's traditions when it comes to \\njudicial nominations. According to the Congressional Research Service, \\nno judge has ever been confirmed without having both blue slips \\nreturned by both home State Senators until now. We have had instances \\nwhere one blue slip was returned, and the judge went on to be \\nconfirmed, but what we have here is not one blue slip from either of \\nthe home State Senators from the State of Washington was returned.\\n  Senator Cantwell, who also, by the way, has been a major leader when \\nit comes to Tribal matters, did not return a blue slip for Mr. Miller. \\nSenator Murray, a major leader when it comes to women's rights, did not \\nreturn a blue slip for Mr. Miller.\\n  In the rush to confirm judges like Mr. Miller, the Judiciary \\nCommittee has chipped away at the traditions and rules that allow us to \\nproperly advise and consent on nominations, which is our responsibility \\nspecifically enumerated in the Constitution.\\n  This goes beyond disregarding the voices of home State Senators on \\njudicial nominations. This nominee's hearing was held during a \\nmonthlong recess with no Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee. \\nSince this was an established work period at home, only two Republican \\nMembers were in attendance. Mr. Miller's questioning lasted for less \\nthan 5 minutes for a lifetime appointment. Why would you have this \\nhearing at a time when we were scheduled to be working in our home \\nStates? That is what happened because it was rammed through the Senate \\nwithout the support of either of the home State Senators.\\n  At a time when the American people see this body shirking its \\nresponsibilities to act as a check and balance on the executive branch, \\nand when they see us divided on the basic question of whether Congress \\nhas the power of the purse, I am concerned about what message we are \\nsending to the country and the world about the health of this Senate.\\n  This is a lifetime appointment. It should at least have had a normal \\nhearing. We should have at least respected the views of the home State \\nSenators as we have so many times in the past. There are no winners in \\na race to the bottom when it comes to process in the Senate--a \\ndemocratic process, a process of advice and consent, a process of \\nchecks and balances set up by our Founders so no one branch of \\ngovernment would have all the power.\\n  What do we see happening now? We see judges being put forward without \\nblue slips. What that simply means is, the home State Senators are OK \\nwith that nominee. We have had blue slips over the years in many \\nadministrations for judges who perhaps were not the first choice of the \\nhome State Senators, but they were someone they felt could be a judge \\nout of their State who would have the right experience as well as be \\nfair and impartial in the administrative law.\\n  What else do we have going on? We have a President who, after an \\nagreement was reached in the Senate, which is run by his own political \\nparty, on how to do border security--and it was a widespread vote in \\nboth the Senate and the House--he then decided to declare an emergency \\nto do something which I consider unconstitutional and has no respect \\nfor the balance of powers. He decided he would declare an emergency, \\nwhen, in fact, those kinds of emergencies are things like Hurricane \\nSandy and the weather we saw, and the damage down in Florida, or the \\nwildfires we saw in Colorado and in California. Those are emergencies. \\nIn addition to that, it raises eminent domain issues at the border.\\n  It also makes us question where the money is coming from. That is why \\nyou see these lawsuits. The money is coming from the military budget, \\nmilitary construction for our troops, and the like.\\n  While this may seem like a very different issue, it is not a \\ndifferent issue. It is the same issue. The Senate should be sticking up \\nfor the individual States we represent and the power of those States \\nand the power of that balance that is so important to running this \\ngovernment and to the very Constitution that guides us.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=73, text=\"  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, before I start with my comments, I want \\nto associate my thoughts and views on Mr. Miller with Ranking Member \\nUdall's points on Native American sovereignty and Mr. Miller's current \\njob and what he has done in that.\\n\\n\\n                        Remembering Jason Baker\\n\\n  Madam President, I come here today in a sad time. As I speak, about \\nright now in Montana, a funeral is beginning for Jason Baker.\\n  Jason was originally from Fort Benton, MT, which is a town right down \\nthe road from where I live in Big Sandy. Jason was a firefighter. Jason \\npassed away on February 20, early in the morning. He was far, far too \\nyoung--the age of 45. He had been a firefighter for 16 years with Great \\nFalls Fire Rescue. He was incredibly talented and incredibly \\nprofessional, and he was somebody who loved being a firefighter. His \\nlife of public service, whether it was helping out kids or helping out \\nadults or helping out communities, was a part of who he was as a \\nperson.\\n  Jason was also married to my wife's cousin Jill. They have two \\nchildren, Peyton and Porter, whose hearts have to be aching. This day \\nis a day, I am sure, that they had to have planned for the last 3 or so \\nyears after his diagnosis of stage IV lung cancer. I guess it was 2 \\nyears ago.\\n  I have a number of memories of Jason from my days in the State \\nlegislature, when he showed up as a relatively young firefighter, to my \\ndays as a U.S. Senator, when he showed up to my offices here in \\nWashington, DC, to advocate for firefighters' issues. More important \\nthan all of that, Jason was a friend. He happened to also be a \\nrelative. He was somebody who, when his wife's grandfather passed away \\nand they had the funeral up in Havre, was at the height of who he was \\nas a human being. He wasn't sick and hadn't been diagnosed with \\nanything. He was just vibrant and full of life.\\n  With cancer's being the disease that it is, it was a struggle for \\nhim, as it is for anybody who gets it. He was somebody who fought that \\ndisease bravely and proudly, but in the end, it took him. It took him \\nlast Wednesday, early in the morning. We were driving to Great Falls, \\nand my wife sent a little message to Jill that read our hearts were \\nwith them because we knew that Jason wasn't good. She sent back a text \\nwith hearts, and that was it. He had already passed.\\n  In the end, though, as I think back on Jason's life, there are some \\nlyrics to a song that say ``Only the good die young.'' It could not be \\nany more true than with Jason Baker. If the world were full of Jason \\nBakers, this would be a better world, but life happens, and you have to \\nget through it.\\n  I am sure that Jill and Peyton and Porter will think back and \\nremember their dad proudly as he served proudly as a firefighter, as a \\npublic servant--as somebody who ran to danger while other people were \\nrunning away from it.\\n  As they proceed with the ceremony today in Montana--and it is \\nhappening as I speak--just know, Jill, Peyton, Porter, and all of the \\nfirefighters who are there, that we are very proud of your dad and his \\nservice and what he fought for.\\n  Two years ago, there was a bill in the Montana Legislature on \\npresumptive illness for firefighters. I do not believe Jason would have \\ncontracted cancer if not for his job, if not for the kinds of fumes he \\nbreathed when he protected neighborhoods and families. I think it is \\nonly right that when people sacrifice for their communities, we \\nsacrifice for them. Two years ago, the legislature did not pass that \\npresumptive illness bill. I think it made a mistake.\\n  When I gave my speech to the House of Representatives in the Montana \\nLegislature, one of the points I made in that speech was that they \\nneeded to pass the presumptive healthcare bill for firefighters. Jason \\nwas alive when I gave that speech, and now he has passed. I think, in \\nmemory of Jason Baker, at the very least, the Montana Legislature could \\npass that bill. I understand it has passed one of the houses but that \\nit hasn't passed both of them. If it passes both houses, I know \\nGovernor Bullock will sign that bill.\\n  So, with that, we bid adieu to a great American, a great community \\nman--somebody who literally gave it all for his country and his State \\nand his town.\\n  We will miss you, Jason Baker.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=77, text=\"  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, we are in the midst of a stealth \\ncampaign. Normally, we think about ``stealth'' as associated with \\nbombers or submarines, weapons platforms designed to go, in effect, \\nunder the radar, to avoid detection, to escape public notice or the \\nnotice of our adversaries.\\n  This stealth campaign is really hiding in plain sight. It is a \\ncampaign to remake our Federal judiciary in the image of the far-right \\nextreme of the Republican Party, the far-right extreme ideologically \\nand politically, a campaign, in effect, to outsource selections of \\njudges to groups that reflect those extreme points of view--the \\nHeritage Society and other such groups.\\n  Shortly, we will consider the nomination of the latest individual \\nnominated by the President, outsourced to those groups: Eric Miller, of \\nWashington, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The effort here is \\nto drastically reshape our judiciary but, in the process, also \\ndismantle the norms and practices critical to the health of our \\ndemocracy. The judiciary is essential to the health of our democracy.\\n  In the future, when we look back on this era--a dark and dangerous \\ntime for our democracy--the heroes will be our free press and our \\nindependent judiciary because they have been selected in the past by \\nboth Republican and Democratic Presidents based on qualities of \\nintegrity, intelligence, and independence.\\n  That norm, common to both Republican and Democratic administrations \\nin the past, has been broken by this one. One of the norms that has \\nbeen broken in the U.S. Senate relates to the use of blue slips. Most \\nof the public has no idea what blue slips are. They are the traditional \\nmechanism used over decades to afford home State Senators the \\nopportunity to express their approval or disapproval for fitness, a \\nbasic quality of a President's judicial nominee to a court that has \\njurisdiction over their State.\\n  What is the reason? Well, Senators just happen to spend a lot of time \\ntalking with folks at home. We talk to farmers, businesspeople, \\nlawyers. A lot of those lawyers know fellow lawyers. Of course, we \\nreceive the ABA qualified or unqualified ratings, but they are single \\nwords based on fact gathering that may or may not be as reliable as our \\ncolleagues--the lawyers who appear in front of judges, who go to court \\nevery day, who have settlement conferences, who rely on the word of \\ntheir colleagues, which is either good or bad, who know their integrity \\nand intelligence, who know whether they have the temperament to sit in \\njudgment of cases that will have enduring and irreparable ramifications \\nfor the litigants who appear in front of them.\\n  Respecting the blue-slip tradition ensures that when there is a \\nFederal judicial vacancy--for Connecticut, for example--that the \\nPresident nominate a qualified candidate from Connecticut with the \\nadvice and consent of Connecticut Senators. The same is true for the \\nPresiding Officer's home State of\\n\\n\\nTennessee or any of the other States involved here. I am sure my \\ncolleagues from Texas or North Carolina or wherever would want a \\nDemocratic President to consult them when making appointments to the \\ncourts that have jurisdiction over the people, the litigants, the folks \\nwho have to go to court with their grievances in their States. Blue \\nslips may be a courtesy, but they are important to the functioning of \\nour society.\\n\\n  Until the Trump administration, only five judges had ever been \\nconfirmed with only one blue slip in the last 100 years. That means one \\nSenator from that State objected. Only five went through with that one \\nobjection and with the other Senator saying OK.\\n  To our knowledge, no judge has ever been confirmed without having \\nboth blue slips from their home State Senators. Eric Miller would be a \\nfirst.\\n  Sometimes it is good to be a first but not so here. We are witnessing \\nanother norm being shattered in realtime. We need to know from the \\nmajority: Is this the road we really want to go down in this Chamber?\\n  I take my constitutional responsibilities very seriously, especially \\nwhen it comes to the confirmation of judges, as someone who has spent \\nmost of my professional career in the courtroom, either as a lawyer in \\nprivate practice or a U.S. attorney for Connecticut or as attorney \\ngeneral in my State for 20 years.\\n  This issue is important because not only is it a matter of courtesy, \\nbut it is a matter of completeness.\\n  This nomination is a stealth nomination in a very important sense, \\nalso, as far as the process for his confirmation is concerned. Only one \\nSenator--one Senator--has actually asked him questions on the record in \\npublic. That is because his confirmation hearing was scheduled at a \\ntime when only one Member of the U.S. Senate was there to ask him \\nquestions.\\n  It was held during a month-long recess in October. Only two members \\nof the committee--Senators Hatch and Crapo--could attend the hearing. \\nOnly Senator Crapo questioned Mr. Miller for a 5-minute round of \\nquestions.\\n  All 10 Democratic members of the Judiciary, including me, wrote to \\nSenator Grassley to have the hearing rescheduled. We asked, and he \\nrefused. We wrote Senator Grassley again to have a second hearing so \\nthat the full committee could provide advice and consent after \\nquestioning Mr. Miller's nomination. We had no success.\\n  If Mr. Miller is confirmed, he will have been questioned by that one \\nSenator, Mr. Crapo--out of 100--for a grand total of 5 minutes. That is \\nnot the way this system should work.\\n  I do take my constitutional responsibilities seriously. This process \\nmakes a sham of the obligations we all have a sworn duty to fulfill.\\n  In conclusion, let me say that in November of 2018, the Ninth Circuit \\nruled against the President. He described that case as ``a disgrace.'' \\nHe painted the ruling of the Ninth Circuit as biased by describing one \\nof the judges as an ``Obama judge.'' President Trump ultimately stated \\nthat the Ninth Circuit is ``not fair'' because every case the \\nadministration files in the Ninth Circuit results in a loss.\\n  He has made no secret of his frustration about judges generally, \\nwhether they were chosen by Republican or Democratic Presidents in the \\npast. He has made no secret of his contempt for judges who uphold the \\nrule of law and, as Chief Justice Roberts said, ``do equal right to \\nthose appearing before them.''\\n  Chief Justice Roberts also stated that an ``independent judiciary is \\nsomething we should all be thankful for.''\\n  The nomination of Eric Miller betrays that essential principle of the \\nAmerican judiciary. It diminishes and reduces the independence of our \\njudiciary at a level that we can ill afford and at a time when \\nindependence is most important. I think this nomination is particularly \\nobjectionable in light of that lack of independence.\\n  Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by the National Congress of \\nAmerican Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, Winnebago Tribe of \\nNebraska, and NARAL Pro-Choice America because of positions he has \\ntaken. Those positions are also objectionable to me, but what is most \\nimportant is his lack of independence, the lack of proper process in \\nhis confirmation, and his lack of qualifications for this job.\\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against him today.\\n  Thank you.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Mr. President, I am here joining my colleagues on the \\nfloor to sound the alarm because right now, this Senate is being \\nsteered down a very dangerous path. I spoke last night about this and \\nlaid out my case, and I am here again to make it one more time.\\n  Republican leaders are now barreling toward a confirmation vote on a \\nNinth Circuit nominee--a flashpoint that, if it succeeds, will mark a \\nmassive departure from the longstanding bipartisan process that has \\nbeen in place for generations. It is a bipartisan process that has \\nhelped this Senate put consensus nominees on the bench for as long as \\nwe have all been here. This is wrong, and it is the American people who \\nwe represent who will be hurt.\\n  Let's recap the facts. Neither I nor my colleague Senator Cantwell \\nreturned a blue slip on the nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the \\nNinth Circuit court. I have deep concerns about Mr. Miller's work \\nfighting against Tribes. Despite our objections, Republicans went ahead \\nwith Mr. Miller's confirmation hearing during a Senate recess when just \\ntwo Senators--both Republicans--were able to attend, and the hearing \\nincluded less than 5 minutes of questioning. It was a sham hearing. It \\nwas simply done to check the box.\\n  For this Senate to go ahead and confirm this Ninth Circuit court \\nnominee without the consent of or true input from both home State \\nSenators and after a sham hearing--that would be a dangerous first for \\nthis Senate.\\n  This is not a partisan issue; this is a question of this Senate's \\nability and commitment to properly review nominees.\\n  The only logical conclusion I can draw as to why we are here at these \\ncrossroads is that Republican leaders are hoping that most Americans \\nwon't notice, that they are doing everything in their power to pander \\nto President Trump and in doing that are trampling all over Senate \\nnorms in order to move our courts to the far right.\\n  We are standing here today because this is too important and because \\nthe short- and long-term consequences of letting any President \\nsteamroll the Senate on something as critical as our judicial nominees \\nare far too important.\\n  Abandoning the blue-slip process and instead bending to the will of a \\nPresident, by the way, who has demonstrated time and again his \\nignorance and disdain for the Constitution and rule of law is a \\nmistake. At a time when we have a President whose policies keep testing \\nthe limits of the law--from a ban on Muslims entering the United \\nStates, to a family separation policy at our southern border, to \\ndeclaring a national emergency without a real emergency--it is now more \\nimportant than ever that we have well-qualified, consensus judges on \\nthe bench.\\n  This new precedent of my Republican colleagues turning a blind eye to \\nthe blue slip and shunning longstanding bipartisan processes should \\nstop every one of my colleagues, Republican or Democratic, in their \\ntracks because today the two home State Senators left holding their \\nblue slips are me and my colleague Senator Cantwell, but in the future, \\nit could be any Member of this body. Today it is Washington State \\nfamilies who are getting cut out from an important process. It is their \\nconcerns about Eric Miller's long history of fighting against Tribal \\nrights that will be cast aside. But tomorrow it could be the concerns \\nof any of your constituents and any of your home States that get tossed \\naside for a President's crusade to reshape our courts and satisfy their \\npolitical base, and it could be your constituents and your home States \\nhurt by Senate leaders unwilling to stand up for norms and precedents \\nand our constitutional duty.\\n  Again, I am here today to urge my colleagues to truly think about \\nwhat moving ahead with this nomination means and to ask themselves, are \\nwe still able to work together in a bipartisan way and find common \\nground for the good of the country and the people we serve? Can we \\nstill even engage in a bipartisan process to find consensus candidates \\nto serve on our courts, or will our work in the Senate be reduced to \\npartisan extremes and political gamesmanship? Will Republicans accept \\nsimply being a rubberstamp for their leader in the White House? Will my \\ncolleagues be complicit in allowing our courts to be taken over by \\nideology alone, abandoning pragmatism and a commitment to justice for \\nall?

      "Pandas(Index=101, text=\"  Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge that we come together \\ntoday to defend the Constitution of the United States by repudiating \\nPresident Trump's emergency declaration of February 15.\\n  Few provisions of the Constitution are more plain than Article I, \\nSection 9, Clause 7: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but \\nin consequence of appropriations made by law.''\\n  The President has immense powers, but he cannot spend money unless \\nwe, the people's Representatives in Congress, have agreed that he can.\\n  Now, there might be extraordinary circumstances when a President \\ncould violate that principle, when all of us would agree that he must \\nact but there is no time to ask Congress for funds: a military invasion \\nor a massive natural disaster, for example. The National Emergencies \\nAct provides for that.\\n  But if the situation on the southern border were that kind of \\nemergency, then the President hasn't been acting like it. For 2 years, \\nwhen his party controlled the House and Senate, he never asked us for \\nmoney to build a wall, and if we truly faced that kind of imminent \\nthreat, a wall would not even be an emergency measure given how long it \\nwould take to build.\\n  The critical point is this: When the President finally got around to \\nasking us for money, we deliberated on his request, and we said no. You \\nmay believe we were right or you may believe we were wrong, but that is \\nwhat the elected Representatives of the American people decided.\\n  So the question before us today is not how do we secure the border; \\nit is whether this President or any President can use emergency powers \\nto defy the Congress when he disagrees with a\\n\\n\\ndecision that we have made. Are we going to stand by and watch this \\nPresident seize funds from the military to forcibly take land from law-\\nabiding American citizens to build something that Congress has said \\nshould not be built?\\n  We know this would be wrong. The National Emergencies Act is for \\ngenuine emergencies. It is not a get-out-of-the-Constitution-free card \\nfor Presidents who want something that Congress won't give them.\\n  Now, I have heard some people say that President Obama did the same \\nthing. I am sorry, he did not. Both President Obama and President Bush \\nwere sometimes accused of exceeding their constitutional authority; the \\ncourts sometimes overruled them. But neither Obama nor Bush nor Nixon \\nnor Reagan nor Roosevelt nor Lincoln nor any President since the \\nfounding of our Republic has ever decreed an emergency to spend money \\nthat the Congress explicitly denied them.\\n\\n  If you want to find a precedent for what President Trump has done, I \\ncan give you one. When I was a diplomat representing our country and \\nstanding up for our values around the world, I had this exact same \\ndebate with authoritarian governments in Ethiopia, in Bahrain, and in \\nEgypt, telling them: Do not use emergency powers to get around your \\nconstitutions. I never thought I would have that kind of argument with \\na President of the United States.\\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have been saying that America must \\nnot go the way of Venezuela, and they are right. When President Trump \\nsaid in his State of the Union that we must never become a socialist \\ncountry, I joined them in getting to my feet and applauding.\\n  But how do you think Venezuela got to be a socialist country? I will \\ntell you. President Maduro declared a state of economic emergency to \\ngive himself the power to defy his elected national assembly and spend \\nmoney however he pleased.\\n  That is not America. We must never become that. We believe in rule of \\nlaw, not rule by decree.\\n  We disagree passionately within the boundaries the Constitution \\ndraws, but we agree zealously to defend those boundaries when any one \\nof our party or any party tries to cross those boundaries. That is how \\nwe have survived as a constitutional democracy. It is the only way we \\ncan survive.\\n  We are divided enough right now, so, please, let's not allow another \\ntear in the constitutional fabric that holds us together.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \\nsupport for the Child Care for Working Families Act, which I was proud \\nto introduce earlier this afternoon with Senators Murray, Casey, and 30 \\nof our Senate colleagues.\\n  We know that investments in early childhood programs are foundational \\nfor future academic and social success. Yet child care remains \\nunaffordable for too many working families in the United States.\\n  For parents worried about how to pay for basic living expenses like \\nhousing, food, education, and transportation, increasing child care \\ncosts can place a heavy burden on family budgets.\\n  As a young immigrant from Japan who was raised by a single, working \\nmother, I understand the difficult decisions families have to make \\nevery day to survive. I have experienced these challenges firsthand. \\nYet, all these years later, for many Hawaii families, child care costs \\nexceed all other expenses besides housing.\\n  On average, Hawaii parents can expect to pay $8,280 per year, or $690 \\nper month, in child care expenses. These costs are 25 percent higher \\nthan they were just a decade ago, but wages have hardly kept pace. As a \\nresult, Hawaii families will dedicate around 11 percent of their family \\nbudget to child care--exceeding the government's standard for \\naffordable care.\\n  Unfortunately, even for families that can afford child care, finding \\nthat needed care may be difficult. This is because our early childhood \\neducators and child care workers are overworked and underpaid. In \\naddition, there is a severe need for more facilities to accommodate the \\nfamilies that need them. The need is great, and that is why the Child \\nCare for Working Families Act is so important. This legislation will \\nmake sure working families have access to high-quality, affordable \\nearly childhood programs.\\n  Specifically, the bill expands the existing Child Care and \\nDevelopment Block Grant program to guarantee that working and middle \\nclass families have access to affordable child care--ensuring that \\nthese families do not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income \\ntoward care, regardless of how many children they have.\\n  The bill also expands Head Start to promote universal preschool for \\nyoung children.\\n  Additionally, the bill also addresses the need to support our early \\nchildhood workers by making sure teachers, care givers, and other \\nworkers responsible for our children are fairly-compensated and fully-\\nsupported with training and professional development opportunities.\\n  These are the core provisions of the bill, which represents an \\nessential investment in the stability and prosperity of working \\nfamilies in Hawaii and across our Nation. Every family deserves access \\nto high-quality, affordable early childhood programs, and we will \\ncontinue fighting to make child care more affordable for all children.\\n  I thank my colleagues for their continued support in this effort, and \\nurge support for this important legislation.\\n\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Homeland Security & Immigration', 'Education'})\n",

With 25 charter \\nmembers, the club's mission was to encourage fellowship and civic \\nparticipation by local businessmen. Many prominent business leaders \\nwere part of that founding group, including Dr. Charles Holt, founder \\nof Holt Crock Clinic; Fagan Bourland, who served as the city's mayor \\nfor many years; and W.E. Harding, the founder of Harding Glass, one of \\nthe city's largest companies at the time.\\n  The club met for many years at the historic Goldman Hotel in downtown \\nFort Smith and, later, at the Ward Hotel on Garrison Avenue. Among its \\nearliest projects was supporting the Victory Loan Campaign designed to \\npay off debt from WWI. In the early days, it held festivals, hosted \\nfree concerts, and played an annual baseball game against the local \\nRotary Club.\\n  In addition to supporting local causes and providing a networking \\ntool for businessmen, the club's mission came into focus after Helen \\nKeller spoke at the Lions Club International convention in 1925. She \\nconcluded her speech by saying, ``I appeal to you Lions, you who have \\nyour sight, your hearing, you who are strong and brave and kind. Will \\nyou not constitute yourselves Knights of the Blind in this crusade \\nagainst darkness?'' Her eloquent plea transformed the Lions and made \\nsight conservation the organization's primary mission.\\n  Throughout its 100-year history, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has \\ncontributed greatly to this mission by raising money to provide eye \\nexams and glasses to local students and adults. Lions Club members have \\nalso collected thousands of pairs of glasses which are donated to the \\nSouthern College of Optometry in Memphis where students take the \\nglasses on international mission trips.\\n  In recent years, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has donated more than \\n$100,000 to help local residents with sight preservation and provided \\nsupport to many local children's organizations including the Fort Smith \\nBoys Club, Good Samaritan Clinic, Clearinghouse Backpack Program, \\nSpecial Olympics, and the Children's Emergency Shelter.\\n  In addition, the club has provided all of the equipment and support \\nneeded for the Safety Patrol program in the Fort Smith Public Schools \\nsince 1946.\\n  As an optometrist whose hometown is Fort Smith, AR, I am proud of the \\ngreat work done by this club and Lions chapters around the world.\\n  I congratulate the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club on its 100th \\nanniversary and hope that these Knights for the Blind continue to \\nprosper in their mission.\\n\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=121, text=\"  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss \\nthe issue that is facing Americans across the Nation: the opioids \\ncrisis.\\n  The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, a comprehensive guide \\npublished by the Drug Enforcement Administration, indicates that \\nillegal drug use continues to rise. It cites Mexican transnational \\ncriminal organizations as America's greatest enemy in the war against \\ndrugs. While these criminal organizations are bringing a wide variety \\nof illegal drugs across our southern border, I am particularly worried \\nabout their role in spreading the opioid crisis.\\n  Thousands of pounds of opioids are smuggled across our southern \\nborder every year. Just last year, the DEA seized more than 17,000 \\npounds of heroin in the United States. About 39 percent of this was \\nseized at the southern border.\\n  Another opioid that has devastated communities across America is \\nfentanyl. As we started to understand the scope of the opioid crisis \\nfacing our Nation, the CDC says doctors started prescribing less and \\nless pharmaceutical fentanyl. But fentanyl overdoses remained steady as \\nprescription rates dropped, meaning that illicitly manufactured \\nfentanyl is one of the main drivers of the opioid crisis.\\n  Illicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is produced in China and \\nMexico. It is either smuggled into the United States through the mail \\nfrom China or across our southern border from Mexico. In 2017, Customs \\nand Border Patrol agents seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl at the \\nborder. Considering fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than \\nmorphine, last year's seizures accounted for millions of potential \\noverdoses and deaths.\\n  But it is easy to discuss the amount of illegal drugs that have been \\nseized at the border. It is easy to discuss the need for change. The \\nhardest part is discussing the human toll that this crisis has taken.\\n  Madam Speaker, last year more Americans died of a drug overdose than \\nin any other recorded year. In 2017, overdoses killed more than 70,000 \\nAmericans, and more than 28,000 of these deaths were related to \\nsynthetic opioids such as fentanyl.\\n  Our country is facing a crisis, and action is necessary. That is why \\nI was proud to stand with President Trump and support H.J. Res. 31. \\nThis appropriations bill included provisions that are vital to my \\ncongressional district and that will bring the fight against opioids to \\nthe front lines: the southern border.\\n  Although I was disappointed that my Democratic colleagues didn't \\ninclude more to combat this crisis, I was pleased that it included \\nfunding for 55 miles of wall on the southern border. Walls work, and we \\nneed to continue the construction of this wall. This is why President \\nTrump's national emergency declaration is necessary.\\n  But, Madam Speaker, tomorrow House Democrats will bring up a measure \\nto block President Trump's emergency declaration, H.J. Res. 46. They \\nsay the wall is immoral. They say it is cruel. I say we need decisive \\naction to fight the opioid crisis, and this is the first step in the \\nright direction.\\n  Since President Carter, there have been 31 national emergencies \\ndeclared. President Clinton declared 6, and President Obama declared 10 \\nthat are still in place. All 31 national emergencies recognized a dire \\nthreat to the American people and took action. By declaring this \\nnational emergency, President Trump is taking action against a threat \\nthat killed 70,000 Americans in 2017 alone.\\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J.

Federal spending as a \\npercentage of gross domestic product was 17.5 percent. Today, the total \\nnational debt now exceeds $22 trillion.\\n  The last balanced budget was signed into law in 1997, and the \\nCongressional Budget Office projects that Federal spending as a \\npercentage of GDP is projected to be 20.8 percent this year.

This is just 18 years, starting from 2010 and going to 2028. \\nThis is the interest payment on our national debt because, Madam \\nSpeaker, like every American knows, if you borrow money, you have to \\npay interest on it.\\n\\n\\n  The fact of the matter is that right now, our interest, total \\ninterest payment, is about $200 billion.\\n  But, Madam Speaker, every American family knows, every senior who has \\nsaved for retirement knows that interest rates right now are very low. \\nIf you go and get a CD, what are you getting, a 1 percent, 2 percent \\nreturn. Those interest rates will return to normal.\\n  And as the gentleman from Texas mentioned, we are accruing debt at $1 \\ntrillion a year, so that by the time we reach 2028, the interest \\npayment on our debt alone, due to the increased size of our debt and \\nthe increased interest rate is going to approach $1 trillion a year.\\n  Now, what does that mean?\\n  Well, Madam Speaker, there are a lot of things that the government \\nfunds. Those of you who are interested in the safety of Social \\nSecurity, of Medicare and Medicaid, of Federal pensions, they know that \\nwe are approaching a zero sum game. We can't keep this debt going \\nforever.\\n  In fact, this final chart I am going to show is 10 years, starting \\nnow, it shows the percent spending of GDP, so relative to our economy, \\nwhat our net interest on our debt is; and then other things, like \\nMedicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, things that we think \\nare important, defense. The yellow line, the defense budget, \\nnondefense, discretionary spending, all these are relatively constant. \\nAll of them are going to be crowded out by net interest on the debt.\\n  Madam Speaker, Americans understand, you can't borrow forever. You \\ncan't do it on your cars; you can't do it on your houses; you can't do \\nit on your credit cards; and we can't do it here in Congress anymore. \\nThis threatens our security, when, in 5 years, we will pay more \\ninterest on our national debt than we pay defending this country. We \\ncan't do it.\\n  Congress has to get its act together, clean up its act, and get our \\nbudget in balance.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=150, text=\"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \\nCline), for his comments and his efforts and his willingness to stand \\non this important issue and recognizing--and promising to people and \\nresponding to that promise; because I can tell you, when I first \\nconsidered even running for Congress, one of the things that motivated \\nme was this horrific debt, which I have watched explode even more since \\nI got here; not because I am here, but in spite of my efforts.\\n  So, today, we are preparing to introduce our resolution, which will \\nbe later this week, Senator Perdue, his cosponsors, my 50 original \\ncosponsors--more than 50 original cosponsors. And we recognize that, as \\nof today, the national debt is more than $22 trillion. You have heard \\nthat. Can you hear it enough without taking action?\\n  The resulting total interest expense for the fiscal year 2019 is $192 \\nbillion. $192 billion. Interest does not sleep. It doesn't take a \\nholiday; it doesn't take a vacation. Interest accumulates without \\nceasing until you pay your debt.\\n  Our national debt as a percentage of GDP is 104 percent. The last \\ntime a Federal budget was balanced and was signed was 1997.\\n  Our total Federal tax receipts for fiscal year 2018 were $3.329 \\ntrillion. But somehow--and we all know how--our Federal outlays totaled \\n$4.1 trillion, with a deficit of $780 billion. And we know how. We know \\nhow that happened. We look to each other in this body.\\n  Since the last time Congress balanced the Federal budget in 1997, \\nCongress has failed to maintain a fiscally-responsible budget and has \\nrelied on raising the debt ceiling. How many times have we raised the \\ndebt ceiling? It is almost more than you can count.\\n  Congress failed to pass a balanced budget for fiscal year 2019 and \\nfailed to restore regular order to the legislative process by not \\nallowing Representatives to offer and debate amendments. When we have \\nregular order, it permits the House to separately debate and adopt all \\nappropriation bills in a timely fashion and facilitates congressional \\noversight on Federal spending.\\n  Estimates are Medicare will run out of money in 2026, Social Security \\nin 2034.\\n  As my friend from Virginia, Mr. Cline, said: Congress' \\nineffectiveness has caused the U.S. credit rating from Standard & \\nPoor's to drop from AAA to AA+. Without a targeted effort to balance \\nthe Federal budget, our credit will surely continue to fall.\\n  President Trump's National Security Strategy highlights the need to \\nreduce the national debt through fiscal responsibility.\\n  Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned that: ``Any nation \\nthat can't keep its fiscal house in order eventually cannot maintain \\nits military power.''\\n  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that: ``Our \\ncontinued plunge into debt is unsustainable and represents a dire \\nfuture threat to our economy and to our national security.''\\n  Former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck \\nHagel warned: ``Increase in the debt will, in the absence of a \\ncomprehensive budget that addresses both entitlements and revenues, \\nforce even deeper reductions in our national security capabilities.''\\n  And former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen \\nwarned: ``I believe the single biggest threat to our national security \\nis debt.''\\n  And so what must the House do?\\n  First, we have to recognize that the national debt is, indeed, a \\nthreat to our national security. We must realize that deficits are \\nunsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous.\\n\\n\\n  We must restore regular order in the appropriations process, and we \\nmust commit to addressing the fiscal crisis faced by the United States.\\n  I mentioned it before, but when you are spending a pot of money and \\nyou have limited resources, regardless of how great those resources \\nare--I mean, we have had record tax revenue for the last 14 months, \\nrecord revenue, more than any time in the history of the United States \\nof America, and we still outspend that revenue.\\n\\n\\n  As we do so, we have to borrow money, because we have created a \\nstructural deficit. So, foundationally, we put ourselves in a position \\nwhere we have to borrow money; and when you have to borrow money, you \\nhave to pay interest. As you have to borrow more money, which we do, \\nyou are going to start crowding out what you can spend those limited \\nresources on.\\n  Who holds our debt? One of the biggest holders of our debt is also \\none of our greatest potential adversaries, and that is China. China has \\nbeen, for the last 25 years, expanding their military, building a blue-\\nwater navy, expanding their capacity for rockets and missiles, and also \\ntaking in our debt.\\n  This places us at risk if we are ever in a conflict, which I pray we \\nnever are. I hope we never are. But if we are in a conflict with an \\nadversary who holds significant amounts of our national debt, we are at \\nrisk. And you have to acknowledge that.\\n  What has helped us out so far is the fact that the U.S. dollar is the \\ninternational medium of exchange in international transactions, \\neconomic transactions. If we were to lose that, the ability to borrow \\nfunds to sustain our unsustainable spending would go away. And I bring \\nthat back to China.\\n  China has ambitions to make its own currency a regional currency of \\nexchange. They would like to replace the United States dollar as the \\ninternational medium of exchange as well.\\n  What else is an actual physical problem when you have the kind of \\ndebt and deficit spending that we have is that you cannot pay to \\nreplace and maintain your internal infrastructure, and we see that \\ntoday. Bridges, roads, airports, all of these need maintenance. They \\nneed upkeep. They need expansion. We need new roads. We need new \\nhighways, but we can't pay for it, because we are going to be in a \\nposition of being overextended. That places us at risk, because you do \\nneed internal infrastructure.\\n  Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to my good friend, the \\ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care', 'Social Security & Tax Reform'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=151, text=\"  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. \\nBiggs from Arizona, for yielding. This is such an important topic that \\nwe are talking about, national debt.\\n  I remember when I came to Congress in 2013, Admiral Mullen said that \\nthe biggest threat to America is our national debt. Hillary Clinton, \\nSecretary of State at the time, said she agreed with that. One of the \\nfew times I have agreed with Mrs. Clinton.\\n  But national debt today is $22 trillion. When I came into Congress, \\nit was $14.5 trillion. When President Reagan left office, it was about \\n$2.5 trillion. It doesn't matter who is in the White House. Our debt is \\ngoing up until this body, Congress, addresses our debt.\\n  If you do a pie chart of our debt, 71 percent of our debt is \\nmandatory spending, 29 percent is discretionary. Discretionary was \\ndescribed to me as the money we have left over at the end of the month \\nafter we pay all of our bills. That is discretionary.\\n  The interesting thing is, in 1964, those numbers were reversed. \\nMandatory spending was 29 percent, discretionary was 71 percent. So we \\nwere a cash-rich Nation. We could do things. We could do a space \\nprogram. We could do the infrastructure bills that we did that this \\nNation needed.\\n  Today, that is flipped around to where 71 percent of every dollar \\nthis government takes in is already spent. We don't vote on that in \\nCongress. Those are things that happen without us. The only things we \\nvote and we shut the government down on is that 29 percent.\\n  If we do not address our mandatory spending, mandatory spending will \\naddress us as a Nation.\\n  I was on an interview, and they said, well, President Obama doesn't \\nwant to mess with mandatory spending, which is Social Security, \\nMedicare, Medicaid, interest on our debt, retirement programs for our \\nFederal employees. And I reminded the interviewer, and they said this \\nabout President Trump: He doesn't want to deal with mandatory spending.\\n  I said: I understand that. But either this President or the next \\nPresident deals with mandatory spending or mandatory spending will \\ndictate to this Nation what we have to cut, and those are called \\nausterity measures.\\n  All you have to do is look at Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, Greece, \\nwhere they had mandatory austerity measures where programs were cut, \\nand they were cut by other governments that controlled their debt.\\n  Today, about 30 percent of our debt is controlled by foreign nations, \\nthe other 70 percent, the American taxpayer owns, but it would be \\ntragic to allow us in this body to allow another nation to say: You \\nhave got to get rid of that program.\\n  That is unconscionable. It is irresponsible of us. And if we do not \\ndeal with that debt, that debt will deal with us.\\n  Madam Speaker, this is something I appreciate Mr. Biggs standing up \\nand having this Special Order on. This is something we talk about \\nrepeatedly in our district. We have town halls on this.\\n  When you look at the discretionary spending, that is the stuff that \\nruns all of government outside of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \\nthe retirement programs. That means the Department of Defense. That \\nmeans the Department of Education, Justice, the Department of Homeland \\nSecurity. All the research money that goes into our research \\nuniversities comes out of the discretionary funding of government.\\n  I am telling you, as a Nation, if we do not address this, this Nation \\nwill not survive, and history will repeat itself from great countries \\nthat have lasted for a period of time. They have always come to a \\ndemise, and it was because they haven't paid attention to the things \\nthat are the very basic.\\n\\n  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague for bringing this up. This \\nis something that repeatedly--if you look at this Congress, the \\nDemocrats have been in charge of the House since January 2 or 3. We \\ndon't have a budget. We haven't addressed anything dealing with debt. \\nBut they have spent a lot of time dealing with President Trump and \\ntrying to remove him from office and finding out reasons why he \\nshouldn't be the President. Madam Speaker, we as Americans need to come \\ntogether and deal with the debt, and I appreciate the gentleman's \\nefforts.\", cat_list={'Social Security & Tax Reform', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=154, text=\"  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.\\n  Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time from the gentleman from Florida, \\nwhen we look at that and the promises constantly, this is getting to my \\npoint: The process needs to get back to regular order. It needs to get \\nback to 12 individual bills--this is what we talked about--12 \\nindividual bills that go through a process where there is debate; there \\nare amendments; there is discussion; and there is accountability.\\n  Nothing provides more accountability than bills that have single \\nsubjects; nothing provides more transparency than bills that have \\nsingle subjects; and nothing allows the American people to see what we \\nare doing in Congress like single subjects.\\n  So when you take 12 subjects, which are your budget bills, and you \\ncombine 3 or 4 of them into a minibus and 6 or 7 into an omnibus, and \\nyou say vote on these things--usually we are given just a short period \\nof time to read those things and analyze them anyway; usually they come \\nin under some closed rule or some highly structured rule--well, you are \\npreventing a couple of things:\\n  Number one, we are not going to get to a balanced budget because, \\nultimately, what you are also preventing is accountability, because \\nwhen the American people can see how you voted in a single area on a \\nsingle issue, they know whether they agree with you or not. They know \\nwhether you should be doing that, and they will let you know. They give \\nyou the feedback. That is the accountability that we need if we are \\ngoing to balance this budget over time and correct our course.\\n  Now, there is an economic theory called path dependence. Sometimes it \\nis called increasing returns. Kenneth Arrow wrote a lot about this, and \\nwhat it boils down to is this: It is an analysis, really, of why \\ndecisionmakers make suboptimum decisions and then persist on the course \\neven after they know it is a suboptimum decision.\\n  Well, what typically happens is regimes and institutions are built \\nup. There is feedback, and people will persist on that because they are \\nbuilding up regimes and institutions; and, ultimately, they have \\npropelled themselves so far down, they are what we call locked in. To \\nexit that path, the cost is so high that they don't want to exit that \\nsuboptimal path and move to a more optimal path.\\n  But I am here to tell you tonight that as long as we stay on this \\nsuboptimal path where we don't have these 12 budget bills, we don't get \\nback to regular order in budgeting, as long as we do CRs and then claim \\nthat we have done a normal budgeting path when we have created \\ncromnibus bills or omnibus bills or minibus bills, we are not going to \\nbe able to exit the path that we are on.\\n  If we are going to sustain this Nation, we are going to need to exit \\nthe path that we are on and move to a more optimal path.\\n\\n\\n  That is really what this resolution is about. It is encouraging \\npeople from both sides of the aisle. I am not blaming one side or the \\nother. I am just saying that if we are going to get this done, \\neverybody in this House has to look internally. Everybody in this House \\nneeds to say: What are we doing with our process? Everybody needs to \\nrecognize that if we continue on this path, at some point there is no \\nmore path to run down.\\n  We just heard from a series of speakers that the numbers go up and, \\nat some point, you reach a tipping point, and that tipping point says \\nyou cannot go forward. I would rather we move over to a suboptimal path \\nnow and pay that price, which is typically a short-term, corrective \\nprice. In the scheme of things, it may take longer than just a short-\\nterm, but we have to move over because, if we don't, our choices are \\ntaken away from us.\\n  I will tell you that if we would have gotten on the path 2 years ago, \\nwe would have had more choices and more options. Every day we go \\nfurther down this path, the fewer options we have until the end. Mr. \\nYoho is correct, and all of my friends who have spoken tonight were \\ncorrect, and the more than 50 cosponsors here, they are all correct: If \\nwe don't do something, it will be imposed upon us.\\n  If it is imposed upon us, we won't have control. We will not be able \\nto handle this in a way where we hurt the fewest people, where we can \\nfeather the landing as much as possible, where we can maintain our \\neconomic status, where people can still find jobs, and where people can \\nachieve the American Dream that they perceive that they want to \\nachieve. Those things get taken away from us because, ultimately, this \\ncountry is built on individual freedom and individual accountability.\\n  If we have to take that horrible measure of receiving something like \\nour debts being called in, or we can't find lenders, or the cost of our \\nloans--imagine if the cost of our debt today would just move up a \\ncouple of points--imagine what that would look like. If we can't do \\nthis of our own volition, we will be subject to someone else's will and \\nthe very essence of the American Dream--individual freedom and \\nindividual accountability--will go away. And why? Because that \\naccountability will be foisted upon us by coercive forces.\\n  Madam Speaker, I conclude tonight with gratitude to the 50-some-odd \\nmen and women who have signed on to this resolution. I implore all in \\nthis body to join myself, to join me, to join Senator Perdue and those \\nwho have signed on and sponsored a companion resolution in the Senate, \\nand let's make the hard choices today so that we might preserve the \\nfreedoms for our children and grandchildren.\\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Madam Speaker, I rise today because, on February 24, \\nColorado and our Nation lost a fierce and fearless advocate, Carrie Ann \\nLucas of Windsor, Colorado.\\n  A mother, an activist, and an attorney, Carrie practiced family law \\nto prevent discrimination against parents with disabilities. She \\nadopted four children, and her accomplishments centered on her \\ndedication to them. All her children have significant disabilities, and \\nCarrie always ensured that they were loved, respected, and supported in \\ntheir individual hopes and dreams.\\n  Carrie devoted so much to ensuring her wisdom never stayed with just \\nher but was shared throughout the disability rights community, the \\nlegal world, and our Nation. She spoke out strongly and protested each \\nday for the rights of people with disabilities to comprehensive \\nhealthcare with dignity and respect.\\n  It is a permanent scar on our Nation that Carrie was lost to the \\nrefusal of an insurance company to cover one particular medication, \\nwhich led to escalating health issues and, eventually, her premature \\ndeath.\\n  Carrie's activism knew only the bounds of freedom and of justice. She \\nwas ceaselessly bold, brave, and selfless.\\n  My thoughts are with her family, and I pray that this body will gain \\nsome of the bravery that never faltered in her and use it as an \\ninspiration to ensure that no American goes without healthcare--ever.\\n  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the obituary of Carrie Ann \\nLucas.\\n\\n                      Obituary for Carrie A. Lucas\\n\\n       The disability community lost one of its fiercest advocates \\n     on 2/24/19. Carrie Ann Lucas, a disability rights attorney \\n     who pioneered representation for parents with disabilities, \\n     died after an arbitrary denial from an insurance company \\n     caused a plethora of health problems, exacerbating her \\n     disabilities and eventually leading to her premature death. \\n     She was 47 years old.\\n       Carrie Ann Lucas is known around the state and the country \\n     for her strong advocacy.\\n       Carrie Ann grew up in Windsor, Colorado, and had several \\n     careers including being a teacher, ordained minister and \\n     legal assistant before becoming an attorney. Carrie graduated \\n     from Whitworth College in 1994, traveled and taught in \\n     Saipan, and then returned to the states to attend the Iliff \\n     School of Theology. She received a Master's of Divinity with \\n     Justice and Peace Concentration from Iliff in 1999, but \\n     during her time there, became increasingly involved in \\n     disability advocacy. After she graduated, she started working \\n     as an advocate and later legal assistant for the Colorado \\n     Cross-Disability Coalition, investigating, preparing, and \\n     monitoring disability rights cases and providing informal \\n     advocacy on a wide range of topics. While there, she was \\n     granted a full scholarship as a Chancellor's Scholar at the \\n     University of Denver School of Law.\\n       Following her graduation from law school in 2005, she was \\n     awarded a prestigious Equal Justice Works fellowship to \\n     create a program to combat discrimination that impacts \\n     parenting for parents with disabilities. This program, \\n     initially started within the Colorado Cross-Disability \\n     Coalition, spun off to be Disabled Parents Rights, one of the \\n     only organizations in the country devoted to this issue. She \\n     also became a national expert and trainer on the rights of \\n     parents with disabilities and, through her legal advocacy, \\n     secured decisions upholding and promoting those rights here \\n     in Colorado. Most recently she was recruited by the Colorado \\n     Office of Respondent Parents Counsel to help set up a program \\n     to train other lawyers around the state to replicate the sort \\n     of impact she was making.\\n       In addition to these professional activities, Ms. Lucas was \\n     an advocate with the disability rights groups ADAPT and Not \\n     Dead Yet, speaking, teaching, writing, testifying, and \\n     protesting on disability justice and the rights of people \\n     with disabilities to healthcare and respect. She was also a \\n     talented photographer and cook. Carrie Ann was an activist at \\n     heart. She graduated from EMERGE, ran for Windsor City \\n     Council in 2017, and was planning on additional political \\n     activity. She was chair of Colorado Democrats with \\n     Disabilities for the past several years. She was a member of \\n     the ADAPT group that protested in Cory Gardner's office and \\n     got arrested to help save the Affordable Care Act in 2017, \\n     particularly Medicaid. She served on the Board of Directors \\n     of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. She was \\n     active with Not Dead Yet and fought hard against physician \\n     assisted suicide and the notion that life with a disability \\n     is not worth living. She demonstrated every day how amazing \\n     life with a disability can be. She was given the \\n     Intersectionality Award from The Civil Rights Education and \\n     Enforcement Center in 2016. She was a leader in passing HB \\n     18-1104 which changed Colorado law to make sure that \\n     disability was no longer a reason to remove a child from a \\n     parental home. There is much, much more.\\n       Carrie became a lawyer to practice family law after lived \\n     experience of discrimination against parents with \\n     disabilities firsthand. In 1998 fostered and later adopted \\n     her oldest daughter, Heather Lucas. Heather has significant \\n     developmental disabilities and was languishing in another \\n     state. She fostered and was preparing to adopt a second \\n     child, but that was disrupted due to prejudice against \\n     parents with disabilities. Where most people might be upset \\n     and feel helpless, Carrie Ann was furious and went to law \\n     school to represent parents with disabilities.\\n       Carrie adopted three more children over the years, Adrianne \\n     Lucas, Azisa Lucas and Anthony Lucas. All of her \\n     accomplishments centered on her dedication to her children \\n     and her role as a mother. All of her children have \\n     significant disabilities and Carrie Ann always made sure that \\n     they were not only educated and included in their \\n     communities, but that they were loved, respected, and \\n     supported in their individual hopes and dreams.\\n       Carrie had a severe neuromuscular disease, a rare form of \\n     muscular dystrophy. She relied on a power wheelchair, and had \\n     used a ventilator for years. However, her death was premature \\n     and caused by inappropriate and brutal cost containment \\n     procedures of an insurance company. Because Carrie Ann worked \\n     for the state, she had use state insurance which was primary \\n     ahead of her Medicare and Medicaid.

It is good to know that you respect \\nwhat we do upstairs as much as the members of the committee do.\\n  I always enjoy coming down for the Rules Committee debate, because it \\nis the only debate on all of Capitol Hill where the Reading Clerk reads \\nevery single word of the bill that we are about to consider. \\nOrdinarily, we waive that, but the rules don't let you waive it. You \\nhave to read the rule so folks will understand what is happening today.\\n  I happened to time the Reading Clerk today. I didn't put him up to \\nanything special. He read as he always does. It took him 1 minute and 6 \\nseconds to read the resolution that is before us.\\n  I heard my friend from California talk about the important \\nconstitutional questions that are here before us today. I heard my \\nfriend from California equate our President to discredited despots \\naround the globe and how we must stand up to prevent that behavior here \\nin America. I heard my colleagues who took to the floor this morning \\nfor 1 minutes be sanctioned by the Chair and advised to cease engaging \\nin arguments of personality and attacks against our President.\\n  One minute and 6 seconds it took to read the resolution before us \\ntoday, Mr. Speaker, and that is 1 minute and 6 seconds longer than this \\nresolution has been considered in total in every committee throughout \\nthis Capitol.\\n  I want to say that again. You heard my colleague talk about how \\ncritically important this resolution of disapproval is as it relates to \\nour constitutional powers. You heard it described as a power grab \\nequivalent to those of discredited despots. And we haven't talked about \\nit at all in this Chamber. In committees, not one witness has \\ntestified.\\n  One minute and 6 seconds is how much we have invested in these \\nnationally important matters.\\n  I listened, Mr. Speaker, as you cautioned Member after Member to \\ncease engaging in personal attacks on the President during their 1 \\nminutes this morning. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that that is exactly \\nwhat we are doing here today.\\n  If you want to have a debate about Article I and Article II powers \\nand how we ought to retrieve the power that has slid down Pennsylvania \\nAvenue through administration after administration after \\nadministration, I am not just your willing partner, I am your \\nenthusiastic partner and passionate advocate. But that is not the bill \\nwe have before us today. It is not the debate we are going to have \\ntoday.\\n  This is another in a long string of measures that have been brought \\nto the floor of this House that could have been brought in a bipartisan \\nway. I don't mean one Republican; I don't mean two Republicans; I mean \\nthe majority of Democrats and the majority of Republicans standing \\ntogether to speak with one voice on behalf of the American people. But \\ntime and time again, we are missing that opportunity.\\n  This isn't a constitutional issue today, Mr. Speaker, though you \\nwould not know that, because we have not had any witnesses testify. \\nThis is a legislative issue before us today.\\n  There is, in fact, a National Emergencies Act that allows the \\nPresident to do extraordinary things if he or she decides there is a \\nnational emergency. That is not unconstitutional. Congress passed the \\nNational Emergencies Act; the President signed the National Emergencies \\nAct. Perhaps the Supreme Court one day will decide that was an \\nunconstitutional delegation of power by the Congress, but the Congress \\ndelegated that power in the National Emergencies Act.\\n  The way we talk about this issue, Mr. Speaker, you would think this \\nis the first time you and I have seen this in the few years we have \\nbeen in Congress. Of course, you and I know that is nonsense.\\n  There are 31 other national emergency declarations in effect today--\\n31 other national emergency declarations. National emergency \\ndeclarations from the Obama administration are still active today.\\n  If we are so concerned about Article I and Article II power grabs, \\nperhaps these emergency declarations that have been on the books since \\nthe last administration, Congress should deal with those affirmatively \\nhere on the floor.\\n  There are national emergency declarations still in effect from the \\nBush administration. There are national emergencies still in effect \\nfrom the Clinton administration. Mr. Speaker, there are national \\nemergencies still in effect from the Carter administration. This House \\nhas made not a single effort to draw back that power from 1600 \\nPennsylvania Avenue.\\n  Those are legitimate questions. Those are important questions. Those \\nare things that bring us together as the people's representatives in \\nthis House, not bills designed just to poke a stick at a President who \\nhas real passion and real conviction about issues of real importance.\\n  Do you know what is in this resolution today, Mr. Speaker, what is in \\nthis disapproval resolution today, that will make a difference on the \\nborder in terms of ending human trafficking? Not one thing.\\n  Do you know what is in this resolution today that, if we come \\ntogether to pass, will make a difference in terms of drug trafficking \\non the border? Not one thing.\\n\\n  What about if we come together to pass this resolution today for the \\nvery serious issue of weapons trafficking across our border? Do you \\nknow what we will do today to fix that? Not one thing.\\n  Victims of sexual assault as they are being trafficked into this \\ncountry, do you know what we are going to do to fix that today? Not one \\nthing.\\n  Do you know how many Dreamers are going to have their hopes realized \\ntoday with a pathway to permanency here in the United States of \\nAmerica? Not one.\\n  Man, we are good at bringing issues that are designed to poke each \\nother in the eye. We are so good at bringing issues designed to try to \\nembarrass one and boost another. But I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, \\nwe are not so great with actually solving real problems.\\n  For the first time in my congressional career just last Congress, Mr. \\nSpeaker, we brought a bill to the floor that would have provided \\npermanency\\n\\n\\nfor our Dreamers and that would have provided solutions on our border \\nfor human trafficking, for weapons trafficking, and for drug \\ntrafficking. You know how many Democratic votes we got on that bill, \\nMr. Speaker? Not one.\\n  Now, to be fair, it wasn't one bill; it was two bills. Folks said, \\nhey, if this one is not the right one, let's bring another one. Maybe \\nthis is going to bring people together.\\n  Do you know how many votes we got on the second bill, Mr. Speaker, \\nfrom the other side of the aisle? Not one. The only bills that have \\ncome to the floor to provide a pathway for Dreamers in my 8 years in \\nCongress, and we got not one vote from the other side the aisle.\\n  Is that because the other side of the aisle doesn't believe in those \\nsolutions? No, that is not why. It is because the other side of the \\naisle, in its wisdom, deemed that to be a resolution not designed to \\nsupport the Dreamers, but designed to divide. I disagree with that \\nconclusion, but that is the conclusion that was made. Thus, the only \\nopportunity in a decade we have had to support Dreamers, not one \\nDemocrat stood up and said yes.\\n  I call that a failed opportunity, and I am not interested in figuring \\nout who is to blame for that failed opportunity.\\n  This is a failed opportunity today, too, Mr. Speaker. Sadly, it is \\nanother in a series of failed opportunities here in 2019.\\n  I believe my colleagues are going to see through the divisiveness of \\nthis resolution, through the charade of constitutionalism right down to \\nthe very core of partisanism that underlies this resolution.\\n  But just remember, 1 minute and 6 seconds, Mr. Speaker. Before I took \\nto the microphone today, 1 minute and 6 seconds from the Reading Clerk \\nis all the time this new Congress has dedicated to an issue that you \\nare going to hear from my colleagues again and again is one of critical \\nnational importance, international importance, constitutional \\nimportance.

Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from \\nCalifornia for her astuteness, and, certainly, the manager of this \\nlegislation, and our friends on the other side of the aisle.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I simply want to try to craft the importance of H.J. \\nRes. 46 that we will ultimately be debating today. As an original \\ncosponsor, I was quick to try to bring order and to recognize the \\nimportance of the Constitution.\\n  Clearly, the statute might be interpreted to be used in a reckless \\nmanner. But it is precise in that it deals with the necessity of \\nbuilding military construction and other matters in the course of war \\nthat are an emergency.\\n  It might even cover rising gun violence, the fact that we have more \\nguns in the United States than we have citizens.\\n  It might be that if there was a pending war on the southern border, \\none might determine that that is the case.\\n  It might be that, in 2001, the first sense of terrorism came when an \\nindividual crossed the northern border to attack the United States. If \\nthat had continued with throngs of terrorists coming across the \\nnorthern border, the President then might have declared a national \\nemergency.\\n  But we do not have that, Mr. Speaker. What we have is a person's \\ndesire.\\n  We understand that the apprehensions at the southern border have \\nactually gone down. The combined 521,000 apprehensions for border and \\nCustoms agents for fiscal year 2018 was 32,288 apprehensions fewer.\\n  Those who are coming across the border in the last 6 to 8 months are \\ncoming across as mothers and children fleeing the catastrophe of \\nbloodshed in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. These are people \\ndesperate for help. They are coming through legal ports of entry.\\n  How do I know that? I have stood and watched them come. I have spoken \\nto a mother whose baby was 45 days old. She had birthed on her road \\nhere, not because she just wanted a vacation, but because they had \\ncommitted to decapitating her if she did not leave town immediately, \\nmeaning leave one of the countries. It was my plea that got her to be \\nable to go to a hospital. I held little Roger in my hands, who is 9 \\nmonths old. He had been separated at the border from his family.\\n  These are the issues that are being addressed at the border. There is \\nno catastrophe.\\n  Let me be very clear, as my friends always cite illegal immigration, \\nI want to make sure that any criminal, no matter who they are, who does \\nany injury to anyone in the United States, count me as standing on the \\nside of bringing that person to justice. But that is not what is \\nhappening at the border.\\n\\n\\n  Therefore, I would ask the administration to attend themselves to the \\nConstitution, to recognize the difficulty or the wrongness of \\ndistorting the purposes of the United States Congress, the House, that \\nhas the purse strings by calling it a national emergency. My God, if we \\nwere to have one, would this Nation even understand how to implement it \\nbecause they are hearing it being declared in a very foolish way?\\n  I conclude by simply saying that 58 people in national security, Mr. \\nSpeaker--58 of them--have indicated this is wrongheaded and jeopardizes \\nour national security.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for the resolution that I \\nhave cosponsored, H.J.

I am \\nshocked that there are prominent American legislators who believe in \\ndenying babies lifesaving medical care when they are born.\\n  As a mother, a grandmother, a legislator, and an advocate who came to \\nCongress to serve as a voice for the voiceless, I believe that life \\nbegins at conception and that it is wrong to kill a child no matter how \\nmany weeks old he or she may be.

Last year, Republicans gave him $25 \\nbillion if they read the bill, but I actually brought it to their \\nattention on the floor that the bill actually read $75 billion that \\nthey were allocating for a border wall. The facts didn't matter then \\nfor one side of the aisle.\\n  The President himself said it. ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd \\nrather do it much faster.'' That is not an emergency. I was a 911 \\nemergency dispatcher for 17.5 years. I can cite many examples of what \\nan emergency is. Building a wall much faster is not an emergency. That \\nis political theater. That is political posturing for 2020.\\n  Where is the President stealing this money from? Certainly, he is not \\ngetting it from Mexico as he promised. Mexico said ``no.'' The \\nPresident is stealing $2.5 billion that Congress approved to combat \\nillegal drug activities around the world.\\n  I know that my colleagues believe that fighting international drug \\norganizations is important. I know this because I traveled with \\nRepublicans and Democrats to the jungles in South America. We talked \\nabout eradication of narcotrafficking.\\n  What about the $3.6 billion that the President is stealing from \\nmilitary construction? A study earlier this year found that 16 percent \\nof military families had a positive view of their base housing. That \\nmeans 55 percent had a negative one.\\n  Many families reported unsafe conditions, including lead-based paint, \\nrampant mold, exposed asbestos, faulty electrical wiring, vermin \\ninfestations, and gas leaks. Is that not an emergency? Is that not \\nworthy of the bipartisan vote that we took to allocate that money so \\nthat they can make those fixes?\\n  I know my Republican colleagues support military families. I know \\nthat because I have traveled with them to Afghanistan. I have traveled \\nwith them to other countries. I know that this is wrong. This so-called \\nnational emergency is wrong, and I know my colleagues know that this is \\nwrong too. This is undemocratic.

Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency \\nissued by the President on February 15, 2019.\\n  The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the \\npetulant

taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that \\n``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''\\n  In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling \\ndata available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's \\nnational emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.\\n  The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every \\nregion of the country, by every income group and education category.\\n  National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous \\nin their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not \\nconstitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former \\nRepublican senators and Members of Congress.\\n  They understand that after failing to convince the American people or \\nCongress to pay for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion \\ndollar concrete wall, the President has now embarked on a course of \\nconduct that is deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks \\nand balances wisely established by the Framers and which has served \\nthis nation and the world so well for nearly 250 years.\\n  Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the \\nconstitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate \\n11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency \\ndeclaration that contravenes the will of the American people and \\nnegates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the \\nCongress of the United States.\\n  The Congress will not tolerate this.\\n  Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming \\nevidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false \\ninformation regarding the state of our southern border.\\n  Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.\\n  Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people \\nleaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging \\npopulation and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic \\ndecrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.\\n  Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a \\nslight increase from 2017.\\n  The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs \\nagents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the \\n553,378 apprehensions in 2016.\\n  To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border \\nPatrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in \\n2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.\\n  In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are \\nparents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme \\npoverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\\n  But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border \\nseeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest \\nsince the 1970s.\\n  The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve \\nthe drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts \\nagree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are \\nsmuggled through legal ports of entry.\\n  The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living \\nin border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.\\n  These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas, \\nLas Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.\\n  Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration \\nenforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other \\nenforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US \\nMarshals, and Secret Service.\\n  The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection \\n(CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than \\n59,000 personnel.\\n  CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more \\nthan 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of \\n19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.\\n  Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active-\\nduty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the \\nestimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of \\nNational Guard to the border.\\n  Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress, \\na co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border \\nwall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has \\nappropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.\\n  The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress \\nto help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes \\nHarvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military \\nconstruction.\\n  Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of \\nthese funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly \\nand derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.\\n  In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,'' \\nbut has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national \\nsecurity officials including former secretaries of state, defense \\nsecretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a \\nstatement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the \\nPresident's emergency declaration.\\n  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's \\ndeclaration makes America less safe.\\n  The President is stealing billions from high-priority military \\nconstruction projects that ensure our troops have the essential \\ntraining, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American \\npeople safe, directly undermining America's national security.\\n  The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive \\npower of the purse,\\n\\n\\nand, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, \\nviolating our Founders' vision for America.\\n  Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision \\ntranscends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism, \\nconstitutional fidelity, and putting country first.\\n  That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members \\nof Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46 \\nand uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist \\nefforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching \\npresident.\\n  To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the \\nKing is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold

Mr. Speaker, President Trump's declaration of a national \\nemergency, as an excuse to build a wall that Congress explicitly \\nrejected, is an abuse of his constitutional oath, and cannot be \\ntolerated by a coequal branch of government under the Constitution. We \\nmust reject this unlawful power grab and reassert Congress' authority \\nto exercise the power of the purse.\\n\\n\\n  The Constitution could not be clearer: ``No money shall be drawn from \\nthe Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.'' That \\ncommand reflects a fundamental principle that is older than our \\ndemocracy itself: The chief executive cannot unilaterally spend \\ntaxpayers' money or redirect a budget set by the people's \\nrepresentatives.\\n  Earlier this year, Congress reached a bipartisan compromise to fund \\nthe government, and it was signed by the President. Congress allocated \\nlimited funding for fencing in certain areas, but squarely rejected the \\nPresident's request to build a medieval barrier across the southern \\nborder.\\n  Almost immediately, the President decided to rewrite the budget set \\nby Congress, and he told us exactly why. He was not satisfied with what \\nhe got from the process that the Constitution dictates, so he did an \\nend run and made it an emergency.\\n  He and his aides have barely even tried to pretend that the so-called \\nemergency is a real one. They know that illegal immigration is at \\nhistorically low levels. They know that children and families fleeing \\nviolence are coming here to make lawful asylum claims, not as some kind \\nof invading army.\\n  They know that illegal drugs overwhelmingly get smuggled through \\nports of entry, and that a wall would do nothing to change that. But \\nthey refuse to let the facts and the law stand in the way of their \\npolitical agenda.\\n  Even worse, the emergency law that President Trump invoked allows the \\nmilitary to redirect funds only if an emergency ``requires the use of \\nthe armed forces.'' And those funds can be used only for construction \\nprojects that are ``necessary to support such use of the armed \\nforces.''\\n  But a wall cannot possibly be ``necessary to support'' a military \\noperation on the border because our laws prohibit the military from \\nengaging in law enforcement activities. The military cannot enforce an \\nimmigration law, so the President's actions are doubly unlawful. There \\nis no real emergency; and even if there were, the President could not \\nredirect military funds for a purpose expressly prohibited to the \\nmilitary.\\n  Fortunately, the Constitution does not get suspended based on \\nPresident Trump's preferences about what is convenient or ``faster.'' \\nOur Nation's Founders left it up to all of us, including those of us in \\nCongress, to act as guardians against exactly this type of assault on \\nour constitutional order.\\n  In that spirit, I proudly support this joint resolution, and I call \\nupon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and do the \\nsame.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Homeland Security & Immigration', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

It is just a little bit of a difference in \\nhow we see it.\\n  We are all passionate about this issue, which is evident by the \\nquality of the debate we are having here. But I am going to tell you \\nwhy I came to believe that this was a national emergency.\\n  I was sent down to the border with the National Guard. I went down \\nand did 2 weeks with my unit, which is down there for 2 months.\\n  As part-timers, we go down and we fill in and augment different \\namounts of time. I fly a surveillance aircraft. It is called an RC-26.\\n  We actually work with Border Patrol, and what we would do is, through \\ntechnology, some of the technology that exists, they would get \\nindications of a group coming over the border. We would have a central \\nauthority that would see these groups coming over the border and would \\ntake the limited air assets we had and put them on these groups to \\nsurveil them and then coordinate with Border Patrol, or whatever, to \\ncome in and get them. And what we saw, frankly, was pretty eye-opening \\nfor me.\\n  First off, Arizona has some very rugged territory.\\n  I have worked Texas, by the way, three times doing this exact same \\nmission. I am going to give you an opportunity to guess who the \\nPresident was when I did this mission three other times. It was \\nPresident Obama, because he understood the need for the guard on the \\nborder.\\n  So we would see these groups come over. They would go through this \\nrugged terrain.\\n  By the way, I never worked an area in Arizona where there was a \\nbarrier. We never had to. But there is a lot of area that isn't.\\n  We would then respond, and basically, 9 times out of 10, any time \\nthese groups got any indication that Border Patrol was nearby or there \\nwas an aircraft overhead, they would do what we call a bomb burst. It \\nlooks like that on the infrared we are using. They would run in all \\ndifferent directions, and many people would get separated.\\n  But do you know who the first to bomb blast away from that group was? \\nThe first people, every time, were the coyotes who they paid their life \\nsavings to to bring them over the border--every time.\\n  In fact, one time that exact scenario happened, and a lady was left \\nlost in the desert, hunkered down in a bush. Had Border Patrol not \\nfound her--sure, she will be deported for that because she came in \\nillegally. But if Border Patrol had not found her, I believe that there \\nis a chance that she could have been one of the at least 200 bodies \\nthat they find every year in the desert because they are abandoned by \\ntheir drug traffickers, by their coyotes who are paid for and who pay \\nmoney to the drug cartels.\\n  That is a big part of where these cartels in Mexico get their money, \\nfunneling people over the border, human trafficking. We know the \\nstatistics of the chance of assault during that. We know that kind of \\nstuff.\\n  It wasn't my mission, but my crew was on a mission, the very first \\none, where an illegal was apprehended, and he had 70 pounds of \\nmethamphetamine on him.\\n  Now, I know there is way more than 70 pounds of methamphetamine out \\nthere in the United States, but there are way more people we are not \\nseeing come over that border as well.\\n  People sometimes look at the rugged terrain of Arizona and say, well, \\nwith mountains and hills, that is the natural wall.\\n  By the way, I went hiking on those mountains and hills during my time \\noff, I will say that.\\n  But the other interesting thing is a significant amount of the people \\nwe were following were actually on those mountains and hills. They were \\non the mountains and hills because that rugged terrain is just as \\ndifficult for Border Patrol to navigate as them.\\n  In fact, I watched as a Border Patrol helicopter followed a man \\nprobably 100 feet away. This is on video. Border Patrol can release \\nthis video if they want. The man was running. The Border Patrol cannot \\ninsert Border Patrol agents to capture him. This guy is still gone \\ntoday. He had to have been a coyote or a drug trafficker.\\n  Seeing this repeatedly made me realize this is not a national \\nemergency because of immigration. I actually believe in comprehensive \\nimmigration reform. I want to work with the other side of the aisle to \\nfix all these problems that I think we really actually all agree on. We \\njust can't admit we agree on all this stuff. I look at this and I say \\nthis is an 80 percent solution that we can fix.\\n\\n  But when I came back from the border and I came back from seeing the \\nreal issue that makes this a national emergency--drugs, human \\ntrafficking--that is when I realized something had to be done.\\n  A wall and a barrier is not compassionless. I think border security \\nand compassion actually go hand in hand. Because what we are saying is: \\nCome over to the United States of America, but do it the right and \\nlegal way, because, otherwise, these coyotes in the cartel are going to \\ntake advantage of you, take your life savings, and take you through a \\nvery dangerous route. And when the going gets tough, they are going to \\nleave you to die, because they did that to 200 of them last year in \\nArizona.\\n  It was an eye-opening experience.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion everybody has in this. I \\nrespect everybody's debate in this. This is how I came to the \\nconclusion I did.\\n  Please vote ``no'' on this.\", cat_list={'Technology', 'Homeland Security & Immigration', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \\nyielding.\\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are witnessing is a President who poses a direct \\nthreat to both our military families and America's national security.\\n  First, as we have heard, there is no border emergency. That is a \\nfabrication. The administration's own statistics show that crossings \\nand apprehensions are at a historic low. The vast\\n\\n\\nmajority of illegal drugs come in at our ports of entry. A wall will \\nnot stop that.\\n  Many who cross our borders are women and children. They are not \\nrunning from border agents. They are seeking them out for help and for \\nasylum.\\n  Second, this will make life harder for America's military families, \\nand, thus, hurt our national security. Who would ever intentionally \\nmake life tougher for the brave men and women who serve our country? It \\nis monstrous, really, when you think about the sacrifices that they \\nalready make for this country.\\n  As the chair of the Appropriations Committee Military Construction, \\nVeterans Affairs and Related Agencies Subcommittee, tomorrow I will \\nhold a hearing to ask our service Secretaries exactly which projects \\nthey previously told us they really needed, but now should be \\nsacrificed for a needless wall.\\n  What will these leaders ask their troops to give up just so Trump can \\nhave a useless, wasteful wall? Training or intelligence facilities? \\nHangars for planes that cost billions? Schools for our military \\nfamilies' children? This is a power grab.\\n  After failing to get his way in a funding dispute with Congress, \\nTrump is throwing an unconstitutional temper tantrum. He is using the \\ntools of an authoritarian, jeopardizing our military readiness to steal \\nhimself a wall that he could not get the lawful way. The dangerous \\nprecedent he will set is one that I hope all of my Republican \\ncolleagues will reject.\\n  The President says a wall will keep Americans safe, but stealing \\nfunds from military families makes us all less safe. Bypassing Congress \\nand the Constitution, and starving military families of funding is not \\npatriotism.

Let us do the right thing. \\nVote on this resolution, and do the constitutional point of restoring \\norder to this government.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in \\ndefense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for \\nH.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency \\nissued by the President on February 15, 2019.\\n  The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the \\npetulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the \\nUnited States.\\n  As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the \\nCommittee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on \\nnumerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently \\nthat there is no national emergency or national security crisis that \\njustifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or \\ncompels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I \\nto check and balance the Executive Branch.\\n  The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national \\nemergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely \\ncorrect when she informed him that he did not have the support in \\nCongress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that \\n``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''\\n  In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling \\ndata available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's \\nnational emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.\\n  The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every \\nregion of the country, by every income group and education category.\\n  National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous \\nin their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not \\nconstitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former \\nRepublican senators and Members of Congress.\\n  They understand that after failing to convince the American people or \\nCongress to pay\\n\\n\\nfor his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion dollar concrete \\nwall, the President has now embarked on a course of conduct that is \\ndeeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks and balances \\nwisely established by the Framers and which has served this nation and \\nthe world so well for nearly 250 years.\\n  Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the \\nconstitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate \\n11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency \\ndeclaration that contravenes the will of the American people and \\nnegates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the \\nCongress of the United States.\\n  The Congress will not tolerate this.\\n  Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming \\nevidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false \\ninformation regarding the state of our southern border.\\n  Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.\\n  Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people \\nleaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging \\npopulation and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic \\ndecrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.\\n  Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a \\nslight increase from 2017.\\n  The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs \\nagents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the \\n553,378 apprehensions in 2016.\\n  To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border \\nPatrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in \\n2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.\\n  In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are \\nparents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme \\npoverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\\n  But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border \\nseeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest \\nsince the 1970s.\\n  The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve \\nthe drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts \\nagree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are \\nsmuggled through legal ports of entry.\\n  The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living \\nin border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.\\n  These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas, \\nLas Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.\\n  Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration \\nenforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other \\nenforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US \\nMarshals, and Secret Service.\\n  The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection \\n(CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than \\n59,000 personnel.\\n  CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more \\nthan 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of \\n19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.\\n  Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active-\\nduty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the \\nestimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of \\nNational Guard to the border.\\n  Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress, \\na co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border \\nwall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has \\nappropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.\\n  The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress \\nto help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes \\nHarvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military \\nconstruction.\\n  Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of \\nthese funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly \\nand derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.\\n  In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,'' \\nbut has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national \\nsecurity officials including former secretaries of state, defense \\nsecretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a \\nstatement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the \\nPresident's emergency declaration.\\n  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's \\ndeclaration makes America less safe.\\n  The President is stealing billions from high-priority military \\nconstruction projects that ensure our troops have the essential \\ntraining, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American \\npeople safe, directly undermining America's national security.\\n  The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive \\npower of the purse, and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the \\nbalance of powers, violating our Founders' vision for America.\\n  Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision \\ntranscends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism, \\nconstitutional fidelity, and putting country first.\\n  That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members \\nof Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46 \\nand uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist \\nefforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching \\npresident.\\n  To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the \\nKing is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, I

      "Pandas(Index=301, text=\"  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \\nthank him for the eloquent way that he has presented this legislation \\nto the floor of the House.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to quote from the Constitution of the United \\nStates. It begins with our statement of purpose of the Nation, with the \\npreamble.\\n\\n\\n  ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect \\nUnion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the \\ncommon defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings \\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this \\nConstitution for the United States of America.''\\n\\n\\n  Immediately following that sacred purpose, it says: Article I, the \\nlegislative branch.\\n  Perhaps it is time for our country to have a values-based civics \\nlesson. I applaud our colleague, Congressman Castro, for his leadership \\nin ensuring that this House was ready to reassert our responsibility \\nunder the Constitution and its systems of checks and balance.\\n  In their wisdom, our Founders rejected the idea of a monarch. They \\ndidn't want to live under that. They made that clear. They fought a War \\nof Independence to free themselves from that. Therefore, in their \\nwisdom, they put forth in this Constitution a heart, soul, and core of \\nit: the separation of powers, coequal branches of government to be a \\ncheck and balance on each other.\\n  They saw the wisdom of that and then, of course, added the Bill of \\nRights with further freedoms enumerated. But the core of the \\nConstitution is the separation of power.\\n  Today, we are on this floor of the House, and our colleagues have \\nspoken eloquently about the reality or mythology of the crisis at the \\nborder that the President contends. They have spoken eloquently about \\nthe opportunity cost of the money that the President wants to use for \\nthis ill-conceived wall and what it means to our national security.\\n  But we in this House of Representatives, each one of us, and everyone \\nin public service in our country, takes an oath of office to support \\nand defend the Constitution of the United States. It is our oath. We \\npromise.\\n  That Constitution is about the separation of powers that is being \\nusurped by the executive branch. We in the legislative branch cannot \\nlet that happen.\\n  In fact, I appeal to our Republican colleagues because I do believe \\nand trust that they are people of their word, and if they take an oath \\nto uphold the Constitution, they will honor it with their vote on the \\nfloor today, in keeping, by the way, with, under the previous House \\nSpeaker, our colleagues across the aisle placed a high priority on the \\nseparation of powers and Congress' constitutional prerogatives.\\n  The Republican A Better Way agenda, which they put forth in 2014, \\nread as follows: ``The people granted Congress the power to write laws, \\nraise revenues, and spend and borrow money on behalf of the United \\nStates. There is no power more consequential. . . . Yet for decades, \\nCongress has let this power atrophy, thereby depriving the people of \\ntheir voice.''\\n  Their Better Way goes on to say: ``The Founders insisted on a \\nseparation of powers to protect our constitutional liberties.''\\n  Their proposal goes on to say that James Madison ``warned that the \\nConstitution is a `mere parchment barrier' unless each branch asserted \\nits powers to keep the others in check.''\\n  That is all in the Republican agenda for A Better Way of 2014, so you \\nwould think it would be in keeping with their vote today.\\n  In that spirit, then-Speaker Ryan often lamented that Congress \\n``keeps forfeiting the game, yielding to the executive branch, giving \\nthe President a blank check, not even bothering to read the fine print \\nin some cases.''\\n  We are not going to give any President, Democratic or Republican, a \\nblank check to shred the Constitution of the United States. We would be \\ndelinquent in our duties as Members of Congress if we did not overturn \\nwhat the President is proposing. He is asking each and every one of us \\nto turn our backs on the oath of office that we took to the \\nConstitution of the United States.\\n  I do not believe that the Republicans want to do that. I don't think \\nit is consistent with what they had advocated in the near term and \\nhistorically.\\n  Is your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to \\nthe Constitution of the United States? You cannot let him undermine the \\nstrength of your pledge to protect and defend the Constitution.\\n  Again, our colleagues have talked about the opportunity cost of \\ntaking money from our national security and spending it in this way.\\n  I was at the border this weekend. We all have our stories and the \\nrest, but whatever you think about the wall, let's just put that aside \\nfor the moment. Whatever you think about where you take the money from \\nand where you put it, which is substantial, put that aside for the \\nmoment. The question is: What do you think about yourself, your \\nCongress, your conscience, and your oath of office? I trust that our \\ncolleagues will be consistent in their beliefs and join us in honoring \\nthe oath we all take to support.\\n  The resolution is not about politics. It is not about partisanship. \\nIt is about patriotism. It is about the Constitution of the United \\nStates, which I hold in my hand here. George Washington on the cover of \\nthis says: ``Its only keepers, the people.''\\n  We in the people's House are the keepers of this Constitution. We in \\nthe Congress are the keepers of this Constitution. We in this Congress \\nare in Article I, the Congress of the United States, spelled out very \\nclearly in the Constitution that the powers given to the legislative \\nbranch are the power of the purse, the power to declare war, powers \\nenumerated very carefully by our Founders.\\n  How can you ignore that?

I was \\ndetained due to severe weather and cancelled flights in Oregon.\\n  While there is no doubt that our immigration system is broken, the \\npresident's wall and his proposed funding level is an irresponsible \\nwaste of taxpayer funds for a structure that would be ineffective and \\ndo very little for our national security. The emergency declaration is \\nnothing more than a power grab by the president to fulfill a campaign \\npromise, violating existing law and our constitutional system of \\nseparation of powers.\\n  Congress has already rejected the president's proposed border wall, \\nand alternatively, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, made robust \\ninvestments in our border security. These investments include $1.375 \\nbillion for approximately 55 miles of physical barrier along the \\nsouthern border, $564 million for imaging equipment at our ports of \\nentry, $100 million for new, additional border security technology, \\nserious investments in the Alternative to Detention program to provide \\nrelief to over-crowded detention facilities, and additional funding for \\nattorneys and courtroom expansion to assist with our country's growing \\nimmigration court system backlog.\\n  Despite these important investments, the president has proposed \\ntaking more than $6.7 billion to build his wall, including $3.6 billion \\nfrom the Department of Defense's (DoD) high-priority military \\nconstruction projects. These funds are meant to support much-needed \\nimprovements on military bases around the world, and misallocating \\nthese funds could undermine the training, readiness, and quality of \\nlife for our men and women in the Armed Forces. He has also proposed \\nstripping $2.5 billion from the DoD's drug interdiction program, which \\ncould have serious impacts on our ability to combat the flow of illegal \\nnarcotics.\\n  Furthermore, the Military Construction Codification Act only \\nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to reallocate funds for \\nconstruction projects during a national emergency if the project is \\n``necessary to support'' a ``use of the armed forces.'' Our Armed \\nForces are not responsible for enforcing our immigration laws and using \\nthese funds in this way is in direct violation of existing law.\\n  Of serious additional legal concern is the fact that the \\nadministration would need to seize significant amounts of property not \\nowned by the federal government in order to build a wall. Currently, \\nmore than two thirds of border property is owned by private parties or \\nthe relevant states. In 1952, the Supreme Court held in Youngstown \\nSheet and Tube that President Truman's declaration of national \\nemergency, even in the midst of an international armed conflict, did \\nnot permit him to unilaterally seize private property.\\n  In recent days, more than two dozen former Republican lawmakers and \\nalmost 60 former senior national security officials have come out in \\nopposition to President Trump's national emergency declaration. These \\nindividuals are united behind the idea that allowing the president to \\n``ignore Congress'' will deprive the American people ``of the \\nprotections of true representative government.''\\n  The bottom line is that the president's national emergency \\ndeclaration is an abuse of his constitutional authority and an affront \\nto the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the \\npurse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the president from \\nspending money that has not been appropriated. Congress entrusted the \\npresident with authority to reallocate funds during unforeseen and \\nurgent situations, such as wars and natural disasters. By declaring an \\nemergency when Congress has overwhelmingly rejected his border wall in \\nfavor of compromise legislation, President Trump is creating a \\ndangerous precedent for future political disputes.

      "Pandas(Index=332, text=\"  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, our Nation's continued economic progress \\nand the social mobility of our citizens are contingent on the education \\nand skills of the American workforce and its ability to adjust and \\nfulfill the needs of the 21st century economy. Career and technical \\neducation (CTE) programs are an essential piece of every student's \\neducation, providing them access to the important knowledge, skills, \\nand credentials needed to obtain careers in rapidly growing, high-\\ndemand fields. Today, approximately 12.2 million students across the \\nNation are enrolled in CTE programs offered by thousands of career \\nacademies, comprehensive high schools, CTE high schools, community \\ncolleges, and CTE centers. Through intentionally designed applied \\nlearning, these students gain workplace skills and technical training \\nthat mirror in-demand positions in the workforce.\\n  In the coming decade, a projected 3 million skilled workers will be \\nneeded to fill infrastructure positions in the United States, including \\njobs related to designing, building, and operating transportation, \\nhousing, telecommunication, and utilities facilities. CTE programs \\nintentionally match employability skills with workforce demands, \\nlowering the probability of students dropping out of high school and \\nincreasing their likelihood of graduating on time. These skills-based \\ntraining programs will help fill the estimated 30 million U.S. jobs \\navailable with an average income annual income of $55,000 that do not \\nrequire a bachelor's degree yet necessitate some level of postsecondary \\neducation.\\n  Across Virginia, I hear from manufacturers frustrated by the shortage \\nof qualified skilled production employees--roles that require the \\ntraining and instruction provided in CTE classrooms. It is essential \\nthat we elevate the important role of CTE in the country's ability to \\nmeet the interconnected challenges of economic development, student \\nachievement, and global competitiveness. Last year, Congress affirmed \\nthe importance of CTE by passing the Strengthening Career and Technical \\nEducation for the 21st Century Act which supports CTE programs in \\nsecondary and postsecondary education.\\n  Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus co-chairs Senator Portman, Senator \\nBaldwin, and Senator Young and 47 colleagues in the Senate, I am \\npleased to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate February as \\nCareer and Technical Education (CTE) month. CTE Month encourages \\nstudents, parents, counselors, educators, and school leaders to learn \\nmore about the diverse educational opportunities offered in their \\ncommunities, and recognize the valuable role of CTE in developing a \\nwell-educated and highly skilled workforce in the United States.\\n  By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, it is our \\naim to raise greater awareness of the importance of improving access to \\nhigh-quality CTE for millions of America's students and our nation's \\nongoing economic competitiveness.\\n\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=348, text=\"  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs. I appreciate his help.\\n  I have got a top 10 list here--actually, it has turned into a top 11 \\nlist--of the 10 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1.\\n  Again, I want to remind you that the Democrats took over at the \\nbeginning of the year. We are $22 trillion in debt. And they will say: \\nWell, it is President Trump's fault. Well, we can say: It is President \\nObama's fault. And they will say: Well, it is President Bush's fault. \\nAnd it can go all the way back to George Washington, I expect.\\n  But the fact is it is a bipartisan issue that needs to be dealt with. \\nSo the top 11 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1: It creates, again, a \\n6-1 government match to any small donor contribution of $200 or less in \\na congressional or Presidential campaign, meaning for every $200 the \\ngovernment will match $1,200.\\n  So let's look at the facts. Where does that $1,200 come from? You go \\nto work, you get a paycheck at the end of the week, at the end of the \\nweek you notice that you don't get paid your gross pay, you get paid \\nyour net pay. The rest of the money comes to the government and the \\ngovernment is going to use that money, when we are $22 trillion in \\ndebt, and give out subsidies to support, hopefully, your candidate. \\nThis has never happened before in our government, and we are at $22 \\ntrillion in debt. It does nothing to solve our national debt.\\n\\n\\n  Number two on the list: Creates a new voucher pilot program--a pilot \\nprogram.\\n  And I have to hand it to the Dems. They love programs that give out \\nmoneys and grants, this voucher pilot program that grants eligible \\nvoters a $25 voucher of hard-earned taxpayer dollars to donate to any \\ncampaign of their choosing.\\n  The Federal Government has no need to do this. Again, they are taking \\nmoney from people and using it for that which the government is not \\nmandated by our Constitution to do.\\n  Number three: Authorizes an inappropriate use of Federal workers and \\ntaxpayer dollars by granting Federal employees 6 days of paid vacation \\nto serve as poll watchers.\\n  I would venture that come election day, the largest majority of \\nFederal employees for 6 days will be poll watchers and not running the \\ngovernment. This is just bad policy.\\n  Number four: Weakens the voting system of the American people by \\nincreasing the election system's vulnerability and failing to implement \\nthe necessary checks and balances regarding who is registering to vote. \\nH.R. 1 will force States to allow online voter registration, automatic \\nvoter registration, and, I think the most dangerous and egregious, \\nsame-day voter registration.\\n  So that means I can show up in Florida, my home State, and I can \\nregister to vote that day. I can drive to Georgia\\n\\n\\nand register to vote that day. I can go to Alabama, Louisiana, North \\nCarolina, South Carolina, and I can possibly vote in every one of those \\nStates, because the driving distance, I could make that.\\n  So I could vote in possibly seven or eight States as a single person \\non the day of voting. Nobody could validate that. Yet the election gets \\ncalculated and determined on those kinds of voting, and I don't think \\nthat is what anybody wants.\\n  I would hope, regardless of your political affiliation, you would \\nstand up to say this is wrong. We need to make sure these safeguards \\nare in place to protect that one very, I think, sacred, precious right \\nof all voters, of all American citizens, the right to vote.\\n  Number five: Diminishes the process of election day voting by \\nexpanding ``no excuse'' absentee voting and allowing for eligible \\nvoters to be able to cast their ballot by mail with no additional \\nsafeguards to this process.\\n  That means provisional ballots that get sent in, their signature \\ncan't be questioned. It doesn't need to be questioned. It doesn't have \\nto be the correct signature, but it will be counted as a vote.\\n  I would think a party that put that in place would be afraid of that, \\nbecause it really weakens the democratic process we go through as a \\nconstitutional republic.\\n  Number six: Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing \\nsworn statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for \\nsignature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the \\nvoter registers online.\\n  Let me read that again.\\n  Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing sworn \\nstatements to be used in place of identification and allowing for \\nsignature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the \\nvoter registers online.\\n  Now, think about that. I can't get on an airplane without a picture \\nID. I can't purchase medication, over-the-counter cold medication with \\nphenylephrine in it, without a picture ID, but we are going to allow \\npeople to vote without a picture ID just by signing an affidavit saying \\nI am who I say I am. And, again, that won't be verified until after the \\nelection.\\n  It has fraud written all over it, and I think it is unconscionable \\nthat the Democrats would even consider such a thing on something that \\nwe hold so sacred in this Nation, that we brag about and we boast about \\nin the world as being the longest serving democracy in the world using \\na democratic process in a constitutional republic, that we are going to \\nallow such shoddy type of verification.\\n  Again, it is unconscionable that they would even consider bringing \\nthis up.\\n  Number seven: Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations.\\n  Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations. We have people going \\nto jail because they have lied to the FBI. We have George Papadopoulos \\nwho lied to the FBI, and he went to prison for 14 days. But I can lie \\nand not be who I say I am, and I can vote on this Democratic bill, H.R. \\n1, and I have no recourse against me. There is no consequence for me \\nbeing a liar.\\n  And I just think a party that wants to have those kinds of policies \\nin place as a whole needs to look in the mirror and say: What are we \\ntrying to do?\\n  Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration \\nand voting practices as protected under Article I, Section 4 of the \\nConstitution and violates separation of powers by Congress mandating \\nethics standards for the Supreme Court. H.R. 1 is a constitutional \\noverreach.\\n  Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration \\nvoting practices as protected, as I said, under Article I, Section 4.\\n  Number nine: Violates constitutional rights under the First Amendment \\nby prohibiting any false statements relating to Federal elections, \\nincluding time, manner, place, qualifications of candidates, or \\nendorsements of candidates enforced by a partisan FEC, which is the \\nFederal Elections Committee.\\n  Number 10: Empowers trial attorneys by establishing private rights of \\naction by allowing candidates to litigate their way to victory.\\n  We saw this in the last Presidential election. We saw this in the \\nlast gubernatorial election in my State of Florida. We saw this in the \\nsenatorial race in Florida, where people were going to sue, and they \\ndidn't have the legality of doing that, but this bill would allow that.\\n\\n  And I think one of the largest grievances for H.R. 1 that all people \\nought to be upset with is that it mandates voter registration--mandates \\nvoter registration. What that means is the Federal Government says you \\nmust register to vote.\\n  I agree, we should all register to vote, but can the government \\nmandate you?\\n  We tried this with the Affordable Care Act that the Democrats ran \\nthrough in a partisan manner in this Chamber, no Republican support, \\nmandated that people had to buy a product even if they didn't want \\nthat.\\n  Madam Speaker, that is wrong, and that is why that part got struck \\ndown, the individual mandate got struck down, as it should have, \\nbecause the Federal Government was saying: If you don't do what we say, \\nwe are going to fine you.\\n  You know, that sounds like China. China does that. They have their \\ngood citizen score, the Orwellian good citizen score that they monitor \\nwhat you do, and if you don't do it, you don't get the prizes of the \\nChinese Government. Are we turning into that, mandating voters to \\nregister?\\n  Last Congress, I chaired the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation \\nSubcommittee on Foreign Affairs. And it was amazing because I got to \\ntravel to countries around the world that have just started free and \\nopen elections in a Western, democratic style. It pains me to see these \\ncountries with a new democracy where 95 percent to 98 percent of the \\npeople show up.\\n  If you look at Iraq or Afghanistan, they are walking around with the \\npurple finger at risk of their lives, because for once in their life \\nthey had an opportunity to vote, to vote for somebody that they wanted \\nin power--a foreign concept to them. Yet in this country, we want to \\ntake that away from people.\\n  As we continue on, there are some myths on H.R. 1.\\n  It has been designed to fund, elect, and maintain Democratic \\nmajority, and I want the American people to know that. The Democrats \\nintroduced this 571-page package of Democratic priorities without \\nallowing for input from Republican Members or going through the \\nstandard House Committee.\\n  This is something that they railed against us. All the 6 years I have \\nbeen in Congress, they have railed against us about no open process, \\nyet they come out with a 571-page package of Democratic priorities \\nwithout allowing for input from one Republican Member.\\n  H.R. 1 will waste taxpayers' money, federalize the election system, \\nweaken safeguards surrounding voter registration, and violate \\nAmericans' constitutional right to free speech under the First \\nAmendment.\\n  The estimated cost of this that we got for H.R. 1, because of all the \\nsubsidies and the other garbage that is in this, is over $10 billion to \\nthe American taxpayers--$10 billion--when we are already at $22 \\ntrillion in debt.\\n  I would like to go through a few myths.\\n  Democrats are empowering citizens. That is the myth. The facts are \\nDemocrats are using citizens' hard-earned taxpayer dollars to fund \\ntheir candidates:\\n  Voucher from the government to the campaign: Through this bill, \\neligible voters would receive a $25 voucher from the Federal Government \\nthat they can use to donate to the campaign of their choice, meaning \\nhard-earned taxpayer dollars are going to be going to the government, \\nto their campaign of choice;\\n  Government matching campaign donations in congressional races: Under \\nH.R. 1, the Federal Government will be required to match small \\ncontributions under $200 at 6 to 1. Taxpayer dollars will be going to \\nthe government to fund candidates;\\n  Government matching campaign donations in Presidential races: Also, \\nunder H.R. 1, there is a 6-to-1 government match of small contributions \\nin a Presidential campaign, up to $250 million. A quarter of $1 billion \\nwould be going towards the Presidential campaign, and there is no limit \\nto contributions.\\n\\n\\n  Another Democrat myth: Democrats are promoting integrity. The facts \\nare Democrats are promoting the interests of Washington, D.C., swamp, \\nnot yours:\\n  Federal paid vacations: Federal workers would get a 6-day paid \\nvacation to serve as poll watchers;\\n  16-year-old voters: H.R. 1 will open the door to 16-year-old voters \\nby requiring States to allow them to register and vote;\\n  Free speech violation: Prohibits any false statements related to \\nFederal elections, including time, manner, place, qualifications, \\ncandidates, or endorsement.\\n  And I want to go back over this one other myth. Democrats are \\ncreating vulnerabilities in the voting system:\\n  Automatic voter registration--automatic voter registration, mandates \\nfrom the Federal Government, boy, how the Dems like that--requires all \\nStates to adopt an automatic voter registration system that would be \\nrelying on the Federal Government for records. There would be no \\ncriminal punishment for an ineligible voter who is registered in error.\\n\\n  Madam Speaker, as you have heard, my colleagues and I have severe \\nconcerns about H.R. 1. While my colleagues on the other side of the \\naisle are marketing it as a fix to the American voting system, what it \\nreally does is degrade the standards we have had in place for over 200 \\nyears to protect American voters and the voting process.\\n  As Members in Congress, we have the responsibility to ensure that \\nevery American has the right to vote and the access to vote and that \\nthat vote is guaranteed and protected. H.R. 1 does not do this, and I \\nencourage my colleagues to consider this implication and not support \\nthis bill.\\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=352, text=\"  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise this evening to speak on a \\nsubject that, with the groundswell of activism, has once again captured \\nnational attention--and rightfully so.\\n  Many years ago, I was a young naval flight officer stationed at a \\nmock field naval air station in the Bay area out in California, \\npreparing for the first of what would be three tours of duty in \\nSoutheast Asia during the Vietnam war. I joined there with tens of \\nthousands of people one day to celebrate our country's first-ever Earth \\nDay. I will never forget it.\\n  This was back when polluters dumped waste into our waterways with \\nimpunity. Garbage littered our shores, and too many rivers oozed \\ninstead of flowed. One of them was in Cleveland, OH. The Cuyahoga \\nRiver, north of where I went to school at Ohio State, actually caught \\non fire. Factories spewed toxic fumes, and acid rain fell from the sky. \\nThe urgency was clear then, and it is even clearer today.\\n  That very first Earth Day was a transformative experience for me, and \\nit will serve as an inspiration for me for the rest of my life.\\n  As I look at what is happening across our country today, I see the \\nmovement for bold and transformative action to save our planet. I see \\nthe faces of those who were there with me that day in Golden Gate State \\nPark.\\n  I have had a lot of different jobs since then, but it is not lost on \\nme that I stand here today on the brink of yet another watershed moment \\nas the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \\nWorks--the committee that oversees our Nation's environmental laws--to \\ntalk about climate change.\\n  In the days and weeks ahead, Senator McConnell intends to engage in a \\nploy to try and undermine the Green New Deal by calling a vote for a \\nresolution he does not even support. I believe he hopes that, in turn, \\nthere may be some disruption and damage inflicted on the Democratic \\nParty and the climate change movement.\\n  To the American people, hear this; it is a simple message: We \\ncannot--we will not--allow cynicism to win, not now and not with so \\nmuch at stake.\\n  When it comes to climate action, there could not be a starker \\ndifference in this Chamber between the Democratic Party and the \\nRepublican Party in this debate.\\n  We, as Democrats, may not agree on exactly how we should address \\nclimate change, but we all agree it is happening. We agree that human \\nactivity is the main cause, and we agree that we must act now.\\n  Democrats know that climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. It \\nis not an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning \\norganization. It doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from \\nour Nation's leading scientists and leading scientists from all around \\nthe world.\\n  Just 3 months ago, 13 Federal Agencies released a comprehensive \\nclimate report that described the dire economic and health consequences \\nwe face if we fail to take meaningful action to address climate change \\nnow. I may be mistaken, but I believe those 13 Federal Agencies were \\nacting under law signed by a Republican President. I believe it was \\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush.\\n  This report is the Fourth National Climate Assessment. It was \\ndeveloped over a 3-year period by more than 300 Federal experts and \\nnon-Federal experts who volunteered their time--who volunteered their \\ntime.\\n  Here is a brief summary of their report: The science behind climate \\nchange is settled. Let me say that again. The science behind climate \\nchange is settled.\\n  From our warming oceans to our atmosphere, climate change is \\nhappening, and human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, is greatly \\ncontributing to this crisis.\\n  Our Nation's scientists have found a direct link between climate \\nchange and the extreme weather we experienced in 2017, which altogether \\ncost the American economy more than $300 billion--that is $300 billion \\nin economic damages, more than any year before.\\n  Scientists are no longer asking if climate change is happening but \\nrather how bad is it going to be. How bad is it going to be? Numbers \\nand the facts don't lie. It will only get worse if we do nothing.\\n  If we don't act on climate change by 2050, wildfire seasons could \\nburn up to six times--six times--more forest area every year. If we \\ndon't act on climate change, we will see more extreme flooding that \\ndevastates small communities like Ellicott City, MD, not far from here, \\nwhich has been hit by not one 1,000-year flood in the past year but \\ntwo. These are floods that are supposed to occur maybe once every 1,000 \\nyears. They had two of them in the last 2 years.\\n  If we don't act on climate change, rising temperatures, combined with \\nincreasingly frequent and severe rain, mean farmers are likely to \\nexperience a reduction in corn and soybean yields by up to 25 percent. \\nIf we don't act on climate change, we will see more deadly category 5 \\nhurricanes and storm surges like the ones we saw with Hurricanes Irma \\nand Maria just 2 years ago.\\n  If we do not act on climate change, we will see economic pain across \\nevery major sector of our economy in this country. The 2018 National \\nClimate Assessment concludes that at the end of this century, climate \\nchange could slash our gross domestic product by 10 percent.\\n  How much is that compared to what? Well, compared to the losses we \\nsustained in the great recession just a decade ago, 10 percent is more \\nthan double those losses--more than double.\\n  It doesn't matter if you are from a coastal State or from a \\nlandlocked State. I have lived in both. It doesn't matter if you care \\nabout public health or the environment or if you care about our economy \\nor national security. The fact is, every person living in\\n\\n\\nthis country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate \\nchange if they haven't already done so today.\\n  We have two options. We confront this challenge head on--reduce \\ncarbon emissions, enhance resiliency, and support millions of new clean \\nenergy jobs--or we could choose to ignore the problem and pass the \\nbuck. To whom? To our children, to their children, and to their \\nchildren.\\n  Senator McConnell, President Trump, and Andrew Wheeler at EPA want to \\npass the buck. They prefer to walk away from the growing threat we \\nface. Instead of pursuing any ideas to address climate change and \\nprotect Americans from its effect, sadly, the Trump administration has \\npromoted policies that increase our dependency on dirty energy.\\n  President Trump has even said he doesn't believe in climate change. \\nHe doubts the credibility of his own scientists at NASA and at NOAA, as \\nwell as 97 percent of the global scientific community. Continuing to \\nmisinform the American people and delay real climate action puts \\nAmerican lives and our economy at risk.\\n  It doesn't have to be this way. As Democrats, we choose to confront \\nclimate change. We choose to do so now. We know our communities are \\nfeeling the pain now from the climate crisis because we see the effects \\nof climate change every day across this country.\\n  We may not yet agree on exactly how we must address climate change, \\nbut we all agree on three things. Here they are. One, we agree climate \\nchange is real; two, human activity during the last 100 years is a \\ndominant cause of the climate crisis we face today; and three, the \\nUnited States, and especially the Congress, that is us, the House and \\nthe Senate, and the administration should take immediate action to \\naddress the challenge of climate change.\\n  That is why I will be introducing a resolution that says just that. \\nDemocrats know we can have a healthy climate and a strong economy. They \\nare not mutually exclusive. Anyone who says otherwise is preaching a \\nfalse choice.\\n  Democrats know this because of the work we started with President \\nObama in the White House, where we accomplished real actions to put \\nthis Nation on a path of net zero emissions. Our Republicans friends \\nacross the aisle should know this because of the work done by the \\nformer President, the late George Herbert Walker Bush, years earlier \\nthat I just alluded to a minute ago.\\n  During the Obama administration, starting with the Recovery Act, the \\nFederal Government provided economic incentives, environmental targets, \\nand supported market developments to encourage investments in the clean \\nenergy of the future.\\n  Thanks to the investments during the previous administration, \\nconsumers are paying less for energy, and more than 3 million people in \\nthis country went to work today in the clean energy sector--3 million \\nand growing.\\n  Democrats know we must build on this progress, and that is why we \\ncontinue to support policies that reduce our Nation's carbon footprint, \\nhelp create a fair economy, and support those most vulnerable to \\nclimate effects, but in the U.S. Senate, as in most places, it takes \\ntwo to tango, and for over two decades Democrats have put forth \\ndifferent policies that use market forces, make big investments in \\ntechnology, or set strict standards. We have done them all, and we \\ndon't seem to get very far with our friends on the other side of this \\naisle. I know because I have cosponsored many of these efforts.\\n  Let me just say this. We are not going to give up. We are going to \\nkeep on trying. We will not back down. We are going to stand our \\nground.\\n  Let me leave our colleagues with this message today. This should not \\nbe an issue. Climate action should not be an issue that divides us as a \\nbody. It shouldn't divide us as a country or as a world. It should \\nunify us.\\n  I thank Senator McConnell in advance for allowing the Senate to \\ndevote a fulsome period of time to this important discussion. How we \\nchoose to act today will not decide our fates. How we choose to act \\ntoday will decide the fates of generations of Americans--not just our \\nfates but generations of Americans that will be on this Earth long \\nafter the rest of us are gone. So let's get to work. Time is wasting. \\nLet's get to work.\\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Massachusetts, who has done \\ngreat work on this for as long as I have been alive--almost as long as \\nI have been alive, my friend and my colleague who has been a giant on \\nthese issues for a long time and continues to be.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=353, text=\"  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I thank our great leader on the \\nEnvironment Committee for his visionary work on this issue. I am here \\nfor the same purpose today. I am here to talk about climate change, \\nabout our climate crisis, and about the mistake it would be to put \\nAndrew Wheeler in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  Climate change is an existential threat to our country and to the \\nplanet. We know this because the world's leading scientists, the United \\nNation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, just made that \\nwarning late last year. It is an existential threat to the planet.\\n  The U.N. report told us we have very limited time until we are past \\nthe point of no return, and the most catastrophic impacts of climate \\nchange are irreversible.\\n  Our own Federal scientists across 13 Agencies also just warned in the \\nNational Climate Assessment that the impacts of climate change are not \\nin the future, but they are happening in our communities right now.\\n  Here is what all 13 U.S. Federal Agencies said. They said our efforts \\ndo not yet approach the scale necessary to avoid substantial damages to \\nthe economy, environment, and human health. These are Earth-shattering \\nreports about the state of our Earth. These are the doomsday reports \\nabout what happens if we do not take bold action.\\n  The dire consequences of climate change, in fact, are arriving. A \\ntenfold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic, 99 percent loss of \\ncoral reefs, and a doubling of species lost around the world. In the \\nNortheast, in worst-case scenarios, by the end of the century, both the \\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and Logan Airport will be under \\nwater, and over 20 percent of Boston's population will face flood risk.\\n  The climate emissions are not slowing down. In 2018, emissions \\nincreased 2.8 percent. We have the ``Denier in Chief'' in the White \\nHouse, and this week Republicans in the Senate are poised to confirm a \\ncoal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  During his confirmation hearing, when I asked whether he agreed with \\nthe conclusions of the National Climate Assessment report, Mr. Wheeler \\nsaid he still needed additional briefings before he could make a public \\ncomment on it. Let me repeat that. The nominee of Donald Trump to run \\nthe Agency charged with protecting the planet from climate change had \\nnot even sufficiently reviewed the climate report from our own Federal \\nAgencies before his confirmation hearing. He also said he considered \\nthe report to be a representation of the worst-case scenario and that \\nwhat we face is ``a climate issue.''\\n  Well, the worst-case scenario is one in which the Republican Senate \\nwill confirm a former coal lobbyist to head the Environmental \\nProtection Agency. The worst-case scenario is the Trump \\nadministration's plans to roll back the Clean Power Plan and the fuel \\neconomy emission standards, the single largest steps we have ever taken \\nto address climate change. We are in a worst-case scenario, and we need \\nto dramatically change course.\\n  That should start by not confirming Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, \\nto run the Agency charged with protecting our planet. Andrew Wheeler's \\nanswers on the climate crisis should be disqualifying. His record as a \\ncoal lobbyist should be disqualifying. We should come together and \\nreject Andrew Wheeler as the head of the EPA.\\n  The impact of climate change on ordinary families on their health, on \\nour Nation, on our security, and on our future is too urgent. We must \\nbe bold. We must be ambitious.\\n  That is why I have introduced the Green New Deal resolution. It lays \\nout a serious, bold, aspirational set of goals\\n\\n\\nthat meet the scale of the threat we are facing. It is a set of \\nprinciples, not prescriptions. The Green New Deal will allow us to \\nengage in massive job creation to save all of creation. It calls for a \\nmassive 10-year mobilization to transform our climate, our economy, our \\ndemocracy. It is about jobs and justice.\\n  An overwhelming number of Americans support climate action, and a \\nmajority of Americans support a Green New Deal. Never in our history \\nhave the interests of all Americans been so united in a single issue: \\nclimate change.\\n  From the air we breathe to the jobs that employ us, to the \\nneighborhoods we live in, to the economy we operate within, climate \\nchange defines our existence. This is the time for serious solutions. \\nGlobal temperatures are the highest in recorded history. Wealth \\ninequality is at its highest point since the era of the Great \\nDepression. The erosion of our coastlines, the erosion of earning power \\nof workers, the pollution of our planet, the pollution of our democracy \\nby Big Oil and Koch brothers financing, the relationship between these \\nills and injustices is undeniable, but the challenge is not \\ninsurmountable.\\n  It will only be through a historic intergenerational commitment to \\nend climate change that we create the kind of democracy that works for \\nall Americans. This Green New Deal mobilization will make the United \\nStates the global leader on clean energy and climate action.\\n  This mobilization will be the greatest blue-collar jobs program in a \\ngeneration. This mobilization will be an opportunity to repair the \\nhistoric oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities that have \\nborne the worst burdens of pollution from our fossil fuel economy--\\nthese communities that also will be the most affected and the least \\nable to respond to the impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal \\nrepresents an opportunity to lift up all workers and all communities.\\n  President Roosevelt was right when he said about the New Deal that \\n``statesmanship and vision, my friends, require relief to all at the \\nsame time.''\\n  We are talking about a historic, 10-year mobilization that will \\nmitigate climate emissions and build climate resiliency. We have acted \\non this scale before, and we must do it again.\\n  We have already laid the foundation for our climate future. In 2008, \\nwe had only 1,200 megawatts of total solar capacity in the United \\nStates. Today, we have 65,000 megawatts. In 2008, we had only 25,000 \\nmegawatts of total wind capacity. Today, we have 98,000 megawatts of \\nwind capacity. In 2008, there were only 2,500 all-electric vehicles in \\nour country. Today, we have 1 million, with 500,000 new all-electric \\nvehicles to be sold this year. Most of all, what we have seen over the \\npast 10 years is a growing movement for climate action. In wind and \\nsolar, we now have 350,000 people who are employed. That didn't happen \\n10 years ago; it is happening today.\\n  The Green New Deal is not just a resolution; it is a revolution. \\nRepublicans and climate deniers are taking mathematical liberties to \\nsay it would cost too much to act, but the cost of inaction on climate \\nwill be far higher. Over just the past 2 years, the cost of storms and \\nthe cost of fires in our country created over $400 billion in damages. \\nBy the end of this century, it will be tens of trillions of dollars \\nthat we will lose. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If \\nwe start today, we can avoid the worst, most catastrophic consequences. \\nFor those who say we can't afford to act to address this crisis, I say \\nwe can't afford not to.\\n  The question is, Will any Republican stand up to fight for these \\ngoals? The Republican Party is about to confirm a coal lobbyist to run \\nthe Environmental Protection Agency. That is where we are in 2019, with \\nthe worst scientific reports coming from the U.N. and our own \\nscientists--a threat of an existential risk for the planet--and we are \\nabout to confirm a coal lobbyist.\\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be bold the way President Kennedy \\nwas in 1962 when he called for a mission to the Moon to be accomplished \\nwithin 10 years. He said it would not be easy. He said we would have to \\ninvent metal that did not exist and propulsion systems that did not \\nexist. He said we would have to bring that mission back safely through \\nheat half the intensity of the Sun, and we would have to do so safely \\nwithin 10 years so that we could control outer space. We did that, \\nladies and gentlemen, and we can do it again.\\n  We have to accept this challenge. We can do it. We can unleash an \\ninnovation revolution in our country, and again we will do it to save \\nall creation by engaging in massive job creation, a blue-collar \\nrevolution hiring millions of workers to do this job.\\n  I thank you, Madam President. This is a very important week before \\nus.\\n  I yield back to my colleague.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Technology', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=359, text=\"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It goes the other way.\\n  Sometimes it seems that our friends on the other side of the aisle \\nthink that the only people who are watching this conversation are \\nfossil fuel industry lobbyists and CEOs and electioneers.\\n  So we are going through, shortly, a truly preposterous exercise on \\nthe floor of the Senate, which is that a party that has brought up no \\nsignificant legislation in the time that Leader McConnell has had the \\nfloor is now going to bring its first measure related to climate for a \\nfloor vote, and it is something they intend to vote against. It is \\nsomething they intend to vote against. When you bring a measure to the \\nfloor that it is your intention to vote against, that is not \\nlegislating. Something else is going on.\\n  Now I think this was a very clever stunt. We don't know quite where \\nit was cooked up, but we have observed that the Wall Street Journal \\neditorial page is a relentless mouthpiece for the fossil fuel industry, \\nhaving published climate denial articles literally within the last \\nyear. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called for this stunt \\nvote, and it was less than 24 hours before the Republicans in the \\nSenate jumped up, scampered out, and did exactly what they were told to \\ndo by the fossil fuel industry's mouthpiece, the Wall Street Journal \\neditorial page.\\n  I am sure there were champagne corks banging into the ceilings of the \\nboardrooms for ExxonMobil, Americans for Prosperity, and the Koch \\nIndustries as all of these fossil fuel executives and lobbyists cheered \\nthis stunt. But in the Senate, we actually have a larger audience than \\njust fossil fuel donors; the country is watching and the world is \\nwatching, and what they are seeing right now is, frankly, an \\nembarrassment.\\n  It is not just this stunt that reflects a broken Senate; it is a much \\nlarger problem of a Senate that cannot deal with the climate change \\nissue in a bipartisan fashion.\\n  I would state that when I got here in 2007, the Senate could deal \\nwith climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2008, the Senate could \\ndeal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2009, the Senate \\ncould deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. The reason I \\nknow that is because I was here then, and I saw as many as five \\nbipartisan efforts to deal with climate change during that period, with \\ndifferent Republican and Democratic Senators. Then along came the \\nCitizens United decision in January 2010, and from that moment after, \\nit was like watching a patient drop dead in the emergency room. The \\nheartbeat of activity on climate change just flatlined on the \\nRepublican side of this Chamber.\\n  I think the fossil fuel industry--I know the fossil fuel industry \\nasked for that decision from the Supreme Court and the five Republican \\nJustices. I think they anticipated what the decision was going to be, \\nand they immediately went to work to squelch and crush any dissent from \\ntheir orthodoxy\\n\\n\\non that side of the aisle. The result has been that there has been no \\nsignificant piece of climate legislation to reduce carbon dioxide \\nemissions and to deal with this problem since Citizens United that any \\nof our colleagues now will cosponsor or support. It has just been \\nsilent, and it is a dramatic failure in this greatest deliberative \\nbody.\\n  I will state, as others have stated, as Ranking Member Carper and \\nSenator Markey have said, that the science on this is now beyond \\ndispute. The science on this is irrefutable. If we fail to deal with \\nthis problem, the consequences will be catastrophic and irreversible.\\n  ``Irrefutable science.'' ``Catastrophic and irreversible \\nconsequences.'' I am actually quoting somebody when I say that. Do you \\nknow whom I am quoting? I am quoting from 2009 Donald Trump--Donald \\nTrump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and the Trump \\nOrganization signed this full-page advertisement in the New York Times \\nin 2009. ``If we fail to act now,'' they said, ``it is scientifically \\nirrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible \\nconsequences for humanity and our planet.'' So as much as the fossil \\nfuel-funded mockery in which the Republican Party has engaged, \\nchallenges these facts, even the Trumps knew this a decade ago.\\n  In trying to describe the Green New Deal, one might describe it as \\nsomething that, if you invested in it, would ``drive state-of-the-art \\ntechnologies that will spur economic growth, create new energy jobs, \\nand increase our energy security all while reducing the harmful \\nemissions that are putting our planet at risk.'' That is a pretty good \\ncapsule of the Green New Deal.\\n  Guess what Donald Trump and his family said in the same \\nadvertisement.\\n\\n       Investing in a Clean Energy Economy will drive state-of-\\n     the-art technologies that will spur economic growth, create \\n     new energy jobs, and increase our energy security all while \\n     reducing the harmful emissions that are putting our planet at \\n     risk.\\n\\n  All you have to do is listen to the 2009 Donald Trump to understand \\nthat the science of climate change was then irrefutable and it is even \\nstronger now and that the consequences of our failure to act and our \\nobedience, our adherence to fossil fuel-funded propaganda and orthodoxy \\nwill lead to consequences that are catastrophic and irreversible--said \\na decade ago. We have had 10 more years of unrestricted emissions since \\nthen.\\n  Just the basic tenets of the Green New Deal are ``a clean energy \\neconomy [that] will drive state-of-the-art technologies that will spur \\neconomic growth, create new energy jobs, and increase our energy \\nsecurity.''\\n  With the words of Donald Trump, I rest my case and yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

This administration has done \\nnothing to address this issue, and President Trump selects a fossil \\nfuel lobbyist to be head of the EPA.

We have proved that is simply not true. We have \\nproved it in my State, where we have lots of wind turbines, made \\nusually with American-made steel. We have proved it in Toledo, where we \\nhave one of the biggest solar energy manufacturers in the country. We \\nproved it in the auto industry, where the auto industry has generally \\nhad a pretty good decade making more fuel-efficient cars. We put \\nAmericans to work, and we can change course on climate change before it \\nis too late.\\n  Mitch McConnell and President Trump seem to think climate change--\\nthat is notwithstanding what Senator Whitehouse said--is a joke. I have \\nnews for them. Climate change is not something to play political games \\nwith; it is a crisis we need to confront and set an example around the \\nworld. It is a crisis we need to confront and to set an example for our \\npartners around the world.\\n\\n  It would be shameful enough to have no ideas and no plan to confront \\nour biggest threats. But not only do President Trump and Leader \\nMcConnell have no plan, not only are they denying the problem, and not \\nonly are they standing in the way of solutions, but they are actually \\nworking to make climate change worse. It is just despicable.\\n  They are spreading lies and stacking the administration with shills \\nfor the fossil fuel industry. They stacked the administration with Wall \\nStreet cronies to do bank regulation. They stacked the administration \\nwith fossil fuel cronies and shills to do energy and climate and \\nenvironmental regulation.\\n  We got news this week that the White House is going to use your \\ntaxpayer dollars to set up a panel to promote junk science and spread \\nthe debunked conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.\\n  This week we will vote on the President's nominee to head the EPA, a \\nlobbyist who would be overseeing the same special interests who have \\npaid his salary. Andrew Wheeler is just the latest in a long line of \\ncronies from the fossil fuel industry who President Trump has put in \\ncharge at the EPA and the Department of the Interior.\\n  Climate change is not a future problem. It does damage to this \\ncountry right now. It is threatening thousands of Ohio workers who rely \\non Lake Erie for their livelihood, whether it is tourism or other \\nindustries that rely on clean water.\\n  Climate change makes algal blooms worse. Off the shores of Toledo, it \\ncontaminates our lake, threatens our drinking water, and hurts small \\nbusiness. Nobody on that side of the aisle seems to give a darn.\\n  I have talked to farmers who have been farming in the Western Lake \\nErie Basin for decades. They tell me they are experiencing heavier rain \\nevents more often and with greater intensity compared to even 15 years \\nago.

It is time to create new \\njobs in clean energy and energy-efficient manufacturing. It is time for \\nthe United States to be the leader the world looks to.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, \\nHouse Resolution 145, providing for consideration of H.R. 8, the \\nBipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced \\nBackground Checks Act of 2019.\\n  The rule provides for consideration of each bill under a structured \\nrule. The rule also provides 1 hour of general debate on each bill \\nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \\nof the Committee on the Judiciary.\\n  The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 and the Enhanced \\nBackground Checks Act of 2019 arrived at a time of emergency for \\nAmerica--a real emergency. Every year 120,000 Americans are shot in our \\ncountry, and 35,000 of them are shot dead. Seventeen thousand of the \\npeople wounded or killed each year are children or teenagers, their \\nfamilies devastated, their lives forever changed.\\n  In 2017, gun deaths in America hit the highest level in 40 years, \\nwith 40,000 Americans killed.\\n  We have lost more Americans to gun violence in our own communities \\nthan to the Vietnam war, the Revolutionary\\n\\n\\nWar, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean war, the Iraq \\nwar, and the Afghan war, combined. This war at home never stops. Each \\nday--yesterday, today, and tomorrow--another 100 people in America are \\nshot and killed by gun violence.\\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not a global problem; it is an American problem. \\nWhile 35,000 Americans are killed by gunfire here each year, it is 146 \\npeople in the United Kingdom, 142 in Portugal, and 30 in Japan.\\n  We lose more people to gun violence in a single weekend than England \\nloses all year. We lost more people in the Las Vegas massacre alone, in \\none bloody night, than the nation of Japan lost to gun violence in 8 \\nyears.\\n  No other developed, high-income country's lethal gun violence even \\ncomes close to the American carnage allowed by our loophole-ridden gun \\nlaws. The gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times \\nhigher than the average of other high-income countries and hundreds of \\ntimes higher than some of them.\\n  Now, the good news is that we know what to do to begin to end this \\ncrisis. We must close the loopholes.\\n  In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act went into effect \\nand required licensed firearm dealers to contact the FBI to run a \\nbackground check through NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background \\nCheck System.\\n  The Brady Act made it illegal to sell a firearm to felons, to \\nfugitives, to people who had been committed to mental institutions, to \\ndrug addicts, to domestic abusers, to undocumented immigrants, and to \\nother disqualified categories.\\n  The Brady Act worked as far as it went. It stopped more than 3 \\nmillion illegal purchases of firearms by convicted felons, violently \\nabusive partners, fugitives, the mentally ill, and so on. But there are \\ngaping loopholes in the law because unlicensed gun sellers, the people \\nwho sell guns online today or at gun shows or in other private \\ntransactions, can sell firearms without having to run any background \\ncheck whatsoever.\\n  More than one-fifth of U.S. gun owners acquired their most recent \\nfirearm without any background check at all, which means that millions \\nof people obtained millions of firearms without going through the Brady \\nsystem, and people who commit gun crimes overwhelmingly obtain their \\nfirearms from the unlicensed sources. A 2013 study found that 80 \\npercent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes were obtained \\nfrom sources that were not required to go through the background check.\\n  The criminals are not stupid. They follow the loopholes. They go to \\nthe internet. They go to the gun shows. They go to the convenience \\nstore parking lots to get their weapons of mass destruction without any \\nbackground check at all.\\n  Our legislation will close these dangerous loopholes by guaranteeing \\nthat there is a thorough NICS background check on every gun sale or \\ntransfer, with only a few carefully defined exceptions for intrafamily \\ngifts and a few other cases.\\n  Mr. Speaker, there are three primary things you need to know about \\nthis legislation:\\n  First, it is backed by more than 90 percent of the American people--\\nfully, 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun owners, 97 \\npercent of Republicans, and 99 percent of Democrats. It is the very \\nessence of common sense, the sense we all have in common, to make the \\nbackground check system comprehensive and universal, leakproof, \\nfoolproof, and not ridden by the loopholes.\\n  A background check doesn't work if criminals know that there are \\nmassive and lawful ways to cheat and get around it. So America, today, \\nstands up to close the loopholes, and that is why this is a day of \\ngreat triumph for the gun safety movement that has swept America in \\nresponse to Parkland, Las Vegas, Newtown, and the other massacres that \\nour people have endured.\\n  Second, this legislation is perfectly constitutional. As Justice \\nScalia found for the Supreme Court in the District of Columbia v. \\nHeller decision, the Second Amendment permits reasonable regulation to \\nexclude from gun ownership violent felons, the mentally unstable, and \\nso on.\\n  Despite all of the solemn invocations of the Second Amendment that we \\ncontinue to hear bouncing off of the walls of Congress, the opponents \\nof this legislation could not muster a single witness to actually argue \\nthat this legislation is unconstitutional, and that includes the George \\nMason University Antonin Scalia School of Law professor of \\nconstitutional law and the Second Amendment who was brought in and just \\nexpressed her policy misgivings about the bill without articulating any \\nconstitutional analysis at all and rejected the opportunity to say that \\nthis legislation is unconstitutional.\\n\\n  The reason 97 percent of Americans favor this legislation is because \\nit is perfectly consistent with the letter and spirit of the Second \\nAmendment, and it sweepingly advances public safety at the same time.\\n  Third, this bill will dramatically lower gun violence in America. \\nMore than 90 percent of Brady background checks take less than 90 \\nseconds to complete. But these checks have literally stopped more than \\n3 million illegal gun purchases by felons, fugitives, domestic \\noffenders, the violently mentally ill, undocumented aliens, and so on. \\nEvery day, background checks stop 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers \\nfrom purchasing a gun. Imagine how much more effective this system will \\nbe when we close these gaping loopholes.\\n  Yet, even in the face of the shocking death toll which distinguishes \\nour society from the other wealthy societies on Earth, despite the \\noverwhelming public support for this legislation, and despite its clear \\nconstitutionality, our friends across the aisle oppose closing the \\ninternet, the gun show, and the private sale loopholes.\\n  Instead of getting on our side to close the loopholes, what do they \\ngive us? More loopholes. They brought us dozens of amendments to try to \\nsuggest more loopholes to the current law.\\n  That is obviously not the direction that America needs to go in, and \\nyou will hear some more about that today, Mr. Speaker. They have given \\nus a veritable loophole factory. But now is the time to close \\nloopholes, not reproduce them.\\n  Let's focus on the public safety, which is the cardinal purpose of \\nlaw in the social contract in a democratic society. Let's pass this \\nexcellent bill, and let's pass H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background \\nChecks Act of 2019, which closes the Charleston loophole, the loophole \\nthat made it possible for a guy to go out and get a gun because the \\ndealer decided to give him a gun after 3 days because they were still \\ndoing a background check.\\n  This loophole says that if it has taken 3 days or more, you have a \\nright to go ahead and get your gun. We are going to close that one, the \\nso-called default proceed provision. We are going to close that one, \\ntoo, so that we don't see any repeat massacres like the one that took \\nplace in June of 2015 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church \\nin Charleston, South Carolina.\\n  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\", cat_list={'Technology', 'Homeland Security & Immigration', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=381, text=\"  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \\nand I thank Mr. Raskin for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\\n  Mr. Speaker, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, want to reduce gun \\nviolence. I think there is just a difference of opinion on how we get \\nthere.\\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, although well-intentioned, will \\nnot reduce gun violence as Mr. Raskin said, and instead it will turn \\neveryday, law-abiding individuals into criminals and could actually do \\nmore harm than good.\\n  I grew up in a family that didn't have guns. After my dad returned \\nfrom World War II, he stopped hunting. So, because I wasn't around \\nthem, I have to admit I had an irrational fear of guns for awhile. It \\nwasn't until I became an adult that I got educated.\\n  I remember I first went to a debate where the person who was talking \\nfor gun rights said: Do you know who follows the laws? Law-abiding \\npeople follow the laws. Who doesn't follow the laws? Criminals do not \\nfollow the laws.\\n  So although well-intentioned, often laws are unenforceable, and \\ncriminals just do not follow them.\\n  H.R. 8, again, I believe is well-intentioned. But it will not solve \\nthe problem. H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the mass shootings \\nin the last 20 years, not one of them.\\n\\n\\n  I studied them because I am on the Judiciary Committee along with Mr. \\nRaskin, and we heard this bill in that committee. In most cases, guns \\nwere obtained legally. Recent attackers have passed background checks \\nto acquire their firearms, including the attackers at the Thousand \\nOaks, California, shooting; the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, \\nPennsylvania shooting; the attacker in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas \\nHigh School, Parkland, Florida, shooting; the shooting at the Pulse \\nnightclub in Orlando, Florida; and the Las Vegas, Nevada, shooting. \\nNone of these attacks would have been prevented if H.R. 8 or H.R. 1112 \\nwere law.\\n  Then, the attackers in the Columbine High School Colorado shooting \\nused straw purchasers for their weapons, an act that is already illegal \\nand has been illegal since at least the 1960s.\\n  Adam Lanza, the attacker in the Sandy Hook Elementary School, \\nNewtown, Connecticut, shooting used his mother's firearms which were \\nlegally purchased by his mother. So as you can see--and I have each one \\nof them listed how the attackers got their guns--H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 \\nwould not have prevented any of these shootings.\\n  Not only would none of the mass shootings be prevented by H.R. 8 and \\nH.R. 1112, but the Department of Justice under President Obama said \\nthat in order for universal background checks to actually work and be \\nenforceable, a Federal gun registry is needed. Yet this legislation in \\nH.R. 8 specifically prohibits a registry; thus, again, it is \\nunenforceable.\\n  The fact is criminals don't get their guns legally and will not go \\nthrough a background check to get their guns even if this bill were \\nsigned into law.\\n\\n\\n  A recent Department of Justice report of prison inmates that used \\nguns in their crimes showed that 56 percent obtained their guns \\nillegally and another 25 percent received them from family members--\\nwhich, by the way, family members are still allowed to get the guns \\nunder this law.\\n  It is obvious, then, that they did not get their guns from a gun show \\nor private sales, as Mr. Raskin is concerned about.\\n  H.R. 8 will also turn everyday, law-abiding citizens into criminals \\nif it becomes law.\\n  Let's look at the amendments that were rejected by the Democrats in \\nthe Rules Committee and in the Committee on the Judiciary that offered \\nto protect law-abiding citizens from becoming criminals.\\n  First, there was an amendment--I thought commonsense--that someone \\nthinking of committing suicide would be exempted from temporarily \\nturning over their gun to a friend, and it is not allowed under this \\nbill. They would become a criminal.\\n  So, somebody who wants to commit suicide could not transfer their gun \\nto someone else.\\n  If a law-abiding citizen wanted to let someone temporarily use their \\ngun on their own property, they would become a criminal under this \\nbill.\\n  If a farmer or rancher wanted to temporarily lend a gun to a ranch \\nhand for the purposes of ranch activities, the farmer would become a \\ncriminal under this law.\\n  If a domestic violence victim was in fear for her life and wanted to \\ntemporarily borrow a gun from a friend to protect herself, she would \\nbecome a criminal under this law.\\n  Let's also look at some commonsense amendments rejected by the \\nDemocrats that would have prevented undue burdens and duplication on \\nlaw-abiding citizens who have already passed a background check but now \\nhave to go through another background check under this law.\\n  People who have security clearances. This is the application to get a \\ngovernment security clearance, page upon page, background check, \\nextensive background check. Yet, someone who has this and has gone \\nthrough this still has to get another background check.\\n  People who have a concealed carry weapon issued by a State, they have \\nto go through another background check.\\n  People who have already gotten a gun permit from States which require \\nthem; they have to go through another background check.\\n  People who have global entry, who have gone through a background \\ncheck, they have got to do it again under this bill.\\n  Even law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers have to go \\nthrough another background check under this bill.\\n  This is placing undue burden on law-abiding citizens.\\n  Now I want to share testimony from a young woman from the Judiciary \\nCommittee. This woman was a victim of rape on her college campus. And \\nthe reason I am bringing it up is because well-meaning gun control laws \\nactually prevented her from carrying a gun to school because the State \\nshe traveled through did not allow her to carry a gun in order to \\ndefend herself.\\n  This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens--not criminals, \\nlaw-abiding citizens--who follow the law and how this young woman and \\nothers like her were actually harmed by well-intentioned gun control \\nlaws.\\n  As a survivor of domestic violence, I know all too well how hard it \\ncan be to protect oneself or find a lifeline out. My abuser often \\ncontrolled all my finances. I wouldn't have been able to pay for a \\nbackground check or a gun.\\n  Sometimes getting a gun from a friend could actually be your only \\noption; yet, unfortunately, under this bill, I tried to offer an \\namendment, but it was rejected.\\n  Now let's turn to H.R. 1112, which changes the length of time that a \\nbackground check has to be completed from the current 3 days to 10 \\nbusiness days and then another 10 business days for an appeal. So it \\ncould be 20-plus days.\\n  The reason I am bringing this up is I want to tell you a story--a \\nreal story--about Carol Bowne. She was a New Jersey woman who was \\nstabbed to death while waiting to be approved for her firearm \\napplication.\\n  She already had an order of protection through the courts, but that \\nwasn't enough. She needed more than just that piece of paper.\\n  H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the \\ncountry, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger. \\nWomen who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a \\nmonth--20 days to a month--like Carol. How many women will potentially \\nsuffer like Carol?\\n  H.R. 8 also has other problems.\\n  Unfortunately, the debate in the Judiciary Committee was cut short. \\nMany commonsense amendments were not even heard. Only 10 amendments out \\nof 100 were heard before the chairman cut off debate.\\n  Because of the rush to get this bill through, there is another \\nproblem. There is vague language that is not defined and, thus, is open \\nto interpretation.\\n  I know, in some of the amendments, the majority party has tried to \\ngive an alternative to my good, commonsense domestic violence \\namendments, but it doesn't do any good. And this is the reason; it is \\nbecause the language is so vague.\\n  It says: Under H.R. 8, a person is allowed to temporarily transfer a \\nfirearm if it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily \\nharm.\\n  The question is: There is no definition of this, so how long is a \\ntemporary transfer? Who determines that? Does the victim determine it?\\n  Who determines if there is imminent death? Does it qualify if a \\nvictim of domestic violence thinks they will be killed? Or does the \\nperson transferring the gun have to be in the same room and there be \\nsome kind of shootout and they throw a gun to them?\\n  What do ``imminent danger'' and ``imminent death'' mean?\\n  With something as important as the Second Amendment, I think we owe \\nit to the American people to do our work and take as long as we have to \\nin order to have a fair and open debate on major pieces of legislation.\\n  Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve \\nthe balance of my time.\", cat_list={'Gun Control', 'Families & Children', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=383, text=\"  Mr. RASKIN. Just to quote a small part of it: ``Firearms pose a \\nsignificant danger to victims of domestic violence, and this is true no \\nmatter who owns the firearm. Research shows that a male abuser's access \\nto a firearm increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold \\nand does not support the contention that firearm possession is a \\nprotective factor for the victim.''\\n  And there is more in here of interest.\\n  I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for her \\nthoughts on the question of sexual and domestic violence.\\n  We, indeed, have a provision within the legislation which allows for \\nan exemption from the background check requirement in cases of an \\nimminent threat of great bodily harm.\\n  The question has been raised: Does that include sexual assault, \\ndating partner violence, stalking, and so on? We thought it was self-\\nevident that it did, but, in any event, Representatives Horn from \\nOklahoma and Murphy from Florida are introducing a clarifying amendment \\nto be very specific that it is included.\\n  At that point, perhaps we could welcome the support of the \\ndistinguished gentlewoman from Arizona, because we are being very clear \\nat that point that our exception for imminent bodily harm and violence \\nincludes sexual assault and so on.\\n  I am certain that the gentlewoman's intentions are good, just as are \\nthe intentions of the offerers of the amendment in the bill.\\n  Let me just address, in case the gentlewoman hasn't decided to come \\nover to our side now, some of the general points that were made against \\nthe legislation.\\n  The gentlewoman articulated an argument we have been hearing a lot of \\nfrom our counterparts, which is that criminals don't follow the law \\nand, therefore, there is no reason to get rid of the loopholes and \\nstrengthen the law, because criminals won't follow the law.\\n  Now, the fallacy of that argument is plain to see. It is an argument \\nagainst all law.\\n  It is an argument against the law against murder because murderers \\nobviously don't follow the law against murder.\\n  It is an argument against the law opposed to theft because thieves \\ndon't follow the law against theft.\\n  But I think anyone who takes time to really study what law is \\nunderstands that the purpose of the law is to deter people from \\nnegative, socially harmful action, the way that the Brady Act has \\ndeterred more than 3 million people--felons, fugitives, the mentally \\nunstable, and other unauthorized categories--from accessing a weapon.\\n  Now, that argument sweeps so broadly that it is an argument against \\nhaving the Brady Act that we have now, and perhaps that is the \\nintention, simply to take down the law that we have got now.\\n  Another purpose of law, of course, is to punish people who violate it \\nand then, again, to send a moral message about what the social norms \\nare.\\n  And we have got social norms about driving, for example. Would we say \\nwe are not going to have driver's licenses in America because people \\nwho drive without a driver's license ignore the law requiring you to \\nhave a driver's license?\\n  It is a completely nonsensical argument.\\n  Let's come back to reality and talk about what the Brady Act actually \\nrequires the gun dealers to ask people.\\n  Here are the basic questions that are being asked:\\n  Are you under indictment for or have you ever been convicted of a \\nfelony?\\n  Are you a fugitive from justice?\\n  Are you an unlawful user of a controlled substance?\\n  Do you suffer from mental illness?\\n  Have you been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces?\\n  Are you subject to a court order restraining you from harassing, \\nstalking, or threatening your child or an intimate partner?\\n  Have you ever been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic \\nviolence?\\n  Have you renounced your United States citizenship?\\n  Are you unlawfully present in the United States?\\n  Mr. Speaker, those questions have created a dragnet that has allowed \\nus to stop more than 3 million people from getting weapons who \\nshouldn't have them.\\n  But there are these big, gaping loopholes out there that they can go \\non the Internet and get one, or they can go to the parking lot of a \\nconvenience store in a private sale and get one, or they can go to a \\ngun show and negotiate a private sale and get one without having to \\nanswer those questions.\\n  Well, the American people have spoken on this. That is really why \\nthis is the first legislation advocating gun safety to hit the floor of \\nthe House of Representatives in a quarter of a century.\\n  This is a great day for the gun safety movement that has overtaken \\nAmerica, rejecting the unconscionable toll of 100 people dead every \\nsingle day in communities across the land.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \\nThompson), the sponsor of the underlying bill, H.R. 8, who has done \\nsuch a magnificent job advocating this cause through thick and thin.\", cat_list={'Technology', 'Families & Children'})\n",

Meanwhile, criminals \\nare going to continue to get their firearms, whether it is through \\ntheft or the black market or on the street.\\n  I applaud President Donald Trump for standing with us against this \\nineffective legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''\\n  The American people want us to work together to solve this problem \\nand stop gun violence.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  I want to thank my colleague for advancing our discussion here \\nbecause I think now we are really starting to get somewhere.\\n  The gentlewoman suggested an amendment which allows for the transfer \\nof a firearm to a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault who has \\nan order of protection issued by a court. That is an extremely narrow \\nexception.\\n  Most women who are enduring domestic violence don't have a civil \\nprotection order. Part of that is because of the incompetence of the \\nlaws in a lot of States, and part of it is because they haven't had the \\nwherewithal to go and get one.\\n  But our legislation and our amendment sweeps much more broadly. It \\nallows any woman who is a victim of domestic violence, who faces a \\nthreat from their attacker, to be loaned a gun by a family member or be \\nloaned a gun by a friend until the threat is resolved.\\n  My friend suggests that there is something ambiguous about the words. \\nI just don't see the ambiguity. Their original argument attacked the \\nutility of all criminal law, saying we shouldn't have criminal laws, \\nessentially, because criminals won't follow them.\\n  This seems like an attack on law itself. Law depends upon language. \\nBut the language is clear here that if there is a threat and if you are \\nsuffering from the threat of domestic violence, sexual assault and so \\non, then you can get the gun.\\n  Who interprets it? Well, you have got the right to go out and get it. \\nIf someone were to prosecute you for doing that, the prosecution would \\nclearly lose.\\n  So I am afraid that our friends are looking for problems in this \\nbipartisan legislation which simply don't exist.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \\nJackson Lee).\", cat_list={'Families & Children', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Mr. Speaker, as a senior member on the Judiciary \\nCommittee and senior member on the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland \\nSecurity Subcommittee, I, too, am glad of the underlying discussion \\nregarding the protecting of women.\\n  I rise today to support H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act \\nof 2019, to close the gun show loophole, supported by 80 percent of the \\nAmerican people, so unlicensed dealers cannot, undercover, out of the \\nback of their trunk, sell to people who would create and perpetrate \\neither mass murders or individual abuse and gun violence.\\n  I also support H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, \\nthat would, in fact, have stopped the deaths at the Mother Emanuel \\nChurch in Charleston, South Carolina, where worshippers were shot down, \\nnine of them.\\n  To listen to the debate in the Judiciary Committee, 10 hours of \\nrebuffing these simple legislative initiatives, I beg of my colleagues \\nto stand with us. It is clear that we have an amendment, Horn and \\nMurphy, that clarifies great bodily harm, includes domestic violence, \\ndating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse. \\nWe want women to be protected and others involved in domestic abuse \\ncircumstances.\\n  My amendment that will be brought up as well will provide the \\ninformation as to how many times the FBI has had to deal with petitions \\nthat have been denied.\\n  Let us not have another 20 years before we have bills that deal with \\ngun safety legislation. Let's do it now.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule governing debate on \\nH.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019'' and H.R. 1112, \\nthe ``Enhanced Background Check Act of 2019,'' as well as the \\nunderlying legislation.\\n  These legislative proposals address and strengthen the background \\ncheck system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.\\n  A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms \\nacquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not \\nrequired to run a background check, and that 96 percent of inmates who \\nwere not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they \\ncommitted their crime obtained their gun this way.\\n  This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not \\nconduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers \\nsell a large number of guns.\\n  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make \\nit illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, \\nmanufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who \\nis not so licensed without a background check.\\n  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be \\nrequired to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary \\nbackground check before the transfer could be finalized.\\n  H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy manner to ensure \\nfirearms do not end up in the wrong hands.\\n  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \\ndemonstrated that NICS background checks are approximately 99.3 percent \\nto 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed \\nwithin 90 seconds.\\n  H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would \\nstrengthen the background check procedures federal firearms licensees \\nor dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.\\n  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a \\nbackground check on prospective buyers using the NICS.\\n  Over 90% of checks are completed within 90 seconds so if the NICS \\nsystem has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer \\nwithin ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition \\nwith the Attorney General for review.\\n  After another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms \\ndealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if \\nit has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer \\nhas no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from \\nobtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.\\n  Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or \\ntransfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days \\nhave passed, since the initial background check.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding effective action to \\nreduce, if not prevent altogether, the countless mass shootings and gun \\nviolence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.\\n  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and \\nPrevention found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight \\nyear in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.\\n  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that \\nthere were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more \\nthan 2015.\\n  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about \\n11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.\\n  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and \\nviolence deterrence.\\n  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355 \\nmass shootings in 2018.\\n  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School \\nin Newtown,\\n\\n\\nConnecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.\\n  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, \\nwith at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.\\n  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large \\ncrowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las \\nVegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.\\n  And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First \\nBaptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-\\nold Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 and injured 20 others.\\n  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, \\nresulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.\\n  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--\\nas much as 114 percent higher than other States.\\n  A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\nlooking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent \\nincrease in a State's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent \\nincrease in its firearm homicide rate.\\n  Gun death rates are generally lower in States with restrictions such \\nas safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.\\n  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.\\n  Because more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings \\nbetween 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is \\nneeded to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.\\n  And that begins with passing H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background \\nChecks Act of 2019,'' and H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Check \\nAct of 2019.''\\n  I urge all Members to support the rule and the underlying legislation \\nwhen it comes to the floor.\", cat_list={'Families & Children', 'Education'})\n",

I had a broader one in Judiciary Committee, if the gentleman \\nremembers, and Chairman Nadler told me that it was too broad, that it \\nwas too vague, so that is why I made it very specific.\\n  If the gentleman would like, I will make it broad again.\\n\\n\\n  Also in the Rules Committee, there was another amendment as well, and \\nwe are both on Rules, too, of course.\\n  There was a broader one from Mr. Scalise, who is a victim of gun \\nviolence. He had an amendment that was ruled out of order. That \\nbasically said any victim of domestic violence, which was broad, but \\nthen he had another subsection that said victim of domestic violence or \\nsexual abuse that has an order of protection. So we covered both, yet \\nit was ruled out of order. So we really tried.\\n  Now, the other thing that you brought up, that it is very clear what \\nimminent danger means, and that would cover somebody, and surely a \\ndomestic violence victim would not become a criminal under this law. \\nWell, I don't think it is very sure.\\n  So I ask Mr. Raskin, my colleague, if he would be open to removing \\nthe word ``imminent'' and just say ``danger,'' instead of ``imminent \\ndanger,'' because to me, ``imminent danger'' means you have to be right \\nin the same room, you know, and throw somebody a gun or something. I \\nmean, to me, the word ``imminent'' needs to be removed from the \\nlanguage.\\n  The other thing I would like to talk about is the number of times now \\nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: Oh, so many \\npeople support this universal background check.\\n  Well, I disagree. I disagree, because there is proof right in Maine. \\nThey had a ballot measure, and it was rejected by the majority of the \\npeople.\\n  I suppose it depends on how you ask the question, but I just don't \\nthink that when you get into the details of how it takes away our \\nfundamental Second Amendment rights and actually burdens law-abiding \\ncitizens and actually may harm people, some of these laws--like was the \\ncase with the young woman who testified in Judiciary who said that \\ngood-intentioned gun laws actually prevented her from defending \\nherself, and she was raped.\\n  So I would say I have some disagreements with some of your \\nstatements.\\n  I also want to point out that there are many things that we can do on \\na bipartisan basis, and this obviously is not bipartisan. I am a co-\\nchairwoman of the Women's Caucus in Congress, and I have talked to my \\ncounterpart, a very nice woman and Congresswoman. We really do want to \\nwork on bipartisan solutions to gun violence. I would say one of those \\nis let's really concentrate on mental health issues.\\n  Now, we have done some things in the past. We did the Fix NICS Act, \\nwhich we passed last year on a bipartisan basis, which really is an \\nattempt to fix the national background system so that local \\njurisdictions actually report when there are problems, which I think is \\nvery valuable.\\n  We also did legislation in a bipartisan manner that would protect our \\nschools more.\\n  Here is another thing we could do in a bipartisan manner. As you have \\nnoted, 3.5 million people have been stopped by NICS since 1994 from \\ngetting guns, and 112,000 were stopped just last year. But you know \\nwhat? Only 12 of those 112,000 were actually prosecuted. Why? I mean, \\nwe have laws on the books now, and we are not even enforcing them. So I \\nthink that is another thing we can do on a bipartisan basis.\\n  Again, this bill, I believe, does more harm than good. I do think my \\ncolleagues are well intentioned.

Ninety percent of those drugs are coming from across the \\nsouthern border. If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is.\\n  No one is on the front lines of this fight more than the State of \\nTexas. Since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with more \\nthan 290,000 crimes in Texas alone.\\n  When you combine the total cost of illegal immigration from \\nhealthcare services, education, and incarceration, it is over $12 \\nbillion for the State of Texas. It is over $150 billion for the United \\nStates.\\n  We are $22 trillion in debt. We will have two of our biggest safety-\\nnet programs insolvent in less than 20 years, and we are spending $150 \\nbillion on illegal immigration.\\n  We know that constructing physical barriers, when combined with boots \\non the ground and technology, are effective at stemming the tide of \\nillegal immigration.\\n  We know walls work because we have seen it when we have deployed them \\nin El Paso, San Diego, and Tucson, and we have stopped illegal \\nimmigration or stemmed the tide 90-plus percent.\\n  So, instead of letting this crisis continue to worsen, this President \\ntook action, using authority not that he invented but that we in \\nCongress explicitly gave him under the National Emergency Act.\\n  It is not like the President is setting new precedent or breaking new \\nground. Other presidents have declared national emergencies 50-plus \\ntimes, and I know President Clinton declared it a national emergency to \\nfight drug traffickers--rightfully so--and President Obama against \\ntransnational criminal organizations.\\n  This President loves this country. He wants to do his job. He doesn't \\nwant another one of our sons and daughters to die of drug addiction or \\noverdose. He doesn't want crime to run rampant in the streets of the \\nUnited States.\\n  The President understands his first job as Commander in Chief is to \\nkeep our citizens--our people--safe, and I stand with him.\\n  Madam Speaker, today I will be voting for our President, for his \\nconstitutional, legal authority to defend this country, to protect our \\nborders and our citizens. I will be voting for the safety of the \\nAmerican people today and the safety of our communities, not just in \\nwest Texas but throughout this country.\\n  Again, President Trump is doing the right thing.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \\nconsume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, when I became chairman of this committee, I vowed never \\nto do this kind of a package. I thought that each bill deserved to be \\ndebated and to be moved as a standalone.\\n  Basically, we in the House did that. Unfortunately, the Senate did \\nnot, which is why there are at least 63 House-passed bills in this \\npackage, 62 of which were passed on suspension, that have been sitting \\nin the Senate, languishing for up to a year and a half.\\n  If somebody says they don't have time to look at all the stuff that \\nis in here, there have been months that they have been able to look at \\nthis stuff as it has been sitting over in the Senate.\\n  Much of it is of parochial significance, which means it solves local \\nchallenges.\\n\\n\\n  The very basis of all the bills that are in here is to put people \\nabove government. If indeed we are going to have public lands, there \\nshould be access to those lands.\\n  That is one of the reasons why, for the first time in years, we have \\nhad some sportsmen's activities that are put into this particular bill. \\nSo the sportsmen can assume if they are on public land, it is going to \\nbe open for recreational hunting and fishing and shooting and all kinds \\nof outdoor recreation, unless it is specifically closed.\\n  And a land manager cannot be arbitrary with that. If they are going \\nto close it, there has to be a public process they go through that \\nmandates consultation with local officials.\\n  It is extremely important that bow hunters get some protection. Even \\nduck hunters get some certainty in here. For the first time, we are \\ngoing to have special days for duck hunting, for youth and veterans, as \\nwell as those who are on Active Duty.\\n  For the first time, there are real reforms of the Land and Water \\nConservation Fund. When that program was established a half century \\nago, 60 percent of all the land was supposed to go into the State and \\nlocal funds.\\n  Those are the programs that your constituents are calling you and \\nsaying: These are the good things on why this program should be \\nreauthorized.\\n  But when that cap was taken off, the amount of money going to State \\nand local programs was reduced. In the time of the Obama \\nadministration, it was down to 12 percent. Everything else was for land \\nacquisition.\\n  This bill reforms that permanently by saying no less than 40 percent \\nhas to go to those State and local funds that your constituents like.\\n  No less than 3 percent has to go to fulfilling facility recreation \\naccess. That means that we are, for the first time now, really \\nempowering people and communities, State and local governments, as well \\nas sportsmen.\\n  I have always said that I want to shrink the Federal estate. This \\nbill finally does shrink the Federal estate, in my State as well as \\nnationwide.\\n  We create four new monuments in this bill, but the right way; not \\nexpecting the President to make a declaration but, actually, for the \\nCongress to pass a bill, to debate the bill, and then to pass the bill \\nat the same time.\\n  This administration actually did use the Antiquities Act on one of \\nthese monuments--nice and cute--but we are going to do it the right way \\nin this particular bill.\\n  We are going to do wilderness the right way. No longer should an \\nagency simply create wilderness by dicta or fiat. Congress will make \\nthose decisions of what is wilderness and what is not going to be \\nwilderness.\\n  Let me talk for just a second about wilderness, because it has some \\ncontroversy in here.\\n  Over half the wilderness that is established in this section of bills \\nis in my home State of Utah, but, as Mr. Curtis will tell you, the \\ncounty commissioners, the local officials, endorse this action. They \\nare happy with it because they gain access to other areas that can \\npromote recreation and economic development, which they have been \\ntrying to get for several decades.\\n\\n  A quarter of this is also in California, in one district. So we \\ncreate wilderness in the national park, but, at the same time, we are \\ntaking wilderness study areas and releasing those at the same time. We \\nare making exchanges so that some of the lands go into trust funds for \\neducation purposes, to fund the education of our kids--something that \\nthe East doesn't need, but those of us who live in the Federally \\ncontrolled West, we desperately need to do that.\\n  For the first time we are taking EAJA, and we will actually have some \\ntransparency so we will really know what it costs for environmental \\nlitigation.\\n  These are all issues we have been talking about for years in the \\nHouse. These are issues that we repeatedly passed in the House. But, \\nfor now, we have a chance of actually making it happen.\\n  Is this bill perfect? No. It is too big to be perfect.\\n  Is the process for creating this perfect? Hell, no. But I am \\nperfectly satisfied and willing to vote for this, because without this \\nthere will be no progress. The status quo will be maintained, and that \\nis bad.\\n  Senator Graham used to say: If I am going from Washington back to \\nHouston and I get as far as Memphis, that is not bad. If I end up in \\nBoston, it is bad, but for Memphis, that is not necessarily bad.\\n  We have been complaining for years about elements that are in this \\npackage of bills, and now we have a chance to actually be positive, to \\nget to Memphis and beyond, and to actually get something done.\\n  And if someone says: ``It is not good enough; I am holding out for \\nsomething better,'' we are holding out for something that never has \\nbeen and never will be.\\n  And it puts to the lie the complaints that we have exaggerated in the \\npast. Congress is finally ready to act.\\n  We should not refuse the solutions that are in front of us right now. \\nThis is a step forward, and this, obviously, is better than the \\nalternatives.\\n  I urge adoption of this package of compromise bills that have been \\nworked out in advance, and I appreciate my colleagues on the Democratic \\nside who have worked so hard to try and come up with a package of bills \\nthat we can all support.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

One of those includes my own piece of legislation, a \\nboundary expansion for the Fort Frederica National Monument in the \\nFirst Congressional District of Georgia.\\n  Designed by General James Oglethorpe in 1733 on St. Simons Island, \\nFort Frederica was built to defend the young colony against attack from \\nthe Spanish in Florida.

Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will be voting on \\nthe President's nomination of John Ryder, of Memphis, to be a member of \\nthe Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\\n  To those of us in the seven State region that the TVA serves, it is a \\nvery important institution. Its job is to provide large amounts of \\nreliable, low-cost electricity, which is the basis for how we live and \\nhow we work. It has a lot to do with our ability to attract jobs. Its \\njob is to provide that energy in a clean way so we can see our \\nmountains and so we meet the emissions standards in our metropolitan \\nareas that allow us to attract and grow more jobs.\\n  The TVA is fulfilling its mission very well. It is heading toward a \\nposition in which it will be about 40-percent nuclear in its production \\nof electricity, about 20 percent in natural gas, and about 20 percent \\nin coal or a little less than that. It will have pollution control \\nequipment on all of its coal plants. Most of the rest is hydroelectric \\npower, and a little bit is renewable. In short, it has one of the \\ncleanest portfolios in the country, and it is continuing to do that and \\nis producing a lot of low-cost, reliable electricity.\\n  We are very fortunate to be in a region in which, as we look down the \\nroad 5, 10, or 15 years, we will be able to say to people who are \\nthinking of moving themselves to Tennessee or moving their businesses \\nto Tennessee or growing them there that they will be able to get a lot \\nof reliable, low-cost electricity--all that they need. In addition to \\nthat, they will be able to see the Smoky Mountains because the air is a \\nlot cleaner now that they have such a clean portfolio.\\n  So John Ryder's appointment is a very important appointment, and he \\nis a well-qualified man for that position. He is one of Tennessee's \\nbest known lawyers and has been for a long time. Since the late 1980s, \\nhe has been listed as one of Tennessee's best lawyers. He is well \\nrespected by everyone who knows him.\\n  Senator Corker and I recommended him to President Trump, and we know \\nhim well. Senator Blackburn, who is Senator Corker's successor, has a \\nhigh regard for John Ryder. All of us appreciate his willingness to \\nserve, and we look forward to the voice vote we are going to have in a \\nfew minutes that will place him on TVA's Board. The Board has just \\nselected a new chief executive officer. TVA is the largest public \\nutility in the United States, perhaps in the world. It is an important \\nassignment, and it is one I am delighted to recommend him for.\\n  There is one other thing, but I will not dwell on this because I \\nspoke on this Monday night. Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder has been on the \\nSenate's calendar for 9 months. He was nominated by President Trump a \\nyear ago. The problem has not been with Mr. Ryder because, as I said, \\nPresident Trump nominated him after he was thoroughly vetted by the \\nFBI. The Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee considered \\nhim, had a hearing, and reported him unanimously to the floor. Yet, for \\n9 months, he waited there.\\n  One reason is, the Democrats have consistently obstructed the ability \\nof Senator McConnell and the Republican majority to help President \\nTrump form his government. The Democrats have required 128 times that \\nSenator McConnell, the majority leader, file cloture motions to cut off \\ndebate to advance a nomination like Mr. Ryder's.\\n  Now, this is not a Cabinet position. This is not a lifetime judge. \\nThis is the part-time Board of an important institution. He is one of \\n1,200 Presidential nominees that any President has who is subject to \\nconfirmation by advice and consent. It is the kind of nomination by \\nwhich, if a committee unanimously reports it to the Senate, we will \\nnormally approve it by voice vote. Yet, on this vote, Senator McConnell \\nwas forced to file cloture a week ago. Then we had to wait an \\nintervening day. Only then could we come to this vote.\\n  This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work, and this \\nobstruction has to stop. Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford have \\nintroduced a resolution, which has been reported to the Senate by the \\nrules committee, that would cause us to adopt a rule very much like the \\none we adopted in 2013, when I worked with a large number of Democrats \\nand Republicans for the sole purpose of making it easier for President \\nObama--and his successors--to promptly confirm the men and women whom \\nhe chose to form a government.\\n  It received 78 votes. What we did at that time was simply say: You \\nstill keep the cloture motion, and you still wait an intervening day if \\nyou need it, but we reduce the postcloture time--not for Supreme Court \\nJustices, not for circuit judges--simply for sub-Cabinet members and \\nfor district judges. We would reduce sub-Cabinet members to 8 hours and \\ndistrict judges to 2 hours.\\n  On Monday night, I invited my Democratic friends to work with me in \\n2019 the way I worked with them in 2013. In a bipartisan way, let's \\nmake sure the Senate can do what it has historically done--to have \\npromptly considered and voted up or down, with 51 votes, the nominees \\nof any President of the United States for the 1,200 positions that form \\nthe government.\\n  There have been some conversations. I hope Senator Blunt and Senator \\nLankford will continue to have those conversations with the Democratic \\nMembers, but there are nine Democratic Senators, by my count, who are \\nseeking to be the next President of the United States. I hope they can \\nlook 20 months down the road and realize that\\n\\n\\njust one Republican Senator could do to them, if one of them were to \\nbecome President, what the Democrats have done to President Trump. It \\nwould be very difficult for the next Democratic President, if there \\nwere to be one, to form a government. We don't want that to happen. \\nThat diminishes the advice and consent role of the Senate. It fills up \\nthe government with appointees who are acting and whom we don't know, \\nand they are not really accountable to us. That is not the way this \\nplace is supposed to work.\\n  So I renew my invitation to my Democratic friends to work with me the \\nway a number of us worked with them in 2011, in 2012, and in 2013. \\nLet's change the rules in the right way. Let's basically adopt \\nvirtually the same rule we adopted in 2013 and allow this President and \\nany President to get prompt consideration and up-or-down votes of their \\nnominees.\\n  I congratulate Mr. Ryder on his confirmation. I am grateful for his \\nwillingness to serve, and I am sorry he had to wait so long for the \\nopportunity. The people of Tennessee and the seven State region will be \\nmuch better off for his service within this important institution.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the confirmation of John \\nRyder, as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley \\nAuthority, occur at this time.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",

The Trump administration, in taking a \\ndifferent path, moved quickly to adopt the policy of maximum pressure, \\nrallying international partners to respond firmly to North Korea's \\nprovocations. The President also demonstrated a willingness to engage \\nthe North Korean leader directly, breathing new life into our diplomacy \\nto solve this seemingly intractable problem.\\n  The President has gone the extra mile to demonstrate his sincerity in \\nwanting to resolve this issue. It was smart to bring Kim Jong Un to \\nSingapore and to Vietnam to expose the North Korean delegation to the \\nkind of economic prosperity that could be possible if he were to choose \\na new path.\\n  High-level diplomacy can carry high-level risk, but the President \\nshould be commended for walking away when it became clear insufficient \\nprogress had been made on denuclearization. Kim Jong Un now has a long \\ntrain ride home, and he will have time to reflect on the future that is \\nstill within North Korea's grasp, but the President has demonstrated \\nthat such a future must be accompanied by real denuclearization.\\n  Every country has a stake in North Korea's denuclearization. I hope \\nChina and other countries with influence over Kim Jong Un will do their \\npart to urge him to return to the negotiating table and seize the \\nopportunity to bring prosperity to the people of North Korea and peace \\nand stability to the Korean Peninsula and to the region.\\n\\n\\n                              Nominations\\n\\n  Madam President, on another matter, this week, the Senate has made \\nprogress in confirming President Trump's nominees. On Tuesday, Eric \\nMiller became the 31st circuit court judge to be confirmed under this \\nadministration. Yesterday, we confirmed Michael Desmond to serve as \\nChief Counsel at the IRS.\\n  Of course, this progress is only remarkable given the Senate \\nDemocrats'\\n\\n\\nhistoric level of obstruction. As I noted yesterday, for example, Mr. \\nDesmond's nomination earned near-unanimous approval from the Finance \\nCommittee in August of last year but only this week received a vote on \\nthe Senate floor. So many important roles are still vacant with well-\\nqualified nominees who are ready and willing to fill them.\\n  Later today, we will vote on Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator \\nof the EPA. Mr. Wheeler has spent the last year as Deputy and now as \\nActing Administrator. He has wasted no time in proving he has what it \\ntakes to lead the Agency. In drawing on a wealth of experience that \\nincludes service as staff director of the Senate Environment and Public \\nWorks Committee and a tenure at the EPA that first began back in 1991, \\nMr. Wheeler has proven his ability to advance pragmatic solutions to \\npressing environmental challenges. I hope each of my colleagues will \\njoin me in supporting yet another well-qualified nominee and vote to \\nconfirm him.\\n  Later today, we will also have an opportunity to take care of one \\nother long-overdue item--the nomination of John Ryder to the Board of \\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority. Even after being reported out of \\ncommittee twice on a voice vote, this well-qualified, uncontroversial \\nnominee was nearly subjected to a needless cloture vote this week. I am \\nglad that, instead, we will be voting to confirm Ryder and sending him \\non to work on behalf of the Tennessee Valley communities.\\n\\n\\n                           The Green New Deal\\n\\n  Madam President, on another matter, I have been spotlighting all week \\nour Democratic colleagues' hard left turn toward socialism--their \\nfixation on gaining more government control over more of our lives. \\nWith the Democratic Politician Protection Act, Washington Democrats \\nwant to control more of what Americans can say about them and how they \\nget elected.\\n  With the so-called Green New Deal, Washington Democrats want our \\ngovernment to spend more money than the entire gross domestic product \\nof the entire world on new spending programs to forcibly remodel \\nAmericans' homes, take away our cars, dramatically increase energy \\ncosts, and disarm our economy while China roars straight ahead. You \\nmight think that right there is plenty of leftwing social engineering. \\nYou might think it is enough--oh, but they aren't stopping there, the \\nDemocrats. They are going after Americans' healthcare and their private \\nhealth insurance plans.\\n  Earlier this week, House Democrats introduced a bill that would take \\naway every private insurance option that American families rely on and \\nforce everyone into a single, government-run system. Employer-sponsored \\ncoverage wouldn't just be discouraged, it would be illegal. They call \\nthis legislation Medicare for All. It is really more like ``Medicare \\nfor None.'' It completely explodes the Medicare system as it currently \\nexists. The program our seniors have paid into for decades and now rely \\non, the Democrats want gone--wiped out.\\n  Remember, by the time Americans turn 65, most have paid tens and tens \\nof thousands of dollars into the current system through Medicare taxes. \\nAccording to one estimate, Americans with average earnings who reached \\nthe retirement age back in 2015 will have paid a present value of more \\nthan $70,000 into Medicare over the years.\\n  American seniors have counted on Medicare. They have planned around \\nit, and they have paid into it with every paycheck. Yet now House \\nDemocrats have decided it is time to change the rules on them in the \\nmiddle of the game. They want to tear down Medicare until the only \\nthing left is the name and slap that name on a completely different \\nsystem that a few House Democrats invented and that the Democratic \\nSocialists of America is proud to endorse. The Democratic Socialists of \\nAmerica is proud to endorse that. Then the Democrats propose to take \\nthat new government system and pile every single American into it as a \\none-size-fits-all--long waits for treatment, higher costs, and an end \\nto Medicare as we know it--no choice, no options, and no alternatives \\nallowed.\\n  More than 170 million Americans currently get health insurance \\nthrough their employers. Surveys show that a majority is actually \\npretty happy with its own specific plans. Well, too bad. The Democrats \\nwant those families thrown off those plans. Within 2 years, their \\nproposal would make private health insurance, as Americans know it, \\nillegal across the board. It would be unlawful for employers to offer \\nhealth benefits to their employees and their families. It is right \\nthere in the bill. It would be against the law for employers to offer \\nhealthcare to their employees.\\n  Here is what it reads: ``It shall be unlawful for a private health \\ninsurer to sell health insurance coverage . . . [or] an employer to \\nprovide benefits . . . that duplicate the benefits provided under this \\nAct by the government.''\\n  How about that? We all remember ObamaCare's famous broken promise: If \\nyou like your healthcare plan, you can keep it. If you like the doctor \\nyou have, you can keep your doctor too. That was the pledge before the \\nDemocrats' policy was actually implemented. Not long after, the fact \\ncheckers named that promise their ``lie of the year.''\\n  Well, this time around, my Democratic friends are not even bothering \\nto pretend that families' lives would not be disrupted. A reporter \\nasked one of our Senate colleagues who is running for President, ``So \\nfor people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep \\nit?'' Her response? Listen to this. ``Let's eliminate all of that.'' \\nThis is one of our colleagues running for President.\\n  All the plans American families like and rely on made illegal--\\nillegal--by this bill, not just unaffordable, not just inconvenient, \\nillegal, and all to clear space for a new government takeover.\\n  So how much is this massive takeover going to cost? Well, under even \\nconservative estimates, this proposal would cost more than $32 trillion \\nover the first 10 years--$32 trillion over the first 10 years, more \\nthan the Federal Government spent on everything over the last 8 years \\ncombined.\\n  Where is that money going to come from? Well, I think we all know the \\nanswer to that: massive tax hikes on the American people, cuts to \\nservices, rationing of healthcare, broken promises, and debt. That is \\nwhere it is going to come from.\\n  Here is what one economist found in the numbers.\\n\\n       The Federal Reserve's data only go back to 1929, but it's \\n     unlikely that the government ever collected more than 20 \\n     percent of GDP in taxes. To fully fund Medicare-for-all, that \\n     figure would have to rise to more than 30 percent of GDP.\\n\\n  Now, look, I am sure we will hear the class warfare rhetoric about \\nsoaking the rich and making a small group of Americans pay for all of \\nthis, but it will not be true. We all know it will not be true. The \\nbill for this $32 trillion takeover would land squarely--squarely--on \\nmiddle-class families. There is no way around it.\\n  Even if the IRS confiscated every dollar of Americans' adjusted gross \\nincomes over $1 million--took it all--if the IRS took every cent over \\n$1 million, it wouldn't even pay for half of the proposal--wouldn't \\neven pay for half of it.\\n  Now, look, class warfare may be a favorite tactic across the aisle, \\nbut numbers are stubborn things. Math is math. The costs would have to \\nfall on the middle class. Actually, they would fall on everyone, one \\nway or another.\\n  That economist put it this way, he said: ``The simple fact is that \\nfinancing Medicare-for-all would require a dramatic shift in the \\nFederal tax structure and a substantial tax increase for almost all \\nAmericans.'' Almost all Americans.\\n  So let's sum it up. Washington Democrats want the American people to \\nfork over a recordbreaking percentage of our gross domestic product in \\ntaxes for the privilege of having their healthcare plans ripped away \\nfrom them, even if they are happy with what they have, and the middle \\nclass is going to pay for it. What a great deal.\\n  All this, and I haven't even begun to explain how this takeover would \\ncut Americans' access to care and degrade the quality of care. We have \\nall heard horror stories from abroad about bureaucrats making decisions \\ninstead of citizens and long waits for treatment.\\n  Last year in Canada, the median wait time for medically necessarily \\ntreatment from a specialist was 21 weeks--21 weeks. That is the average \\nwait time for medically necessary treatment in Canada--more than double \\nwhat it was up there just 25 years ago.\\n\\n\\n  In the UK, it is not just long waits patients have to contend with, \\nit is flatout denials of care. In the first quarter of last year alone, \\nBritain's National Health Service abruptly canceled 25,000 surgeries--\\ncanceled them.\\n  Imagine that--being fully reliant on the government for healthcare, \\nplanning on a medically necessary procedure, and being told at the last \\nminute the whole thing was called off. Welcome to socialized medicine. \\nNeedless to say, if some Democrats had their way, you wouldn't have to \\nimagine much longer.\\n  Before I conclude, I want to highlight one more thing. I suppose no \\nfar-left wish list like this would have been complete without radical \\npolicies on the issue of abortion, without trying to hurt pro-life \\nAmericans.\\n  Sure enough, this legislation would shatter the longstanding \\nconsensus--consensus--that Federal dollars should not pay for abortions \\nand force taxpayers to fund abortions nationwide. That has been the \\nlongstanding consensus. Talk about a perfect case study in the perils \\nof a Federal takeover. Talk about a perfect example of why Washington \\nDemocrats should not get the power to twist American healthcare to suit \\ntheir own radical views--$32 trillion, every family kicked off its \\ninsurance plans, no choice, no options for the middle class, just a \\nhuge bill.\\n  The Democrats are so confident the American people will love their \\nnew government plan that they feel the need to make other kinds of \\ninsurance illegal, and Democratic Presidential candidates are rushing \\nheadlong to embrace all of this--watching them embrace all of this. \\nGoodness. If this is one of their best and brightest new ideas, I would \\nsure hate to see the bad ones.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Abortion'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=542, text=\"  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, several hours ago, in the middle of the \\nnight here in the United States, we received word that the summit in \\nHanoi between the United States and North Korea would be ending \\nprematurely. Unable to reach an understanding on either sanctions \\nrelief or denuclearization, President Trump decided to walk away from \\nthe talks without an agreement.\\n  Though I don't know the details yet, and I look forward to speaking \\nwith Secretary Pompeo, I was pleased to see the President recognized \\nNorth Korea's unwillingness to strike a comprehensive deal. President \\nTrump did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal \\nfor the sake of a photo op.\\n  Just like the President, I want a deal with North Korea that will \\nbring an end to the conflict and change the course of the region. \\nHowever, I have always been concerned about the possibility of a bad \\ndeal, especially with the other pressures currently on the President. A \\ndeal that fell short of complete, verifiable denuclearization would \\nhave only made North Korea stronger and the world less safe, and it \\nwould have squandered the substantial leverage our negotiators have now \\nthanks to the bite of sanctions.\\n  President Trump must now apply the lesson of North Korea diplomacy to \\nour trade negotiations with China. President Trump must have the \\ncourage to do the same thing with China as he has done for North Korea. \\nThe President must be willing to hold the line and walk away if China \\ndoes not agree to meaningful, enduring, structural reform of its unfair \\ntrading policy. President Trump should not fall into the trap of \\nseeking a deal for the sake of a deal, especially now that talks with \\nPyongyang are on hold.\\n  What he did in North Korea was right. He must do the same thing in \\nChina--hold out because he has the upper hand--until we get China to do \\nthe right thing. Just because an accord is, for the moment, out of \\nreach in North Korea does not mean that the President should be any \\nmore eager to strike one with China if the terms are inadequate or \\nunacceptable.\\n  The President deserves credit for bringing China to the negotiating \\ntable with tariffs, but he must not squander that opportunity by \\ncutting a deal that fails to achieve American priorities. Unless China \\npromises to end its predatory cyber theft of American intellectual \\nproperty and know-how, unless China promises to stop artificially \\npropping up its businesses, unless China promises to end its practice \\nof forcing American companies to give away their IP to their future \\nChinese competitors in order to do business in China, President Trump \\nshould walk away from the negotiations once again.\\n  As important as North Korea is to national security, China is just as \\ncritical--maybe even more critical--to American economic security. \\nPresident Trump and his team have a generational imperative to get this \\none right. They have a generational imperative not to squander the \\nchance to achieve permanent reforms to China's economic relations with \\nthe world, changes that would finally put American investors, \\nbusinesses, and workers on a level playing field.\\n\\n\\n                   Bipartisan Background Checks Bill\\n\\n  Madam President, on guns, I was so glad to see the House passage of a \\nbackground checks bill. I urge Leader McConnell to take it up in the \\nSenate.\\n  Background checks are supported overwhelmingly by close to 90 percent \\nof the American people--a majority of Republicans, a majority of gun \\nowners. It doesn't take anyone's guns away. It simply says that if you \\nare a felon, spousal abuser, or adjudicated mentally ill, you shouldn't \\nhave a gun, and it takes the means to make sure that happens.\\n  Now there are so many loopholes in the background check law--the \\nBrady law, which I was proud to lead the charge on back in the House in \\n1994. Now, some 25 years later, they have found ways around it through \\nthe internet and through gun shows. Just as it was the right thing to \\ndo to close the loopholes that existed in 1994 with the Brady law, it \\nis the right thing to do to close those loopholes that have come about \\nsince the law passed. It simply updates the Brady law, which has saved \\ntens of thousands of lives.\\n\\n\\n                             Climate Change\\n\\n  Madam President, finally, on climate, in a short time, I will be \\nreturning to the floor to lead a group of Democratic Senators in \\ntalking about climate change. One of the great but positive ironies of \\nLeader McConnell's stunt to put the Green New Deal on the floor is that \\nit has inspired Members of both parties to talk about climate change--\\nmore than ever before, maybe--under the Republican leadership in the \\nSenate.\\n  Democrats are more than happy about that. We want to turn the \\nspotlight back to the issue of climate change and keep it there, where \\nit belongs. Climate change is an existential threat to our planet, not \\njust in the future but right now. We should be talking about climate \\nchange nearly every day, and more than that, the Senate should be \\ntaking bold action to address it.\\n  So I am glad at least Leader McConnell is talking about climate. He \\njust says what he is not for.\\n  So I will repeat the three questions I have asked Leader McConnell \\nrepeatedly: One, Leader McConnell, do you believe that climate change \\nis real? Two, do you believe, Leader McConnell, that it is caused by \\nhumans? Three, do you believe Congress should take immediate action to \\naddress the crisis of climate change?\\n  Until Leader McConnell puts something positive on the floor and \\nstarts talking positively, no one is going to pay much attention to his \\nstunts and his gambits, but, certainly, we Democrats are energized to \\ntalk positively about the things we want to do to deal with this issue, \\nand we will be positive and discuss positive proposals until we get \\nsomething done in this Chamber.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Technology', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=544, text=\"  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, just in getting started this morning, I \\nwanted to take a minute to mention the good news on economic growth we \\nreceived this morning.\\n  While headlines mentioned the very solid 2.9 percent growth number \\nfor\\n\\n\\n2018, if we use the measure that economists prefer, the news is even \\nbetter--3.1 percent growth from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the \\nfourth quarter of 2018. This is just more evidence that Republican \\neconomic policies are working.\\n  We lifted burdensome regulations and passed a comprehensive reform of \\nour Tax Code to put more money in Americans' pockets and make it easier \\nfor businesses to grow and expand jobs. Now we are seeing the effects.\\n  Unemployment is low. January marked the 11th straight month that \\nunemployment has been at or below 4 percent. That is the longest streak \\nin nearly five decades. The number of job openings hit a record high in \\nDecember, and, once again, there were more job openings than job \\nseekers. Wage growth has accelerated. Wages have now been growing at a \\nrate of 3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage \\ngrowth reached this level was in 2009. Median household income is at an \\nall-time, inflation-adjusted record of $61,372. The list goes on.\\n  What does all of this mean? It means more money in American families' \\nbank accounts, more jobs and opportunities for American workers, more \\nAmericans feeling hopeful about their future.\\n  Republican economic policies are making life better for American \\nfamilies, which is why it is particularly disturbing that Democrats are \\ncurrently advancing policies that would not only destroy the economic \\nprogress we have made but would severely damage our economy for the \\nlong term.\\n\\n\\n                           The Green New Deal\\n\\n  Madam President, yesterday, I came down and talked about the so-\\ncalled Green New Deal, which is a fantasy put forward by a number of \\nour colleagues on the other side. I think 11 Democratic Senators have \\ncosponsored that legislation, which the early analysis shows would cost \\nsomewhere between $51 trillion and $94 trillion over the next decade. \\nTo put that into more personal terms, that is $600,000 per family in \\nthis country--the cost of the Green New Deal.\\n  My colleague from Illinois, the Democratic whip, was asked about it \\non an interview recently, and he responded by saying that he had read \\nand reread the proposal and still doesn't know what the heck it is. \\nWell, that is an honest answer. But I think what we do know is that \\nthis is a proposal that will dramatically, massively drive up costs for \\nAmerican families. It would be a disaster for the pocketbooks of the \\npeople of this country, which brings me to my topic for today.\\n  On Tuesday, POLITICO released an article with this headline: ``House \\nDemocrats to release `Medicare for All' bill--without a price tag.'' \\nThat was the headline.\\n  This is becoming par for the course for Democrats. First we get the \\nGreen New Deal resolution without a pricetag. Now we get Medicare for \\nAll, also without a pricetag. Why? Well, because there is no way to \\nactually pay for these socialist fantasies. They sound nice, until you \\nactually look at the staggering costs.\\n  Imagine if you decided that you needed to repair the plumbing at your \\nhouse, and the plumber came and suggested that not only should you \\nrepair the plumbing, you should rebuild the house from the ground up. \\nThen he wanted you to sign on for demolition and reconstruction without \\ntelling you how much it would cost.\\n  That is what Democrats are trying to do on a grand scale here. They \\nwant to overhaul large parts of the economy and rebuild them on \\nsocialist lines, all without telling you what it will cost or how they \\nwill pay for it.\\n  Of course, while it is irresponsible, it is not surprising that \\nDemocrats don't want to discuss the pricetag for their fantasies, \\nbecause there is no way to pay for these massive government takeovers \\nwithout taxing ordinary Americans.\\n  Democrats make vague suggestions that these programs can be paid for \\nby taxing the rich. That is always the line. But the truth is that \\ntaxing millionaires at a 100-percent income tax rate would not pay for \\nthese programs. Taxing Americans making much less than $1 million at a \\n100-percent rate wouldn't pay for these programs.\\n  The cost of these programs will never be borne just by millionaires. \\nThese programs will be paid for on the backs of working families in \\nthis country. That is the pure and simple reality.\\n  A left-leaning think tank modeled a version of the Medicare for All \\nplan proposed by the junior Senator from Vermont and found that it \\nwould cost a staggering $32 trillion over 10 years--$32 trillion--and \\nit is possible that the House Democrats' plan could cost even more.\\n  POLITICO noted in their story that, unlike the plan of the Senator \\nfrom Vermont, the House Democrats' plan would also ``fund long-term \\ncare, a particularly expensive part of the health system.''\\n  But moving away from the staggering pricetag, let's talk about what \\nlife would be like under Medicare for All.\\n  For starters, of course, it would mean that Americans would lose \\ntheir private insurance, even if they like their private insurance. \\nDemocrats have been very clear about this.\\n  At a CNN townhall just this week, the junior Senator from Vermont was \\nasked, ``Will these people be able to keep their health insurance \\nplans, their private plans through their employers, if there is a \\nMedicare for All program that you endorse?''\\n  The Senator from Vermont's response: ``No.''\\n  Another Democratic candidate for President, the junior Senator from \\nNew York, was recently asked:\\n\\n       Should ending private insurance, as we know it, be a \\n     Democratic . . . goal, and do you think it's an urgent goal?\\n\\n  Her response:\\n\\n       Oh yeah, it is a goal. An urgent goal.\\n\\n  So if you like your health insurance, you definitely will not be able \\nto keep it. You will be forced into the government healthcare plan, \\nwhether you like that plan or not. Then, of course, you will be facing \\nlong wait times and likely a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, \\nand you will have fewer options if the government decides a particular \\ntreatment isn't cost-effective and shouldn't be covered.\\n  Democrats can talk all they want about generous coverage, but what \\nhappens when they don't have the money for that generous coverage? We \\nalready know this program is likely to cost more than $30 trillion over \\njust 10 years, and government programs aren't exactly known for staying \\nunder budget.\\n  What happens if it ends up costing more or if the government can't \\neven pay the $32 trillion that we know it is going to cost? Well, there \\nwill be still more taxes, undoubtedly, but also reductions in coverage \\nand care.\\n  Our Nation's current Medicare Program is going bankrupt. If action \\nisn't taken, in 2026 Medicare will not be able to pay the benefits that \\nare promised under current law. Yet Democrats are suggesting that we \\nmore than quintuple the size of the program and that somehow we will be \\nable to pay for that.\\n  If we ever do pay for Medicare for All, we will pay for it by taking \\nthe money from the American people through devastating tax increases \\nthat will permanently reduce Americans' standard of living and \\npermanently damage our economy.\\n  Like all socialist dreams, Medicare for All would quickly become a \\nnightmare for the American people.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=554, text=\"  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, our Democratic leader has set three \\nplain and very obvious questions about fossil fuel-burning carbon \\nemissions and climate change that should be easily answered by every \\nsingle Member of the Senate, and the fact that this is a problem is a \\nclear indication of fossil fuel influence in this body--the regrettable \\nextent of fossil fuel influence in this body.\\n  It was not always this way. Here is a letter that a number of us came \\nto the floor to talk about yesterday. The letter was written December \\n23, 1986. There had been hearings on climate change in the Environment \\nand Public Works Committee, and a bipartisan group of Senators wanted \\nsome answers. They wrote this letter to what then existed, an Office of \\nTechnology Assessment for the Congress, inquiring about how serious \\nthey felt this was and what could be done about it, signed by Senator \\nStafford, Senator Chafee, Senator Durenberger, and three Democrats in \\n1986. I do not believe that a Republican Senator could be found to sign \\nthis letter today.\\n  I got here in 2007, and for that year, and in 2008 and 2009, we had \\nmultiple bipartisan climate bills being discussed in this body. Over \\nand over again, there were a Democrat and Republican who got together \\nand worked to try to solve the climate problem--more than a decade ago. \\nWe have seen bipartisanship on this issue.\\n  We have even seen, in 2009, this New York Times full-page \\nadvertisement signed by Donald J. Trump, which said that the science of \\nclimate change is ``scientifically irrefutable.'' Those were his words, \\nnot mine, in 2009, which said that if we don't act there would be \\n``catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our \\nplanet''--his words, not mine. That was 1986, that was 2007, and this \\nwas 2009.\\n  Then something happened. Citizens United got decided by the Supreme \\nCourt or, to be fair to the Supreme Court, Citizens United got decided \\nby five Republican appointees on the Supreme Court.\\n  In my view, the fossil fuel industry asked for that decision, \\npredicted that decision, and they were off like a sprinter at the gun \\nwhen they got that decision. From that moment, all of that bipartisan \\nactivity on climate change here in the Senate ended, and it ended \\nbecause the fossil fuel industry was allowed to spend unlimited money \\nin politics. They found out how to spend unlimited dark money in \\npolitics. It is politically obvious that if one can spend unlimited \\nmoney in politics, one can also threaten to spend unlimited money in \\npolitics. So between the unlimited spending and the unlimited, \\nanonymous dark money spending and whatever they did in the way of \\nthreats and promises, it has been like a heart attack--flatlined--here \\nin the Senate, since that moment. It is a tragedy.\\n  In fact, if you go back to this letter for a minute, there were six \\nsignatories. We couldn't get six States to come to the floor yesterday \\nbecause one of these States has two Republican Senators, and we \\ncouldn't get either of them to come to the floor.\\n  I don't know what has happened to the Republican Party that they \\ncan't take this seriously even now--even as States like Florida are \\nflooding on sunny days, even as States see wildfires they have never \\nseen before, even as farmers are recording drought and flood conditions \\nthat are unprecedented, even as my State looks forward to 5 or 6 feet \\nof sea level rise.\\n  And then we got a clue as to what goes on here. This is a letter that \\nwas written on behalf of Andrew Wheeler, who is the slightly cleaned-up \\nversion of Scott Pruitt and who is pending before us to lead the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It ought to tell us a lot that the \\nRepublicans put up a coal lobbyist to represent the people of America \\nleading the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  What tells you a lot also is this letter of support for this guy. Who \\nis on it? These are these phony-baloney front group organizations \\nfunded by the fossil fuel industry that got together to write this \\nletter:\\n  The Heartland Institute. Koch-affiliated groups gave it $7.18 \\nmillion, and $730,000 came from Exxon. Heartland is such a slippery, \\nslimy group that they compared climate scientists to the Unabomber. \\nThat is the company that they travel in.\\n  The Cornwall Alliance. Secret funding--we don't know, but they are \\nalways in this climate-denier fringe crowd. The founder doesn't believe \\nin evolution. He said that tornadoes are a punishment from God, and \\nthat AIDS is punishment for being gay. You are running in great company \\nwith them, guys.\\n  FreedomWorks is next. They received $2.5 million from Koch-affiliated \\ngroups, and at least $130,000 from the American Petroleum Institute.\\n  The Competitive Enterprise Institute is next, with at least $2 \\nmillion given from Exxon, and Koch-affiliated groups gave at least $5.2 \\nmillion.\\n\\n\\n  Americans for Prosperity. This is basically the hit squad for the \\nKochs in politics. It is one of the largest dark-money election \\nspenders, spending more than $70 million since Citizens United on \\nFederal elections.

      "Pandas(Index=556, text=\"  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I rise today to state the obvious--to \\nstate in clear terms what scientists have been warning us about for \\ndecades. The scientific data couldn't be any clearer. Climate change is \\nreal. Climate change is here, and we are causing its devastating \\nimpacts and disruptions. Unless we start to implement policies to curb \\nour carbon emissions and to mitigate its impacts, climate change will \\ncontinue to wreak havoc upon communities across the Nation and around \\nthe world.\\n  These are facts. These facts present us with the greatest and most \\nexistential global challenge humanity has literally ever faced. There \\nare not two sides to these facts. The Earth's five warmest years on \\nrecord happened since 2014. It is not a coincidence. It is not an \\nunexplained phenomenon. It is the direct result of both our actions and \\nour inactions. Only the willfully ignorant refuse to acknowledge these \\nfacts and the gravity and urgency of what we face because of the fact \\nof human-caused climate change.\\n  Unfortunately, the current occupant of the White House and too many \\nhere in Washington can be counted in that camp. President Trump's \\ndecision to upend the Clean Power Plan and pull us out of the Paris \\nclimate accord was perhaps the most consequential representation of his \\ninward-looking, isolationist view for America. It was a dangerous \\nabdication of our Nation's leadership role on the international stage, \\nand if we choose to accept his failure to lead here in Congress, we \\nwill continue down a path toward a very real and very costly climate \\ndisruption.\\n  In the coming weeks, Majority Leader McConnell says he plans to call \\na vote here on the Senate on the Green New Deal resolution. I wish this \\nwere a genuine effort to address our climate challenges. Clearly, it is \\nnot. It is a political stunt by the majority leader to divide those who \\nactually want to rise to the occasion and who actually want to address \\nthis crisis, rather than offer up any substantive solutions of his own.\\n  The majority leader would have you believe that solutions to climate \\nchange are too costly or they are just too impractical to be taken \\nseriously. I don't know about you, but to me, it is that view that is \\nwildly out of touch and, frankly, dangerous.\\n  President Trump and Republicans love to talk about the cost of \\nclimate action. What we should be focusing on is the much steeper cost \\nof inaction and the economic benefits of America's leading the clean \\nenergy transition.\\n  As an engineer, I am certain that our capacity to confront the \\nchallenges that we face, large and small, rests heavily on our ability \\nto make policy that is actually driven by facts, by data, and by the \\nbest available science.\\n  The latest data on climate change should be deeply alarming to all of \\nus. Last fall, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \\nreleased a report based on the research of thousands of our planet's \\nleading climate scientists. It laid out in stark terms how critical it \\nis for us to find a way to limit the planet's warming. Unless we can \\nreduce global carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net-zero \\nemissions by 2050, it will be nearly impossible to keep global \\ntemperatures below a rise of 3 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the \\ncentury.\\n  I know that is a lot of numbers, but what those numbers mean in terms \\nof real ecological, economic, and humanitarian costs is incredibly \\nimportant. Global average temperatures have already risen by nearly 2 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit, and that change is wreaking havoc on communities \\naround the world.\\n  One month after the U.N. released its landmark report, 13 Federal \\nAgencies finalized the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' a report \\nmandated by Congress to study the evidence and the impacts of current \\nclimate change. That report provided clear, indisputable evidence that \\nthe destructive wildfires, the catastrophic hurricanes, and the extreme \\nflooding that we have seen in just the last couple of years is directly \\nlinked to human-caused climate change. These disasters are costing us \\nbillions of dollars each and every year.\\n  The Pentagon has correctly called climate change a threat multiplier, \\nmeaning that climate impacts will amplify the existing threats to our \\nnational security. These are massive problems today--right now--not in \\nsome far off future. We need to recognize what the science is telling \\nus. We need to recognize that the impacts and the disasters that we \\nhave seen so far are just the beginning.\\n  Things are only going to get more chaotic, more unpredictable, and \\nmore expensive unless we change our trajectory. That is going to \\nrequire global cooperation. It is going to require scientific \\ningenuity, and serious, sober policymaking based on the facts in front \\nof us to put us on a better path.\\n  I am proud that a number of my colleagues are stepping up to think \\nthrough what those actions, what those solutions, and what those \\npolicies should be. We can have a healthy debate about the best ways to \\nachieve these reductions in our emissions, but we can't credibly \\ndispute the science, what it is telling us, and the urgency of the need \\nto act. These are facts. It is chemistry. Yet, instead of allowing us \\nto productively debate those solutions, Majority Leader McConnell is \\nplanning to waste our time on a political stunt.\\n  Since Republicans took control of the Senate, they have not brought a \\nsingle bill to the floor that would address emissions--not a single \\none--and they have taken many actions that have actually made the \\nsituation worse. This is not the serious legislating that we were sent \\nhere to do. This is not problem-solving.\\n  The Senate is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. \\nWe are supposed to come together here on the Senate floor and in our \\ncommittees and think through the greatest issues and challenges of our \\ntime. We are supposed to propose and debate policies to meet those \\nchallenges. I would welcome a long overdue debate on what policies \\nwould most efficiently and most effectively address our challenges.\\n  I know that climate change often feels too big and too hard to fix, \\nbut, frankly, we all need to get out of that mindset because climate \\nchange is a problem we can solve. In fact, climate change is a problem \\nthat we must solve.\\n  The good news is that we already have the technologies and the people \\nto do it. Clean energy technologies have been evolving rapidly in \\nrecent years, and many of the clean energy technologies that seemed \\nabsolutely unrealistic only a decade ago have become\\n\\n\\nthe new normal. I see a future where my two boys will use a reliable, \\ncheap, resilient electrical grid that is 100-percent powered by clean \\nenergy because of the technologies invented in this country and because \\nof the technologies built and installed with American labor. We need to \\ninvest in actually deploying these technologies with the urgency \\nnecessary to make real progress. This should be a bipartisan priority, \\nnot only for its impact on curbing carbon emissions but because it will \\ncreate millions of jobs in communities across this country.\\n  Some States are already moving in this direction. In my home State, \\nnew wind farms and new solar generation are bringing in billions of \\ndollars of private investment. They are creating thousands of new jobs. \\nWithout aggressive, forward-looking national policies, we will not move \\nfast enough. The scale of this transformation will be gigantic. There \\nis no doubt about that. But this great Nation is up to the challenge.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=558, text=\"  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for \\nhis comments. I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly with the sentiments \\nthat the gentleman from New Mexico just uttered and the others, the \\nSenator from Rhode Island and the Senator from New York.\\n  This is an emergency situation for the planet. How do we know? We \\nknow because the U.N. scientists at the end of 2018 issued a report \\nsaying that climate change is an existential threat to our planet. Our \\nown U.S. scientists in the end of 2018 issued their own report. This is \\nthe Trump administration's scientists, much to his chagrin, who said: \\n``We must act to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, \\nenvironment, and human health and the well-being over the coming \\ndecades.''\\n  These are earth-shattering science reports about the state of our \\nplanet. These are doomsday reports, which the scientists of our own \\ncountry and the world are giving to us. Yet just 3 weeks ago, the \\n``Denier in Chief'' stood before the Congress and delivered a message \\nto the American people--not by his words but by the words he did not \\nutter, because in an hour and 20 minutes, President Trump did not even \\nmention the words ``climate change.'' He did not even mention the words \\n``clean energy revolution.''\\n  President Trump, further, has sent to us a new person to be the head \\nof the Environmental Protection Agency. Who is Andrew Wheeler? He is a \\nformer lobbyist for the coal industry. That is what this Senate will be \\nvoting on--a coal lobbyist to take over the environment of our country, \\nas the scientists of our country tell us that we are facing an \\nexistential threat if we do not take urgent actions today.\\n  Our majority leader yesterday called the Green New Deal ``foolish and \\ndangerous.'' Well, with all due respect to my Republican colleagues, \\nthe only thing foolish and dangerous about the Green New Deal is to \\nignore the $400 billion in damages over the last 2 years from \\nsupercharged storms and wildfires, to ignore the tens of trillions of \\ndollars in the damage that we will see from climate change in the \\nUnited States by 2100 if we do not act, and the hundreds of trillions \\nof damage across the entire planet if we are not the leader in creating \\na clean-energy revolution.\\n  What is dangerous, I say to the leader, is sending our men and women \\nin the military overseas to protect tankers of oil that are coming into \\nour country from the Middle East. Superstorms, wildfires, rising seas, \\nand other extreme weather events are the impacts of climate change if \\nwe do not act boldly to stop it. It isn't just dangerous; it is an \\nexistential threat to our planet, not from politicians or political \\nscientists but from real scientists--``the'' scientists--the Nobel \\nPrize-winning scientists of the whole planet and in our own country. \\nThey are telling us we are in danger, and this body has to take \\npositive action to deal with it.\\n  We have a ``Denier in Chief'' in the White House. We have a \\nRepublican leader who has brought climate bills to the floor while he \\nhas been leader, but they have been bills to make the climate even more \\ndangerous--the Keystone Pipeline bill and drilling in the Arctic \\nNational Wildlife Refuge for oil. The Republicans are today going to \\nconfirm a coal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency, \\nwhich is the Agency charged with protecting the planet.\\n  The reality is that the Republicans have no plan to deal with the \\nclimate crisis. That is why they want to short circuit this debate on \\nthe Green New Deal. Let's have a hearing. Let's hear from experts. \\nLet's hear from scientists. Let's have the evidence in the U.S. Senate. \\nThen we can decide--but, no, there will be no debate in the Senate on \\nscience. There will be no debate on the harm that is going to be done \\nif we do not act. Instead, in the same period, there will be just an \\nattempt to confirm a coal lobbyist to take over the Environmental \\nProtection Agency and to derail any real debate on the Green New Deal. \\nThat is who they are.\\n  Why is that? It is that the Green New Deal is dangerous. It is \\ndangerous for the status quo to just continue to remain in place on \\nclimate change. It is dangerous for the Koch brothers and those who are \\nused to killing every climate debate before it gets a chance to start. \\nIt is dangerous for those who want us to limp into a frightening future \\nwith no plan and no protections in place. It is dangerous for those who \\nbenefit from the continued devaluation of our workers, from the \\nhistoric oppression of vulnerable communities, and from the continued \\ndestruction of the environment. That is who would think the Green New \\nDeal is dangerous.\\n  The Democrats want to support working families and support a safe \\nclimate future in which all communities are protected. We welcome \\ndebate on proposals for how to get there, but the science is clear on \\nwhat we need to do and the magnitude of the response that we have to \\nunleash in this country.\\n  The Republicans may think the Green New Deal is just a resolution, \\nbut it is more than that. It is a revolution, and it cannot and will \\nnot be stopped. The science is driving this. It is an intergenerational \\nconcern that we are heading toward a catastrophe on this planet that \\ncould have been avoided, but we as a nation have stood on the sidelines \\nand have allowed it to happen.\\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this vote that we take as to whether Andrew \\nWheeler, a coal lobbyist, should be the head of the Environmental \\nProtection Agency goes right through the heart of whether we are going \\nto respond to the magnitude of this challenge. I do not know how anyone \\ncan vote for Andrew Wheeler given the science that has been presented \\nto us, given the danger that we now know, given the catastrophe that is \\ngoing to be created if we don't change course. This is just doubling \\ndown on a disaster. Andrew Wheeler is going to be the architect of the \\nRepublican plan to ensure that we do nothing about this climate \\ncatastrophe. The consequences could not be greater, but the political \\nramifications in the 2020 elections are going to be great as well.

      "Pandas(Index=560, text=\"  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau asked: What is the \\nuse of a home if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?\\n  We are here at a unique moment in human history when the planet is \\nthreatened. It is not just our local stream that has been polluted by \\nsome factory. It is not a river that is so toxic that it catches on \\nfire. It is not just a small section of my home State that has been \\nafflicted by some new disease in the forests. It is our entire planet \\nthat is at risk. So any Member of this Chamber who is not coming \\nforward to help figure out how to address that is guilty of vast \\nmalpractice, legislative malpractice, and moral malpractice and \\nincompetence because that is what a legislature is about. When there \\nare big problems that we face, we come together. We don't ignore them. \\nWe wrestle with the best way to take them on. That is what this \\nconversation is about.\\n  Senator Carper's resolution says three things, the first of which is \\nwe have a real problem, and it is easy to demonstrate that. We can take \\na look at all of the information we have coming from every major \\nscientific organization that tracks increasing heat on\\n\\n\\nthe planet, but maybe that is a little too complicated. Let's just ask \\na simple question. What have been the hottest years in human history? \\nWhen have they been? Were they in the 1700s, in the 1800s, in the \\n1900s? When were those 5 hottest years? They were the last 5 years--\\n2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. This is no coincidence because that would \\nbe an astronomically unlikely thing to occur. We have enough science to \\nknow why this is occurring, not just that it is occurring.\\n  It is occurring because we are generating carbon dioxide, and we are \\ngenerating methane. They trap heat. We have been told, for the better \\npart of a century, that this was going to be a problem, and the problem \\nhas arrived. It is not some theory. It is not some computer model. It \\nis not some ivory tower. The facts are clearly evident. They are \\nevident in our forests with longer and hotter fire seasons. They are \\nevident in more powerful hurricanes than we have seen before because \\nthey draw so much more energy from an overheated ocean. We see it in \\nthe spread of diseases, like Lyme disease with the spread of tick \\npopulations. We see it with changing species. We see it with glaciers. \\nWe see it with melting permafrost. We see it with rising sea levels. We \\nsee it everywhere unless you are blind to the facts. We are not here to \\nbe blind. We are here to act. So we know the problem is real. That is \\nthe first point.\\n  The second point is we know what is causing it--human activities, our \\nputting methane into the air and putting carbon dioxide into the air. \\nTherefore, we know the third point, which is our responsibility to act.\\n  So many of us have come forward and have said: Here is an idea. How \\nabout this? This will completely change the amount of carbon dioxide \\nfrom the transportation sector. Here is an idea. This would really \\nchange the carbon dioxide generated by power generation, electricity \\ngeneration. How about this? This would greatly reduce the carbon \\ndioxide generated from heating buildings.\\n  Yet, in that conversation, there is the sound of silence from the \\nright side of the aisle. Do we hear multitudinous ideas? No. We hear \\nnone. That is where the legislative malfeasance and where the moral \\nirresponsibility lies--in pretending that you can be a leader in this \\ncountry, in this Senate Chamber, and not address this major challenge \\nthat is afflicting our planet. That is unacceptable. We don't need fake \\nand phone debates on the floor of a resolution that hasn't gone through \\ncommittee. We need real discussion and real engagement.\\n  It was not that long ago that Republican leaders across this Nation \\nwere taking on this issue. H. W. Bush ran for the Presidency to take on \\nclimate change. When he got into office, he didn't end up doing a lot, \\nbut he ran on it and campaigned on it. Other leaders have said we have \\na responsibility to be good stewards of our resources. I have heard \\nthat from the Republican side of the aisle for my entire lifetime--good \\nstewardship. So why the silence now? Why the failure to look at the \\nfacts? Why the failure to bring forward ideas? This is not OK. We need \\nreal debate, real discussion.\\n  I have put forward ideas I would love to see debated, one being that \\nwe need to dramatically reduce the fossil fuels, which we own as a \\npublic, coming out of the ground. We have to lead the world, and we \\ncan't ask the rest of the world not to extract and burn fossil fuels if \\nwe are still profiting from doing so.\\n  I laid out the vision--the 100-percent mission in all sectors--and \\nhow we can get there over the coming decades. It is a 300-page bill \\nthat is full of ideas. Maybe they are not all the best of ideas, but I \\nencourage my colleagues to read them, to find ones they like, and to \\nbring forward their ideas. Where do tax credits play in this \\nconversation? Where do limits play on pollution? Where do incentives to \\ntransition to renewable energy come in? Let's have that debate as \\nserious policymakers and leaders of this country who are responsible \\nfor our Nation and for the future of our planet.\\n  Henry David Thoreau lived a long time ago, but he laid out the point \\nthat we are responsible for the health of our planet. Let's take that \\nresponsibility seriously. Let's engage. Let's debate every single idea. \\nThere are hundreds of them out there. Let's go through them. Let's \\nforge a bipartisan plan. Let's not let any industry in America \\ncontaminate the process, the political process, through these dark \\ndonations. Let's not, any party in this country, be misled from \\naddressing the serious issues before us because they are blinded by the \\nhundreds of millions of dollars falling on their campaigns. Let's do \\nwhat we have to do, what we have a responsibility to do. History will \\njudge whether we have done that which cannot be delayed.

      "Pandas(Index=562, text=\"  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, as of now, there are zero climate \\nproposals coming from Senate Republicans--none. So it becomes \\nextraordinarily difficult to debate climate change when only one \\npolitical party is committed to fixing it. I can't underscore this \\nenough. I don't know if I can sort of stage direct the C-SPAN cameras, \\nbut if I can--if they would pan out--they would see an empty Chamber on \\nthe other side.\\n  Look, if you don't like our proposals--if you don't like the \\ninvestment tax credit or the production tax credit, if you don't like \\nplanting trees, if you don't like fuel efficiency standards, if you \\ndon't like mercury and air quality standards, if you don't like \\ninvesting in high-tech research to find that next breakthrough or if \\nyou think climate change is a hoax, come down to the Senate floor and \\nmake your argument. Yet they are not even doing that. This is a \\nplanetary emergency--the most important moment in human history as it \\nrelates to the planet Earth--and the party in power is doing its best \\nto make the problem worse.\\n  Democrats want to invest in clean air, clean water, and smarter \\ninfrastructure. We have taken every chance we can to talk about climate \\nand how to fix it. Senator Whitehouse alone has given 200 speeches on \\nthe Senate floor about the climate crisis.\\n  The Republican response has been to try to make this silly, to score \\npoints about something that was posted on a Congresswoman's website and \\npromptly removed and to make false statements saying Democrats want to \\nban cheeseburgers or whatever. That is because they don't want to \\ndebate this issue seriously because they don't have ideas on climate. \\nTheir only plan is to actively, aggressively make things even worse.\\n  They need to make this debate about something--anything--other than \\nwhat it is, which is a planet in crisis; weather getting weirder and \\nworse, wildfires, coastal flooding, fisheries crashing. Pennsylvania \\nfarmers say they had the worst season they have had in 30 years because \\nof all the rain they got last year, while farmers in the Midwest didn't \\nget near enough. It is a rolling disaster happening right now.\\n  In response, here is what the Republicans have done. They have put \\npeople who make their money from pollution in charge of regulating \\npollution. They have given oil and gas companies access to millions of \\nacres of land and water that are supposed to be protected for things \\nlike conservation, hunting, hiking. They pulled the United States out \\nof the Paris Agreement, which means we are the only country on the \\nplanet not at the table when it comes to figuring out what to do about \\nthis problem.\\n  They have made it easier for companies to put methane in the air or \\nmake cars that pump pollution into the air, and instead of just leaving \\ncoal companies alone, instead of saying, hey, let's let the market \\ndecide, they are actually looking to subsidize coal because now it is \\nnoncompetitive with wind and solar, in a lot of instances, but they \\nactually want to subsidize coal so they can get another 10 or 20 years' \\nworth of fossil fuel pollution. This is not what you would do if you \\nwere trying to stop climate change. This is what you do if you are \\ntrying to make it worse.\\n  So let's take a closer look at some of the worst things on their \\nlist. First, you have to look at the people they have put in charge of \\nconserving public lands and keeping air and water clean. This week, the \\nSenate is voting on Andrew Wheeler to run the EPA. He is a coal \\nlobbyist, and I know politicians are prone to sort of overstatement, \\nrhetorical flourishes, but this guy is actually a coal lobbyist. He \\nmade his living working for coal.\\n\\n\\n  I don't know him. I presume he is an honorable fellow, but now we are \\nsupposed to believe he is the best person to keep coal companies in \\nline, to make sure they follow the rules and don't hurt the air people \\nbreathe or the rivers they fish in.\\n  If this were a movie about corruption in politics, this script would \\nbe thrown out because it was too obvious.\\n  Then there is Ryan Zinke, who was supposed to protect public lands \\nbut instead opened up oil and gas leases at the Department of Interior, \\nor the guy regulating Federal energy who denies that climate change is \\nreal, even though we can all see it with our own eyes. If you don't \\nbelieve the science, you can at least believe your own experience. The \\nweather is getting worse and weirder and more severe. He says carbon \\ndioxide really isn't a pollutant at all.\\n  So the nominees have been awful, but the policy is bad too. \\nRepublicans are trying to pull us out of the Paris Agreement that every \\nother country in the world is part of. We are not even trying to lead \\non this planetary emergency, and it means that we give the leadership \\nmantle to China to take the lead on how the world is going to fix this \\nproblem or make it worse, as if Americans should trust China to do what \\nis best for our country.\\n  Then there is the Republican effort to let polluting companies keep \\npolluting. The whole reason the EPA exists is to make sure the air we \\nbreathe, the water we drink and swim in, the land we farm on and live \\non doesn't get polluted, but Republicans have taken control of the EPA \\nto get rid of these protections, and they are telling the auto industry \\nthey no longer need to make cars that put less pollution in the air. \\nThey have gutted the Clean Power Plan so carbon pollution could be 12 \\ntimes worse in the next decade--12 times worse in the next decade.\\n  Researchers have found it would be better if we had no policy at all \\nthan if we do the things the Republicans want to do.\\n  They have let energy companies off the hook for leaking methane and \\nmade it easier for super pollutants to leak into the air. Again, this \\nis the kind of thing you might hear from a politician who is a little \\noverheated, a little overly angry, maybe taking a few liberties with \\nthe truth.\\n  This is literally what is happening. They literally put a coal \\nlobbyist in charge of the EPA. That should be enough for someone on the \\nother side to say: Gosh. I can't vote for a coal lobbyist to run the \\nEPA. Now, I don't agree with the Democrats about climate change, but I \\ncan't pretend this thing doesn't happen to my home State. I can't \\npretend Alaska isn't melting or the fisheries aren't crashing or our \\nfarms aren't having great difficulty or that the floods in South \\nCarolina and North Carolina and Florida aren't real, and so we can't \\nput a coal lobbyist in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  There was a time when the EPA and environmental protection itself was \\nnot a partisan issue. Here we are in the U.S. Senate--which is the \\nplace to solve these kinds of problems over the course of this \\ncountry's great history--and every time we come to the floor to talk \\nabout climate change, it is an empty Chamber on the Republican side. We \\nhave to do better as a country. We have to do better as a Senate. We \\nhave to solve climate change together. Future generations are counting \\non us to transcend partisanship and to have this great debate.\\n  If Leader McConnell wants to bring a resolution, which he thinks is \\nclever, to sort of divide Democrats, fine. We are not particularly \\nworried about that. We are taking this opportunity to say: Great. Let's \\ntalk about climate change.\\n  The first question to ask--the first question to ask--is, what is the \\nRepublican plan for climate change? Right now, the answer is very \\nsimple. They have no plan.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=564, text=\"  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, today I am pleased to join with Senators \\nSchatz, Merkley, Markey, and others who have spoken to highlight the \\nneed to act on climate change.\\n  I said on the floor earlier this week that the Democrats may not yet \\nagree on exactly how we must address climate change, but we all agree \\non at least three things: One, climate change is real; two, we as human \\nbeings are the primary cause of the climate crisis we face today, and \\nit has been building for the last almost 100 years; and, three, the \\nU.S. Congress--us, the House--should take immediate action to address \\nthe challenges of climate change.\\n  That is why I am introducing a resolution today that says those three \\nthings: Climate change is real. Humans are leading to this crisis we \\nface. We have an obligation in this body and the House to do something \\nabout it.\\n  Democrats believe in our hearts and our minds that it is possible to \\nhave a healthy climate and a vibrant, growing economy, and anyone who \\nsays otherwise is preaching a false choice.\\n  Sadly, with President Trump in the White House and this \\nadministration, many of our Republican friends across the aisle have \\nchosen to ignore the clear science and threat that climate change poses \\nto our children and to their children.\\n  As we speak about climate change today, this Senate is considering \\nthe nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead EPA. Under Mr. Wheeler's \\nleadership, EPA is rolling back climate regulations that will lead to \\nmore carbon pollution in the air while increasing other air pollution \\nthat triggers asthma, lung disease, and, in some cases, death.\\n  Mr. Wheeler claims these actions are needed to provide more business \\ncertainty. He believes industry is stuck in on old world order. I would \\njust say to Andrew Wheeler, as Bob Dylan once said, ``the times they \\nare a-changin.''\\n  Things have changed a lot in the last 15 years. Industry knows where \\nthe future lies, and that future is in cleaner technologies. Companies \\nare making investments now for the next 10 and 20 years down the road. \\nThey see where the global markets are going. They need to invest in \\nclean energy or be left behind.\\n  Yet, even when industries ask this administration to support climate \\npolicies that will help the bottom line of those businesses, in too \\nmany instances, Mr. Wheeler seems to turn a blind eye. In fact, there \\nare policies that this administration could support today, right now; \\npolicies that would dramatically help our climate and our economy.\\n  One of those policies is the ratification of something called the \\nKigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol. You say stuff like that, and \\nmy colleagues' eyes glaze over. So I want to take a minute to talk \\nabout what they mean.\\n  The Montreal Protocol, ratified by the United States in 1988, is a \\nglobal environmental agreement mainly focused on phasing down emissions \\nthat contributed to the hole in the ozone layer. It was not that long \\nago--about the time our pages here were born--that it was a burning \\nissue.\\n  Ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons--we call them \\nCFCs for short--were often found in the coolants used to cool food in \\nhousehold refrigerators and the air-conditioners in our homes and in \\nour cars. CFCs are also found in foams and solvents used in industrial \\nprocesses.\\n  If there was a poster child for a successful global agreement, I \\nthink the Montreal Protocol--which most people never heard of--has to \\nbe that poster child. This agreement has led to a 97-percent reduction \\nin the global consumption of ozone-depleting substances with little, if \\nany, economic disruption. Think about that.\\n  Over the years, every administration since the Reagan administration \\nhas supported the Montreal Protocol and the four amendments associated \\nwith it.\\n  However, it turns out a majority of the ozone-depleting substances \\nare actually being replaced by something called HFCs, \\nhydrofluorocarbons. Those HFCs are easy to use. They are efficient. \\nThey are safe for the ozone layer. That is good.\\n  Unfortunately, there is a catch. The HFCs have a global warming \\npotential that is thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. On \\nthe one hand, they are good for the ozone layer; on the other hand, \\nthey are a killer when it comes to carbon dioxide. So some really smart \\npeople decided to see what they could do about this, and what those \\nsmart people did is they came up with a follow-on product to HFCs.\\n  It is estimated that left unchecked, HFCs could account for \\napproximately\\n\\n\\n20 percent of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050, and that ain't good. So \\nby using HFCs, we are fixing one global environmental problem--the hole \\nin the ozone--but we are contributing to another, and that is just as \\nserious.\\n  To address this negative side effect, on October 15, 2016, in a place \\ncalled Kigali, which is in Rwanda--that is why they call it the Kigali \\namendment or Kigali treaty--more than 170 countries agreed to amend the \\nMontreal Protocol, including ours.\\n  The goal of this agreement is to achieve more than an 80-percent \\nreduction in global HFC production and utilization by 2047. It doesn't \\nsay you have to stop using it tomorrow. This is a phaseout and a \\nphasedown. If we don't do anything by 2047, we will see an increase of \\nabout half a degree Celsius--that is almost a full degree Fahrenheit--\\nin global warming by the end of this century. We can't afford to do \\nthat. Our planet can't afford to do that. Our kids, our grandchildren \\ncannot afford for us to do that.\\n  U.S. industry strongly supports the Kigali amendment because U.S. \\ncompanies have already invested billions of dollars in order to be able \\nto produce the next-generation technologies that are going to replace, \\nover time, HFCs. Phasing down HFCs allows U.S. companies to capture a \\nlarge portion of a global market that is--listen to this--$1 trillion \\nin size, which will create 150,000 new direct and indirect American \\njobs in less than a decade.\\n  These new jobs are expected to generate close to $39 billion \\ndollars--$39 billion--in annual economic benefits for our country; \\nagain, in less than a decade.\\n  Industry also believes ratification of the Kigali treaty will \\nmitigate unfair Chinese dumping of HFCs in the United States, hurting \\nour businesses.\\n  Ratification of the Kigali amendment is a no-brainer, and even those \\nwho are skeptical about climate change ought to be able to admit that \\nit would be great for U.S. competitiveness and good-paying American \\njobs.\\n  This is a real win-win situation. If we don't seize the opportunity, \\nwe should have our heads examined. That is why we have some pretty \\nstrange bedfellows supporting the Kigali ratification.\\n  There is a chart behind me. Among others, we have the National \\nAssociation of Manufacturers, Natural Resources development folks, the \\nspirit of enterprise, FreedomWorks, the American Chemistry Council, \\nBusiness Roundtable, and Sierra Club.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=568, text=\"  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as strange as it seems, socialism is \\nhaving a bit of a resurgence here in the Nation's Capital these days.\\n  Why, you might ask, has this failed economic theory that is so \\ndestructive of individual freedom captured the attention of some of our \\nfriends in the Democratic Party? I admit, to me, it is somewhat of a \\nmystery.\\n  My guess is I am not the only one who assumed that every American has \\nlearned the lessons of history and that those lessons are common \\nknowledge. Apparently not. One other possibility is that socialism is a \\nstalking horse for other, less obvious goals. I will have more to say \\nabout what the Founders believed about the concentration of government \\npower that would be needed to implement these utopian schemes at a \\nlater time. I also will return to the Senate floor at another time to \\ntalk about the well-funded efforts, including in the State of Texas, to \\nadvance the cause of socialism, unbeknownst to most of my fellow \\nTexans.\\n  Maybe self-identified socialists or democratic socialists--by the \\nway, that is an impossible contradiction in terms. You can't be \\ndemocratic and a socialist at the same time. Obviously, people put \\nthose two terms together to try to mask their true intentions.\\n  Obviously, these self-identified democratic socialists have never \\nlearned what it is or what it stands for. Recent polling suggests that \\nAmericans have vastly different ideas about what socialism really \\nmeans. A Gallup poll, for example, found that 23 percent of the people \\nwho responded understood that it means economic equality--though the \\ndefinition of what equality looks like varies pretty significantly. \\nAbout the same number of people said they didn't know or had no opinion \\nof what socialism means. Roughly 17 percent understand it to mean \\ngovernment ownership or control of business and the economy.\\n  There were a variety of answers, ranging from government-guaranteed \\nbenefits to communism, to people simply being social and getting along. \\nThat is what some people think socialism is. This confusion about what, \\nexactly, socialism is has allowed its supporters to push this \\ndiscredited idea back into the political mainstream.\\n  The so-called democratic socialists are trying to convince the \\nAmerican people that bigger government and less liberty are the \\nsolutions to economic inequality. But they don't just want economic \\nopportunity or equal opportunity; they want equal outcomes. They \\nclearly want to put the government in charge of Americans' lives.\\n  To be sure, they will not be honest about the means by which that \\nequality would be accomplished under socialism. They use a lot of feel-\\ngood phrases to mask the consequences of their argument. They say \\nthings like ``give a voice to the voiceless'' or ``to achieve a more \\njust society.'' What they don't tell you is that in order to \\nredistribute economic benefits, you would have to marshal the power of \\nthe government to coerce the American people to give up the fruits of \\ntheir labor in pursuit of socialist, utopian aims.\\n  While socialists will not tell you what the government would have to \\ndo to force that redistribution, they like to point to Scandinavian \\ncountries as a model for socialism's success. But there are some \\nproblems with that.\\n  They will say: Look at Denmark. They have free higher education, \\nuniversal healthcare, and subsidized childcare, and they are doing \\ngreat. So, they say, socialism works. But facts are stubborn things. \\nFor one, Denmark is not a socialist country. Just ask the Danish Prime \\nMinister, who said:\\n\\n       Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is \\n     a market economy.\\n\\n  The left argues: It is still a good model. We want that.\\n  OK, so how are they paying for all of these programs? It is certainly \\nnot just from the top 1 percent of the wealthiest of Americans. It is \\nthe middle class too. Margaret Thatcher once said: ``The problem with \\nsocialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.''\\n\\n  Let's look at tax rates. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the \\nworld. In the United States, tax revenue accounts for just over a \\nquarter of the size of our economy. In Denmark, it is 50 percent--or \\ndouble.\\n  Let's also compare our two countries. The population of the country \\nof Denmark is roughly 1/60th the population of the United States. In \\nterms of landmass, it is about 16,000 square miles. Texas is almost 17 \\ntimes the size of Denmark.\\n  So if the model used in Denmark is, one, not socialism and, two, \\nunaffordable, let's instead look for a better example of a country that \\nhas embraced socialism. I would suggest Venezuela would be a good \\ncandidate.\\n  In the late 1990s, then-Presidential Candidate Hugo Chavez delivered \\nimpassioned speeches promising to lead Venezuela into a socialist \\nparadise. He talked about the country's wealth being stolen by evil \\ncapitalists and greedy corporations and promised hope and change if he \\nwas elected. That sounds similar to some of the snake oil being sold by \\na number of radical Democrats today. By the way, you don't see caravans \\nof people attempting to immigrate to socialist countries like \\nVenezuela. It is just the opposite.\\n  We now know that Chavez's promises were empty and dangerous, and \\nwhile Venezuela certainly saw a lot of change, it wasn't the kind they \\nwanted or the kind they expected. The government took over businesses; \\nthey shut down free markets; and they suppressed free speech. As a \\nresult, one of the richest countries in the world is now among the \\npoorest. Basic commodities like food, medicine, and water are in short \\nsupply; freedom of the press has disappeared; crime rates have \\nskyrocketed; and millions have fled.\\n  Of course, it is no surprise that self-proclaimed socialists in the \\nUnited\\n\\n\\nStates refuse to accept this as an example of socialism. But this is \\nthe truth. That is why socialism must be soundly rejected.\\n  Sir Winston Churchill, who had an incredible gift for words, once \\nsaid:\\n\\n       The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of \\n     blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal \\n     sharing of miseries.\\n\\n  Clearly, misery would be a result of a current fad celebrating \\nsocialism, and we must firmly and clearly reject it.\\n  In a society like ours, based on the free enterprise system, business \\nowners compete for business and make decisions based on what the \\ncustomer wants and needs, and this helps keep the cost of living low \\nwhile offering consumers choice.\\n  Competition and free enterprise are the opposite of centrally planned \\nand administered socialist economies and the only economic system \\ncompatible with individual liberty.\\n  In a socialist country, the government owns or controls everything. \\nIf you don't like it or insist on going your own way, you will be \\nsquished like a bug. Socialism forces citizens to be submissive to the \\ngovernment's plan--a far cry from the freedoms and liberties promised \\nunder our Constitution.\\n  Most Americans don't want the government to run their lives. They \\nwant less government, which is to say they want more freedom. So while \\nthings like free healthcare or free higher education or free housing \\nsound pretty good superficially, they are a fantasy and part of the \\nagenda to move the United States toward a socialist, government-\\ncontrolled economy.\\n  Under our free enterprise system, people work to earn their living. \\nThe harder you work, the more you benefit and the better you can \\nprovide for yourself and your family. That is something we call the \\nAmerican dream. But with socialism, that kind of motivation doesn't \\nexist at all. Why would you put in the extra effort? Why would you work \\nlonger hours when you will receive the same pay and benefits as \\neverybody else? Why would you pursue an advanced degree and pour your \\nheart into researching new medical cures when you know, at the end of \\nthe day, the person who chooses to do nothing will receive the same \\nbenefits you do? Well, you wouldn't. That is why socialism doesn't \\nwork.\\n  In a recent Washington Post column, George Will defined today's \\nunderstanding of socialism as this:\\n\\n       Almost everyone will be nice to almost everyone, using \\n     money taken from a few. This means having government \\n     distribute, according to its conception of equity, the wealth \\n     produced by capitalism.\\n\\n  The problem is, as he said, the government will take and take until \\neventually there is nothing more to take. Once that happens, the \\neconomy will tank; jobs will dry up; taxes will get higher to pay for \\nthe benefits promised; and those utopian sentiments will not feel quite \\nso good anymore.\\n  The enemy of socialism isn't greed. It is experience. That is why \\nthere are no socialist success stories. Venezuela, the Soviet Union, \\nEthiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania--time and again, we have seen socialism \\nfail. That has been the universal experience.\\n  As President Trump said in Miami last week:\\n\\n       Socialism promises prosperity, but it delivers poverty. \\n     Socialism promises unity, but it delivers hatred and it \\n     delivers division. Socialism promises a better future, but it \\n     always returns to the darkest chapters of the past.\\n\\n  Slapping the word ``democratic'' in front of the word ``socialism'' \\ndoesn't make it any less radical or any less terrifying. In fact, \\ndemocracy and socialism are at war with each other.\\n  This is not about lifting up the poor. It is about taking our freedom \\naway and turning it over to our government overlords and taskmasters.\\n  As so many seem to have forgotten the lessons of history, I plan to \\nreturn to the Senate floor to discuss this disturbing trend further and \\nremind the American people why socialism is the enemy, not a friend, of \\nour country.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Welfare & Poverty', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=572, text=\"  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, throughout the country and in the great \\nState of Illinois, a host of environmental issues are plaguing \\nAmericans. From air pollution, to groundwater contamination, to the \\nincreases in climate change-related harm that we are already facing, \\nthere is no more crucial time to have strong national leadership on \\nenvironmental issues than right now. However, in the midst of all these \\nissues comes the nomination of Andrew Wheeler--a former lobbyist for \\ncorporate polluters--to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  If there is one major thing we have learned from the Clean Air Act, \\nit is that regulations save lives and money. Regulations that ensure \\nclean air mean fewer premature deaths and health issues, as well as \\nfewer asthma attacks in children and health-related missed work days. \\nHowever, the EPA under this administration that is now led by Acting \\nAdministrator Wheeler, consistently works to roll back clean air and \\nwater rules. This exposes the most vulnerable members of our society--\\nincluding children and the elderly--to toxic and deadly chemicals. The \\npeople in Illinois are no exception. We are facing several \\nenvironmental issues in Illinois that require immediate action by the \\nEPA, and so far, I am not satisfied that EPA is doing everything it can \\nand should be doing under Mr. Wheeler's leadership.\\n  The Sterigenics facility is causing is a public health threat in \\nWillowbrook, IL due to emissions from cancer-causing ethylene oxide. \\nThe EPA's own risk assessment from 2016, showed that ethylene oxide \\nexposure increases the risk of cancer more than what was previously \\nthought. However, given this\\n\\n\\ninformation, the EPA has still not taken sufficient actions to protect \\npeople of Willowbrook who are exposed to this gas. Concerns about \\nethylene oxide exposure is not limited to the people of Willowbrook--it \\nis also of concern to the people of Gurnee and Waujkegan, IL who also \\nhave plants that use ehtylene oxide in the middle of their towns. Every \\ntime I have spoken with Acting Administrator Wheeler about this issue, \\nI have been disappointed by the lack of urgency to do anything more \\nthan monitor and collect more data. When it comes to the facilities in \\nGurnee and Waukegan, the EPA won't even commit to monitor and collect \\ndata, even though I have joined my colleague Senator Duckworth in \\nrequesting that monitoring begin immediately. The EPA is 4 years \\noverdue to begin the process to promulgate new standards for this gas, \\neven though they know the increased cancer risk. So I, along with my \\ncolleague Senator Duckworth and my colleagues in the House, introduced \\nlegislation to require the EPA to promulgate new rules for ethylene \\noxide. However, the EPA's failure to act to limit toxic chemicals being \\nemitted into neighborhoods does not end with ethylene oxide. There is \\nmanganese pollution on the Southeast side of Chicago. Manganese \\nexposure results in serious neurological effects, such as learning \\ndifficulties, lower IQ scores in children, and manganese poisoning--a \\ncondition that resembles Parkinson's disease. There are several \\nfacilities on the Southeast side of Chicago that emit manganese, and \\nEPA is now monitoring these facilities after my colleague Senator \\nDuckworth and I pressed EPA to do so. These facilities contaminate both \\nthe air that people breathe and the soil that children play on.\\n  Although the EPA knows how dangerous this neurotoxin is and how high \\nthe concentrations are, they will not commit to strengthening manganese \\nstandards or take immediate action to clean up sites with soil \\ncontamination. We need someone at the EPA that will be aggressive in \\nenforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.\\n  We also need an EPA Administrator who recognizes how urgent it is to \\naddress climate change. The Trump administration's own Department of \\nDefense issued a report last month identifying national security \\nthreats to defense missions, operations, and installations, due to \\nclimate change. Yet Acting Administrator Wheeler continues to undermine \\nindependent science for climate change by appointing members to the \\nEPA's Scientific Advisory Board who are biased by industry or actively \\ndeny that climate change is a problem. How can we expect the EPA to \\nlead efforts to address climate change if its leadership doesn't \\nbelieve it requires immediate action?\\n  I would also like to mention one more thing before I close. This \\nadministration promised farmers, biorefineries, and fuels stations that \\nthey would ensure stations could sell E15 fuels this summer. The EPA is \\ncoming close to failing to fulfil that promise. I hope the EPA will \\nwork with me to ensure stations are able to sell E15 fuels this summer.\\n  We need someone leading the EPA who will put the health and well-\\nbeing of the people of this country above the profits of corporate \\npolluters. We need someone who is willing to protect families and \\ncommunities from toxic chemicals in our air and water by fully \\nenforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. And we need \\nsomeone who will lead the charge to address climate change. I am not \\nconvinced that Acting Administrator Wheeler will do these things. As a \\nresult, I cannot support his nomination. I hope he proves me wrong.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=573, text=\"  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my \\nopposition to confirming Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of \\nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  His lobbying activities and tenure, first as Deputy, then as Acting \\nAdministrator, show that he should not be leading the EPA in a \\npermanent capacity.\\n  We are at a crossroads for action on climate change. The United \\nNations issued a special report in October, warning of the catastrophic \\nconsequences of allowing global warming to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n  The report warned that human activity has already caused about 1 \\ndegree of warming and that we need to drastically cut emissions--45 \\npercent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050--to stay below 1.5 degrees.\\n  The EPA is the strongest institution we have in the United States to \\ncombat climate change in terms of technical expertise and legal \\nauthority. Unfortunately, I fear that, if the EPA remains under the \\nleadership of Andrew Wheeler, it will continue dismantling critical \\nregulations and rolling back previous efforts to address climate \\nchange.\\n  Andrew Wheeler is a former coal and fossil fuel lobbyist. Despite a \\nduty to serve the public's interest, he has instead worked to push a \\ncounterproductive agenda of deregulation at the EPA.\\n  During Mr. Wheeler's EPA tenure, the Trump administration has \\naggressively moved to undermine numerous greenhouse gas emission \\nregulations. This includes President Obama's landmark Clean Power Plan, \\nperformance standards for new power plants, and methane emission \\nstandards for the oil and gas industry.\\n  I am most concerned that Andrew Wheeler is overseeing the Trump \\nadministration's efforts to roll back our national program for motor \\nvehicle emission standards, an issue that I have worked on for decades.\\n  Under the current program, fuel economy standards for new cars and \\nSUVs are set to exceed 50 miles per gallon by 2025. To date, these \\nstandards have saved 550 million barrels of oil, $65 billion in fuel \\ncosts for American families, and 250 million metric tons of carbon \\ndioxide.\\n  The success of these standards comes, in part, from the fact that \\nthey have been implemented as a single, coordinated national program \\nunder the authority of the EPA, the Department of Transportation, and \\nthe State of California.\\n  The Department of Transportation implements the Ten-in-Ten Fuel \\nEconomy Act, which was signed into law in 2007 following a bipartisan \\nlegislative effort over the course of many years. I was proud to work \\ntogether with our former colleague Olympia Snowe of Maine and many \\nothers from both parties to strengthen the Corporate Average Fuel \\nEconomy standards for the first time in three decades.\\n  This law requires fuel economy standards to increase by at least 10 \\nmiles per gallon by 2020. Beyond 2020, the law requires standards to be \\nset at the maximum feasible level based on available technology, which \\nthe administration is trying to avoid doing for 2022-2026.\\n  For its part, the EPA implements complementary vehicle emission \\nstandards under the Clean Air Act. That law also recognizes \\nCalifornia's longstanding authority to regulate its own air pollution \\nand allows other States to choose to follow California's standards in \\nlieu of Federal requirements, as 13 States have now done.\\n  Today these standards are collectively implemented as a single \\nnational program under a 2012 agreement between the Department of \\nTransportation, the EPA, and the State of California that applies \\nthrough model year 2025.\\n  Unfortunately, the Trump administration is working to tear up that \\nagreement and weaken Federal standards starting in 2022. Last week, the \\nadministration announced it would refuse to negotiate with California \\nto salvage this program. Instead of seeking consensus, the EPA, \\noverseen by Mr. Wheeler, is proposing to challenge California's \\nlongstanding authority. These actions are unjustified and will only \\ncreate chaos and uncertainty for the automobile market.\\n  Under Mr. Wheeler's watch, the Trump administration has also \\ncontinued to roll back or undermine many other important EPA \\nenvironmental health and safety regulations.\\n  From attempts to undermine effective Mercury and Air Toxics \\nStandards, to evading the EPA's commitments to set safe drinking water \\nstandards, to failing to fully implement the Toxic Substances Control \\nAct, it is clear that Mr. Wheeler will only continue his efforts to \\ndismantle the EPA from within.\\n  I was a proud supporter of the bipartisan Frank R. Lautenberg \\nChemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which passed in 2016. This \\nbill amends and updates the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the \\nNation's primary\\n\\n\\nchemicals management law. Thousands of Californians rely on it to \\nsafeguard against exposure to toxic chemicals we encounter every day.\\n  EPA is charged with protecting all Americans from undue and harmful \\nexposure to existing and newly introduced chemicals. However, under the \\nTrump administration, the EPA's safety reviews of toxic substances has \\nfallen far short of the intent of this sweeping, bipartisan toxic \\nchemical reform legislation.\\n  One example of a chemical that I am very concerned about is asbestos. \\nAs a result of the administration's lack of action, my colleagues in \\nthe Senate and I introduced legislation in 2017 that would have amended \\nthe Toxic Substances Control Act to require the EPA to identify and \\nassess all forms of asbestos and ultimately ban this known carcinogen.\\n  This bill was named after Alan Reinstein, who passed away in 2006 at \\nthe age of 66 from mesothelioma, a disease caused by exposure to \\nasbestos. Delays in banning asbestos have meant that as many as 15,000 \\nAmericans die each year from exposure.\\n  During Wheeler's tenure, the EPA has resisted calls to eliminate \\nexemptions for asbestos in the current Chemical Data Reporting rule, a \\nreporting requirement under the Toxic Substances Control Act, to comply \\nwith its mandate to prevent unreasonable risks to health and the \\nenvironment presented by asbestos.\\n  Despite knowing the health risks for decades, asbestos is still used \\nin a wide variety of construction materials that the public unwittingly \\ncomes into contact with every day.\\n  Andrew Wheeler's tenure at the EPA, both as Deputy Administrator for \\nthe EPA and as Acting Administrator, has shown a clear disregard for \\nthe EPA's mission to protect the public and the environment.

Thank you very much, Madam President.\\n  Madam President, we are going to vote in just a few minutes to \\nconfirm Andrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental \\nProtection Agency. There is no one better to serve in this role, and I \\nwould know. Andrew worked for me for 14 years in both my personal \\noffice as well as in my capacity as chairman of the Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee.\\n  He was with the committee back when President Trump nominated Andrew \\nas Deputy Administrator. I said: There is no one more qualified. There \\nis no one more qualified anywhere in America to handle this job than \\nAndrew Wheeler.\\n  He has been Acting Administrator for the last 7 months. Let's keep in \\nmind that he was the most qualified person 7 months ago, and now he has \\nhad 7 months on the job, and he has done a really great job. He has \\nbeen the Acting Administrator.\\n  It didn't really start when he came on board with any of the \\ngovernmental Agencies. He has always been concerned about nature and \\nthe environment. The guy was an Eagle Scout.\\n  In fact, I remember the discussions of people who were with him when \\nhe was actually climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. It was with a group of \\npeople who were interested in nature and the environment. This came \\nearly on with him. So he has the ability to lead the Agency.\\n  I have always enjoyed following his career. After earning a law \\ndegree at Washington University in St. Louis, he joined the EPA as a \\nspecial assistant in the Agency's Pollution Prevention and Toxics \\nOffice in 1991. I am talking about 30 years ago. This guy has been \\nthere for a long time. For all practical purposes, he has grown up in \\nthat particular discipline.\\n  He was an EPA employee for 4 years, transitioning to the George H. W. \\nBush administration and then the Clinton administration after that, \\nwhere he earned three Bronze Medals for commendable service along the \\nway.\\n  By the way, I doubt if there are too many people in this Chamber who \\nknow what that is. So I am going to read it to you.\\n  The Bronze Medal is given for ``significant service or achievements \\nin support of the Agency's mission or for demonstration of outstanding \\naccomplishments in supervision and leadership.''\\n  That is Andrew Wheeler. He received three of those.\\n  I know you have heard a lot of people opposing him. Regretfully, \\nthere are a lot of people opposed simply for the reason that this is a \\nnominee of the President. We went through this with Mr. Kavanaugh. We \\nheard all of these things, and people now look back, and many of them \\nregret that they said the things that they said.\\n  It is awfully hard to be critical of Andrew because he is such a nice \\nguy.\\n  He left the Agency. He brought the sense of service and leadership \\nwith him to the U.S. Senate, where I had a front-row seat because he \\nworked for me for 14 years.\\n  He just did really tremendous work. There were never any complaints \\nabout him. He knew what he was doing. Again, with a 31-year background, \\nthere is nothing that he doesn't know about the mission.\\n  Andrew started in my personal office as chief counsel and \\ntransitioned to staff director for a Senate subcommittee. I was a \\nsubcommittee chairman at the time on the subcommittee called the Clean \\nAir, Climate Change, Wetlands, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. He was \\nthe one who did all the work, and I took the credit, but it worked.\\n  In 2003, when I became the chairman of the Environment and Public \\nWorks Committee, Andrew became our chief counsel. Over the next 6 \\nyears, he would eventually become staff director and we worked closely \\ntogether on highway bills, energy bills, the Diesel Emissions Reduction \\nAct, and the Clear Skies Act.\\n  I can remember when this was taking place because someone who was a \\nvery close friend of mine and is no longer here, Barbara Boxer from \\nCalifornia, worked together on these things. It was really kind of \\nfunny. Philosophically, we were opposed to each other as much as two \\npeople could be, but we accomplished everything. We accomplished the \\nthings that other people were not able to accomplish.\\n  It is only natural that the President would nominate Andrew to be the \\nDeputy Director at that time of the EPA. That was last April. He was \\nconfirmed in a bipartisan vote.\\n  I will always remember that he gave a speech over at the EPA. It was \\nkind of a welcome speech at that time. That was the day that he was \\nconfirmed as Deputy Director of the EPA. I think every single employee \\nwas in there, really, to kind of pay homage to him. It is a big deal. \\nHere is a guy who started 30 years ago at the bottom. He is just a \\nnormal person in the bureaucracy, and all of a sudden--not all of a \\nsudden, it took him almost 30 years to do it--he climbs up to become \\nDeputy Director. So he was really a model. He was a model to those 200 \\nor 300 people.\\n  Andrew didn't even know this as he was making his initial speech, but \\nI watched the looks on their faces, and the model that he was for them \\nwas that there is room at the top. Here is a guy who climbed all the \\nway up, and he reached the top.\\n  He knows what it takes to ensure that our environment is cared for \\nwithin the laws passed by Congress. He will ensure that all \\nstakeholders are heard, and he will provide certainty and stability for \\nthe regulated community. That is a switch.\\n  One of the reasons I ran for Congress in the first place many years \\nago was the fact that I was a builder and developer and I was \\noverregulated. I know what it is like firsthand. He will be a good \\nsteward of the environment without punishing our States, without \\npunishing our farmers, and without punishing our job creators just for \\nthe sake of it. Those days are behind us.\\n  Andrew has worked on these issues for his entire 28-year career, and \\nI am honored that he chose to spend half of his 14 years working for \\nme. So I have directly benefited from his service. The U.S. Senate has \\nbenefited from his leadership, and now America will benefit as well.\\n  Let's vote Andrew in and put him to work.\\n\\n\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=607, text=\"  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity \\nDisclosure Act along with two members of the Select Committee on \\nIntelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Warner, \\nin addition to Senator Kennedy and Senator Jones, who also serve with \\nme on the Senate Banking Committee. In response to data breaches of \\nvarious companies that exposed the personal information of millions of \\ncustomers, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to \\ninclude--in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to \\ninvestors--information on whether any member of the board of directors \\nis a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having this expertise on the \\nboard of directors is not necessary because of other cybersecurity \\nsteps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the \\nlegislation does not require companies to take any actions other than \\nto provide this disclosure to its investors.\\n  In Deloitte's 11th Global Risk Management Survey of financial \\nservices institutions, published last month, ``sixty-seven percent of \\nrespondents named cybersecurity as one of the three risks that would \\nincrease the most in importance for their business over the next two \\nyears, far more than for any other risk. Yet, only about one-half of \\nthe respondents felt their institutions were extremely or very \\neffective in managing this risk.'' According to the 2018-2019 National \\nAssociation of Corporate Directors Public Company Governance Survey, \\nonly 52 percent of directors ``are confident that they sufficiently \\nunderstand cyber risks to provide effective cyber-risk oversight,'' and \\n58 percent ``believe their boards collectively know enough about cyber \\nrisk to provide effective oversight.'' Indeed, Yahoo, in its 2016 \\nannual report, disclosed, ``the Independent Committee found that \\nfailures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting \\ncontributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the \\n2014 Security Incident. The Independent Committee also found that the \\nAudit and Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately \\ninformed of the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014 \\nSecurity Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident \\nhere refers to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account \\ninformation for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from \\nYahoo's network in late 2014.''\\n  This is particularly troubling given that data breaches expose more \\nand more records containing personally identifiable information. \\nIndeed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of \\nthese types of records exposed by data breaches in the business \\nindustry grew from 181,630,520 in 2017 to 415,233,143 in 2018 and in \\nthe medical and healthcare industry from 5,302,846 in 2017 to 9,927,798 \\nlast year. Across all industries, the number of records containing \\npersonally identifiable information exposed by data breaches rose 126 \\npercent, from 197,612,748 in 2017 to 446,515,334 in 2018.\\n  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether \\npublicly traded companies are prioritizing cybersecurity and have the \\ncapacity to protect investors and customers from cyber related attacks. \\nOur legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues \\nthrough improved SEC disclosure.\\n  In testimony given to the Senate Banking Committee last June, Harvard \\nLaw Professor John Coates, who also practiced securities law as a \\npartner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, expressed support for our \\nlegislation by stating that ``[the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act] is \\nwell designed. It does not attempt to second-guess SEC guidance and \\nrules regarding disclosures generally, or even as to cyber-risk \\noverall. The bill simply asks publicly traded companies to disclose \\nwhether a cybersecurity expert is on the board of directors, and if \\nnot, why one is not necessary. To be clear, the bill does not require \\nevery publicly traded company to have a cybersecurity expert on its \\nboard. Publicly traded companies will still decide for themselves how \\nto tailor their resources to their cybersecurity needs and disclose \\nwhat they have decided. Some companies may choose to hire outside cyber \\nconsultants. Some may choose to boost cybersecurity expertise on staff. \\nAnd some may decide to have a cybersecurity expert on the board of \\ndirectors. The disclosure required would typically amount to a sentence \\nor two.''\\n  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking \\nCommittee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my \\nservice on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on \\nIntelligence. Through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence \\nperspective, I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our \\nnational security, and this is particularly the case as our economy \\nbecomes ever more dependent on technology and the internet.\\n  Indeed, General Darren W. McDew, the former commander of U.S. \\nTransportation Command, which is charged with moving our military \\nassets to meet our national security objectives in partnership with the \\nprivate sector, offered several sobering assessments during an April \\n10, 2018 hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He stated \\nthat ``cyber is the number one threat to U.S. Transportation Command, \\nbut I believe it is the number one threat to the nation . . . in our \\nheadquarters, cyber is the commander's business, but not everywhere \\nacross our country is cyber a CEO's business . . . in our cyber \\nroundtables, which is one of the things we are doing to raise our level \\nof awareness, some of the CEO's chief security officers cannot even get \\nto the see the board, they cannot even . . . see the CEO. So that is a \\nproblem.''\\n  In my view, this is a real problem because, if we are attacked, the \\nfirst strike will likely not be a physical one against the military but \\na cyber strike against the infrastructure of movement, logistics, and \\nother critical assets in the civilian space.\\n  With growing cyber threats, we all need to be more proactive in \\nensuring our Nation's cybersecurity before there are additional serious \\nbreaches. This legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by \\nencouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their \\ninvestors and customers on whether and how their boards of directors \\nand senior management are prioritizing cybersecurity.\\n  I thank the bill's supporters, including the North American \\nSecurities Administrators Association, the Council of Institutional \\nInvestors, the National Association of State Treasurers, the California \\nPublic Employees' Retirement System, the Bipartisan Policy Center, MIT \\nProfessor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law Professor Jack Coffee, Harvard \\nLaw Professor John Coates, K&L Gates LLP, and the Consumer Federation \\nof America, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins, Senator \\nWarner, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jones, and me in supporting this \\nlegislation.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Technology', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=610, text=\"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Presidents Day recess, I \\nannounced that I would introduce legislation if the tax extenders \\nweren't included in the legislation that we passed at that time that \\nwould keep government open.\\n  Today I am following through on that promise with a bill that I am \\nintroducing with Finance Committee ranking member Senator Wyden of \\nOregon.\\n  It is fitting that I am taking this step in the same month as \\nGroundhog Day, as the subject of my remarks is something that Congress \\nhas had to deal with too many times already.\\n  Next to me is a depiction from the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' which is \\nabout a man named Phil who must relive the same day over and over until \\nhe gets everything right. While we still need to break the cycle of \\nrepetitive short-term extensions, the right thing to do right now is to \\nextend these already-expired provisions for 2018 and 2019.\\n  As I have said before, the tax extenders are a collection of \\ntemporary tax\\n\\n\\nincentives that have required extension on a very regular basis in \\norder to keep them available to the taxpayers. Currently, there are 26 \\nprovisions. At one time there were as many as 50-some. We have done \\naway with some of them and made some of those laws permanent, but these \\n26 provisions expired at the end of 2017. They need to be extended, as \\nwell as three others that expired at the end of last year.\\n  Today we are in the middle of filing season for 2018 tax returns, and \\ntaxpayers affected by these expired provisions need a resolution so \\nthat they can file. I want to stress that I want to find a long-term \\nresolution so that we don't have to have temporary tax policy, but it \\nis critical we make it clear to the taxpayers that these provisions are \\navailable for the 2018 filing season and extending them for this year \\nwill give us room to take a needed long-term view of this temporary tax \\npolicy.\\n  Many of the tax extenders are intended to be incentives, and to be \\nsuccessful, then, these incentives need to be in effect before \\ndecisions can be made. That is why we should provide extensions for at \\nleast 2 years, to maximize that incentive effect. But it is also \\nimportant that we extend these provisions for 2018, even though the \\nyear has obviously already ended. We have developed a very bad policy \\nand a very bad habit of extending these tax provisions year after year, \\nand people and businesses have come to expect that the extension will \\nhappen.\\n  As a result, decisions were made by various businesses in 2018 based \\nupon the expectation of extension, and that is a reasonable expectation \\nbecause we have done it over decades. In other words, people did what \\nwe wanted them to do in their business decisions when these provisions \\nwere created. We should not retroactively punish these businesspeople \\nfor Congress's inaction.\\n  Today, a diverse group of organizations, including the National \\nBiodiesel Board, the American Trucking Associations, and the National \\nCorn Growers Association, among others, sent a letter to congressional \\nleaders requesting that the expired provisions be extended through 2019 \\nas quickly as possible. I want to quote a few sentences from that \\nletter:\\n\\n       Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as \\n     it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private \\n     sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we \\n     respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these \\n     expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate \\n     legislative vehicle.\\n\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be \\nprinted in the Record.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=611, text=\"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, another very important point I want to \\nmake has to do with the question about whether an extender package \\nshould be offset or not. Around here, the word ``offset'' means if you \\nhave tax provisions that might lose revenue, then do you have other \\nrevenue coming in to take its place? The House has decided that is what \\nyou should do--pay as you go, or PAYGO, as they might call it. It is a \\nrule of the House.\\n  I have a long record of promoting budget responsibility, and I am as \\nconcerned about the deficit and debt as anyone. However, we also have \\nbipartisan precedent for treating the extension of temporary tax \\npolicy, like these extenders, just as we treat the extension of annual \\nspending policy. In neither case do we need offset for such extensions. \\nIn other words, it is all right to spend more money or continue to \\nspend the same amount of money after a program has expired, and you \\ndon't have to offset it when you have tax law that has been on the \\nbooks for a couple of decades, and it is sunset. Why should you have to \\nsunset that? There are a few people around here who think it is all \\nright to spend money without offsets, but it is wrong to do tax policy \\nunless you have offsets.\\n  There are a few specific items in this legislation that I want to \\ntake time to mention. Significant work has already been done to provide \\nlong-term solutions on two extenders--the short line railroad tax \\ncredit and the biodiesel tax credit.\\n  The bill I am introducing extends those credits at their current \\nlevels for 2018 and 2019. I want my colleagues to\\n\\n\\nknow that I still remain committed to enacting the compromises that \\nseveral of our colleagues and I worked with the stakeholders to \\nachieve.\\n  The bill also includes an extension of a proposal adopted last \\nCongress that would extend the 7.5-percent floor for itemized \\ndeductions of medical expenses. Without this provision, the floor on \\ndeductions will be 10 percent for 2019. This means that without this \\nprovision, individuals with chronic illnesses and high medical expenses \\nwould have to pay more for healthcare before that excess can be \\ndeducted in the expenses on their 2019 tax returns.\\n  This proposal is a very important priority for one of our best \\ncolleagues, Senator Collins. She deserves a lot of credit for getting \\nwhat has turned into a bipartisan proposal to help many Americans \\nfacing catastrophic medical expenses.\\n  Finally, the legislation includes provisions to assist Americans who \\nhave been affected by natural disasters in 2018. This package includes \\nproposals that we have adopted in prior years to help Americans recover \\nfrom natural disasters across our country. For example, the package \\nwould allow increased access to retirement funds and relax restrictions \\naround charitable giving. I am sure everyone here would like to help \\npeople affected by these natural disasters as soon as we are able to.\\n  I don't want my comments today to imply that each tax extender should \\nbe permanently extended, but the right thing to do now is to provide \\nextensions for at least 2018 and 2019. In the long term, Congress needs \\nto decide if these provisions should be allowed to expire or if they \\nshould be phased out or if they should be made permanent as current tax \\npolicy or modified in some way beyond expiring, phasing out, or being \\nmade permanent.\\n  Those decisions need to be made after we resolve the short-term \\ncrisis caused by the current lapse. These provisions have support of \\nMembers on both sides of the aisle. For people who think that things \\naround here get done only with Republicans fighting Democrats or vice \\nversa, these provisions have wide bipartisan support.\\n  There is a solid foundation for a long-term package consisting of \\nmany of these provisions in one form or another. We need to get past \\ntoday so that we can chart the course for a reliable future for the tax \\nextenders and give business some certainty.\\n  Just as Phil wants to stop living the same day over and over again, I \\nthink all of us want to break the cycle of short-term extensions of, in \\nmany cases, very popular tax policy. The legislation I introduce today \\nwith the ranking member, Senator Wyden of Oregon, is a critical first \\nstep toward helping taxpayers complete their 2018 returns and helping \\nus begin work on a long-term solution to temporary tax policy.\\n  I have asked our majority leader to rule XIV this bill onto the \\ncalendar, and I urge the House to send us a tax bill to address the \\nextenders without further delay.\\n  Just this morning, I had discussions with Iowa Congressmen of both \\npolitical parties about this issue to contact the leadership of the \\nHouse and the leadership of the Ways and Means Committee on the \\nimportance of moving legislation since the Constitution doesn't allow \\nthe Senate to move tax legislation in the first place.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=612, text=\"  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, during the debate on the nomination of \\nAndrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection \\nAgency I came to the floor to express concerns on a number of issues, \\nincluding EPA's regulation of per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl \\nsubstances--PFAS.\\n  PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals developed in the 1940s. PFAS \\ncan be found across industries in many products, including food \\npackaging, nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam \\nused by the military. These chemicals have a long and tragic history--\\nsuffice it to say that their widespread use resulted too many Americans \\nwithout access to safe drinking water.\\n  This very issue is a matter of some controversy as EPA has failed to \\nprovide meaningful and swift action on these chemicals under this \\nadministration. That is why I am here today to introduce a bipartisan \\nbill to designate PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the \\nFederal superfund law. The Carper-Capito-Peters-Tillis-Stabenow-Rubio-\\nMerkley-Gardner-Reed-Murkowski-Shaheen-Burr-Bennet-Manchin bill will \\nforce EPA to begin the rulemaking process to protecting Americans from \\noverexposure to these harmful chemicals and hold polluters accountable. \\nIt is very similar to legislation that has already been introduced in \\nthe House of Representatives by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.\\n  In his confirmation hearing, Andrew Wheeler said, and I quote:\\n\\n       It is these Americans that President Trump and his \\n     Administration are focused on, Americans without access to \\n     safe drinking water or Americans living on or near hazardous \\n     sites, often unaware of the health risks they and their \\n     families face. Many of these sites have languished for years, \\n     even decades. How can these Americans prosper if they cannot \\n     live, learn, or work in healthy environments? The answer is \\n     simple. They cannot. President Trump understands this and \\n     that is why he is focused on putting Americans first.\\n\\n  One would think those words might mean that there could be some \\ncommon ground at least on addressing PFAS. After all, who wouldn't \\nagree that we should be acting with urgency to address contamination \\nfrom these hazardous chemicals?\\n  According to one 2017 study, drinking water supplies for 6 million \\nU.S. residents have exceeded the EPA's lifetime health advisory for \\nthese chemicals.\\n  Another 2018 study performed by the Environmental Working Group \\nreports that up to 110 million Americans could have PFAS-contaminated \\nwater.\\n  In 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was assessing \\nthe risk of groundwater contamination from firefighting foam at dozens \\nof fire and crash testing sites across the country. It is likely that \\nthey are all contaminated.\\n  Just last year, the town of Blades in my home State of Delaware \\nalerted its 1,250 residents, as well as businesses and schools that use \\npublic water, to stop using public water for drinking an cooking \\nbecause PFAS chemicals were present at nearly twice the Federal health \\nadvisory level. Reportedly, 36 of 67 sampled groundwater wells on Dover \\nAir Force Base showed dangerously high levels of PFOA and PFOS. And it \\nis not just Delaware--contamination is widespread, in red States and \\nblue States, in small water systems and large ones, on military sites \\nand in residential areas, from Maine to Alaska.\\n  It is essential that we legislate to require EPA to designate PFOA \\nand PFOS as ``hazardous substances,'' which means that polluters could \\nbe held responsible for cleaning it up under the superfund law. In its \\nrecently released PFAS Action Plan, EPA has said again that it would \\nissue this proposal in the future but did not indicate how long it will \\ntake to complete. Unfortunately, it has no sense of urgency to address \\nthese emerging contaminants and to protect American's from harmful \\nlevels of contamination.\\n  EPA had an opportunity to take action to address PFAS chemicals in a \\nreal and comprehensive way; however, time and again, it has failed to \\nmove in an expeditious and meaningful way. That is why this bill is so \\nimportant. Designating these chemicals as hazardous substances will, at \\na minimum, start the process to getting these contaminated sites \\ncleaned up. This not the silver bullet to the broader contamination \\nproblems, but it is a start.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=613, text=\"  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am joined this morning by a group of my \\nDemocratic colleagues to talk about the greatest threat facing our \\ncountry and our planet--climate change. Despite the gravity and scale \\nof the problem, at no time in the past 5 years have Republicans brought \\neven a single bill to the floor to meaningfully address climate change. \\nThey brought CRAs to the floor to repeal critical environmental \\nprotections that limited the emission of greenhouse gases like methane. \\nThey brought legislation to open up more Federal lands to oil drilling, \\nbut they haven't brought forward a single meaningful bill to address \\nclimate change.\\n  Ironically, the first bill Leader McConnell would bring to the floor \\non climate change is a bill that he and his party intend to vote \\nagainst. What a ridiculous sham; what a pathetic political stunt. It \\nwould be a stunt on its own from a leader who just a month ago claimed \\nhe didn't bring sham bills to the floor, but it is an even greater \\nstunt because they have nothing positive to say about dealing with this \\nclimate crisis.\\n  So today, Democrats will be introducing a resolution to steer the \\ndirection of this conversation about climate change back in the right \\ndirection--all 47 Democrats, every single one.\\n  We are introducing a resolution that affirms three simple things: \\nFirst, climate change is real; second, climate change is changed by \\nhuman activity; and third, Congress must act immediately to address \\nthis problem. These are three simple things--three things that the vast \\nmajority of the American people agree with. Two are plain facts, and \\nthe third is just a statement that Congress should take action in light \\nof those two facts.\\n  Our resolution does not prescribe what action we should take. It \\ndoesn't say that someone has to be for this solution or that solution. \\nIt simply states that climate change is happening, and we ought to do \\nsomething about it. It is like saying that opioid abuse is a problem, \\nand we should do something. Surely every Senator agrees with that.\\n  In an ideal world, every single Republican Senator would sign on to \\nour climate change resolution because there should be nothing \\ncontroversial about it at all. But because one political party in \\nAmerica largely denies the science or, as I am sure my colleague from \\nRhode Island will address, is so in the pocket of Big Oil that it \\nrefuses to admit the severity of it, I suspect many of our Republican \\ncolleagues will not sign on, and what a shame--what a shame--that would \\nbe. At least the American people will know which of their Senators \\ndenies the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community.\\n  So if and when Leader McConnell moves to proceed to the Green New \\nDeal, Democrats will demand a vote on our resolution, and we will see \\nif Leader McConnell is so eager to take that vote.\\n  Again, I have asked him every day; I asked him earlier this morning: \\nLeader McConnell, do you believe climate change is real? Leader \\nMcConnell, do you believe it is caused by human activity? And, Leader \\nMcConnell, do you believe Congress has to act to deal with climate \\nchange? We have simply heard silence from the leader and from just \\nabout every other Republican so far.\\n  So we are going to push this resolution, and we hope the American \\npeople will let their Senators who are not on this resolution know that \\nthey should be on it. It is the first step to moving something in a \\npositive direction because we intend to go on offense on climate.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

The \\nFounders gave this power to the legislative body, not the executive, to \\nensure there is a broad support for how public funds are spent.\\n  Consequential and far-reaching decisions about spending taxpayer \\nmoney are not left to one person, not even the President.\\n  This body has rejected the President's request to give him $5.7 \\nbillion for his wall along the southern border with Mexico. On February \\n14, not 2 weeks ago, we passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \\n2019 by a vote of 83 to 16. That compromise bill did not include the \\n$5.7 billion the President wanted to build his wall.\\n  Whether you believe Congress should fund the President's wall is not \\nat issue. This is a question about the strength of the rule of law in \\nthis country and about the separation of powers, which forms the \\nfoundation of our American government.\\n  The President's declaration of a national emergency is an end-run \\naround Congress's power to appropriate--plain and simple. To quote \\nSenator Collins, the President is ``usurping congressional authority.''\\n  We are the representatives of the people. The people do not want to \\nspend $5.7 billion on the President's wall, and we must protect their \\nwill.\\n  Let's be clear. This emergency declaration has serious implications \\nfor States all across the country. To build this wall, the White House \\nwill raid $3.6 billion from the Department of Defense's military \\nconstruction budget and $2.5 billion from that Department's drug \\ninterdiction program, but the White House apparently failed to realize \\nthere are only about $80 million in the drug interdiction account. So \\nwe should be prepared for a raid on other accounts or taking even more \\nfrom military construction funding.\\n  These are military construction funds that Congress already has \\nappropriated for specific projects necessary to support the national \\nsecurity priorities of the United States. I am privileged to serve on \\nthe Appropriations Committee. I understand the hard and careful work \\nthat goes into these funding decisions.\\n  From my home State of New Mexico, Congress allocated some $85 million \\nto construct a formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base in the \\nsouth-central part of New Mexico for unmanned aerial vehicles. This \\ninvestment in technology tracks terrorists\\n\\n\\nand protects our national security. We allocated $40 million to the \\nWhite Sands Missile Range to build an information systems facility \\nbadly needed for next-generation research and development activities at \\nthe range. Both of these projects were vetted over several years and \\ndeemed important to our national security.\\n  New Mexico is not alone. Many States' military bases and regional \\neconomies will be impacted. Colorado, for example, is at risk of losing \\nalmost $100 million for construction projects at Fort Carson near \\nColorado Springs. Ohio risks $61 million for the first installment for \\nbuilding at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center at Wright-\\nPatterson Air Force Base.\\n  Military construction projects totaling $210 million are at risk in \\nFlorida, $520 million in Texas, $81 million in Utah, and the list goes \\non and on. Projects in every corner of the country will be impacted.\\n  According to the 1976 Senate report from the National Emergencies \\nAct, the President's emergency power may ``be utilized only when actual \\nemergencies exist.'' As a border Senator, I am here to tell you that \\nthere is no actual national security emergency at our southern border \\nnecessitating a massive wall along the southern border, as this body \\nhas already determined. This is a matter where the President and \\nCongress have disagreed and the President is trying to overrule \\nCongress by fiat.\\n  A bipartisan group of 58 former national security officials are \\nsounding the alarm. They write: ``Under no plausible assessment of the \\nevidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the \\npresident to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a \\nwall at the southern border.''\\n  The evidence speaks for itself. The number of border apprehensions \\nhas decreased dramatically. Since the early 2000s, southern border \\napprehensions have dropped 81 percent. The number of apprehensions at \\nthe end of fiscal year 2017 was the lowest it has been since 1971--a \\n46-year low. We have the lowest number of undocumented immigrants in \\nour country that we have had in over a decade.\\n  The Pew Research Center estimated recently that the total number of \\nundocumented immigrants residing in the United States is far less than \\nsince 2004. That is a 14-year low. And more people emigrate to Mexico \\nfrom the United States than immigrate from Mexico to here. That is \\nright. We have a negative net migration rate with Mexico.\\n  I am one of the four States that border Mexico--one of the four \\nStates that will be the most directly affected by a wall. I know for an \\nabsolute fact that there is no national security emergency along my \\nState's border with Mexico. It is quite the opposite.\\n  New Mexico's border communities are thriving. International commerce \\nis thriving. Our multicultural communities are thriving. Crime rates \\nare low.\\n  A wall like the President wants would be disastrous for a State like \\nNew Mexico. It will seize away private property and carve up family \\nranches, farms, and homesteads. It will harm the beautiful but fragile \\nenvironment there on the border.\\n  Again, whether you support the President's wall is not at issue on \\nthis vote. As Senator Tillis put it in an op-ed in the Washington Post, \\n``I support President Trump's vision on border security. But I would \\nvote against the emergency.''\\n  Another Senate Republican Senator recently said, ``Congress has been \\nceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades. We \\nshould use this moment as an opportunity to start taking power back.''\\n  Over 20 former Republican Senators and Representatives were compelled \\nto pen a letter opposing the emergency declaration. They state: ``It \\nhas always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how \\nstrong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to \\npresidents and party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional \\nrepublic we must act within the borders of the Constitution.''\\n  The time to act is now. Litigation has been filed, but Congress \\nshould resolve the issue of our own constitutional authority and not \\nwait for the courts.\\n  Let me repeat. The vote we will take will be historic. It is \\nimperative that all of us--Republican and Democrat--protect and defend \\nour Constitution and that we protect and defend the checks and balances \\nthat unequivocally place the power of the purse with Congress and that \\nwe affirm our powers--powers that are separate from the President's.\\n  Our oath is to uphold the Constitution, and the Constitution is \\nclear. The Constitution does not empower the President to raid money by \\ndecree just because Congress has already said no.\\n  I will vote to terminate the President's declaration of the national \\nemergency to build his wall, and I will urge everyone in this Chamber \\nto protect our constitutional prerogative and to do so as well.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=615, text=\"  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the resolution \\nthat I am joining Senator Udall in introducing. It would reverse the \\nPresident's ill-advised decision to declare a national emergency and \\ncommandeer funding provided for other purposes by Congress and instead \\nredirect it to construct a wall on our southern border.\\n  I thank Senator Udall for his leadership and also recognize the \\nsupport we have received from our cosponsors, Senator Murkowski and \\nSenator Shaheen.\\n  Let me be clear. The question before us is not whether to support or \\noppose the wall. It is not whether to support or oppose President \\nTrump. Rather, it is this: Do we want the executive branch now or in \\nthe future to hold a power that the Founders deliberately entrusted to \\nCongress?\\n  It has been said that Congress's most precious power is the power of \\nthe purse set out in plain language in article I, section 9 of our \\nConstitution. It reads as follows: ``No money shall be drawn from the \\nTreasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law.''\\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 72, made clear the Founders' view \\nthat only the legislative branch commands this power, not the judiciary \\nand not the executive. James Madison, in Federalist 58, called the \\npower of the purse ``the most complete and effectual weapon with which \\nany constitution can arm the [ . . . ] representatives of the people.''\\n  Congress's power was jealously guarded in the early days of our \\nRepublic. No less an authority on our constitutional framework than \\nSupreme Court Justice Joseph Story, in his famous ``Commentaries,'' \\nexplained that ``[i]f it were otherwise, the executive would possess an \\nunbounded power over the public purse of the nation, and might apply \\nall its monied resources at his pleasure.''\\n  Throughout our history, the courts have consistently held that ``only \\nCongress is empowered by the Constitution to adopt laws directing \\nmonies to be spent from the U.S. treasury.''\\n  I strongly support protecting the institutional prerogatives of the \\nU.S. Senate and the system of checks and balances that is central to \\nthe structure of our government.\\n  I support funding for better border security, including physical \\nbarriers where they make sense. I understand the President is \\ndisappointed that the funding he requested did not pass, but the \\nfailure of Congress to pass funding in the amount the President prefers \\ncannot become an excuse for the President to usurp the powers of the \\nlegislative branch.\\n  This is not the first time I have made this argument against \\nExecutive overreach. In 2015, I authored the Immigration Rule of Law \\nAct, legislation that would have provided a statutory basis for the \\nDreamer population, while rolling back President Obama's 2014 Executive \\norders expanding that program.\\n  As I explained at the time, even though I supported comprehensive \\nimmigration reform and was disappointed that it had not passed, I \\nrejected the notion that its failure could serve as the justification \\nfor President Obama to implement by Executive fiat that which Congress \\nhad refused to pass, regardless of the wisdom of Congress's decision.\\n  I would now like to turn to a discussion of the National Emergencies \\nAct. This act was passed in 1976 to standardize the process by which \\nthe President can invoke national emergency powers and Congress can \\nterminate the declaration through a joint resolution such as the one we \\nare introducing today.\\n\\n\\n  The act is procedural in nature. It lays out the process the \\nPresident must follow to declare a national emergency but does not \\nprovide the President with any additional powers. Instead, it requires \\nthe President to specify where, in existing law, he has been granted \\nthe authority for the powers he intends to exercise.\\n  By itself, the National Emergencies Act does not give the President \\nthe power to repurpose billions of dollars to build a wall. The \\nPresident must look elsewhere for that authority.\\n  In his declaration, the President cites the authority provided by \\ntitle 10, section 2808 of the U.S. Code, which relates to \\n``Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or \\nnational emergency.'' But that authorization applies only to ``military \\nconstruction projects'' that are ``necessary to support [the] use of \\nthe armed forces.'' I do not believe this provision can be fairly read \\nto bootstrap the presence of troops along the southern border into the \\nauthority to build a wall as a military construction project.\\n  The question isn't whether the President can act in an emergency but \\nwhether he can do so in a manner that would undermine the congressional \\npower of the purse.\\n  Here, I think we need a better understanding of what should qualify \\nas an emergency. One place we could turn is to a five-part test \\noriginally developed by the Office of Management and Budget in 1991, \\nunder former President George Herbert Walker Bush, to determine whether \\nrequested funding merited an ``emergency spending'' designation under \\nour budget rules.\\n  Under that test, a spending request was designated as an \\n``emergency'' only if all five of the following conditions were met:\\n  First, expenditures had to be necessary; second, the need had to be \\nsudden, coming into being quickly, not building up over time; third, \\nthe need had to be urgent; fourth, the need had to be unforeseen; and \\nfifth, the need could not be permanent.\\n  I raise this test only by way of analogy, but it is fair to say that \\nwhether or not you agree with the President that more should be done to \\nsecure the southern border--and I do agree with the President's goal--\\nhis decision to fund a border wall through a national emergency \\ndeclaration would not pass this five-part test.\\n  The President's declaration also has practical implications for the \\nmilitary construction appropriations process, as my colleague has \\npointed out.\\n  Last year, in testimony before the Appropriations Committee, the \\nDepartment of Defense said that the President's budget request for \\nmilitary construction funding was crucial to support our national \\ndefense, including construction projects to improve military readiness \\nand increase the lethality of the force. This includes missile defense, \\nimproved facilities in Europe to deter Russian aggression, and \\ninfrastructure to operationalize the F-35 stealth fighter.\\n  This also included several important efforts at the Portsmouth Naval \\nShipyard in Maine that are vital to the Navy conducting timely \\nmaintenance and refueling of our Nation's submarines. Shifting funding \\naway from these vital projects is shortsighted and could have very real \\nnational security implications.\\n  We must defend Congress's institutional powers, as the Founders hoped \\nwe would, even when doing so is inconvenient or goes against the \\noutcome we might prefer.\\n  The gridlock we have experienced on difficult issues like border \\nsecurity and immigration reform is not simply a failure to get our work \\ndone but a reflection of the fact that we have yet to reach a \\nconsensus.\\n  The President's emergency declaration is ill-advised precisely \\nbecause it attempts to shortcut the process of checks and balances by \\nusurping Congress's authority. This resolution blocks that overreach, \\nand I hope, regardless of our colleague's position on the construction \\nof the border wall, that we will join together to assert Congress's \\nconstitutional authority in the appropriations process.\\n  I urge our colleagues to support this important resolution.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",

Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the \\nextraordinary life of Ms. Bettie Mae Fikes, the ''Voice of Selma.''\\n  At the age of 16, Ms. Fikes was one of the singers of the Civil \\nRights Movement and a member of the Students Nonviolent Coordinating \\nCommittee (SNCC), which was the only national civil rights organization \\nled by young people during the Movement. Ms. Fikes bravely led marches \\nwith songs, registered voters, boycotted buses, sat in at lunch-\\ncounters and led walkouts at R.B. Hudson High School to support the \\ndesegregation of the school.\\n  From an early age, Ms. Fikes began singing with her parents, both of \\nwhom were from families of gospel singers and preachers. Ms. Fikes was \\nexposed to classic hymns and songs and was encouraged to use her voice \\nto sing with her parents. At the tender age of four, Ms. Fikes had her \\nfirst big performance: her first church solo. With that success, she \\nbegan to travel throughout the country with her parents' groups, the SB \\nGospel Singers and the Pilgrim Four. However, when Ms. Fikes's mother \\npassed away when she was 10 years old, she moved around from Michigan, \\nCalifornia, and finally to Selma, Alabama.\\n  Ms. Fikes continued to be involved in singing in the church when she \\nmoved to Selma. She used every opportunity she could to let her voice \\nbe heard. It is no surprise, given her background that she proved to be \\nan emerging music leader when she joined SNCC at age 16. The more she \\nbecame involved with SNCC, the more it became apparent that she would \\ngo to jail.\\n  The foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement prepared themselves \\nfor the eventuality that they would be arrested. If an officer \\nannounced that they were under arrest, they knew to fall to their knees \\nand to force the officers to carry them to the bus. However, when the \\ntime came, Ms. Fikes and her friend Evelyn Manns realized the police \\nwere using cattle prods on the young men and women. Hoping to avoid \\nthis pain, both women stood up and loaded the bus to go to jail.\\n  Ms. Fikes bounced between the county and city jail, Camp Selma and \\nCamp Camden. She was brought before Judge Reynolds where she was \\nrepeatedly asked who organized the march. Judge Reynolds and others \\nhoped that the students would implicate Martin Luther King, Jr. in \\nhopes of building a case against Dr. King for contributing to the \\ndelinquency of minors. Instead, Ms. Fikes loudly declared: ``Jesus lead \\nme, and my mama feed me.'' This frustrated the judge and led to Ms. \\nFikes being jailed for nearly three weeks.\\n  Instead of being defeated, Ms. Fikes used this time to organize other \\nyoung people who were also sent to jail.\\n  ``I had been there so long I felt like a trustee there,'' she once \\nsaid. With this new Trustee status and the assistance of Reverend F.D. \\nReese of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in Selma, Ms. Fikes was \\nable to help others.\\n  Ms. Fikes also bore witness to Bloody Sunday. That morning Ms. Fikes \\nwas a messenger, carrying messages from Brown Chapel AME to the head of \\nthe line at the base of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. She described the \\nexperience later, saying, ''You know how it feels just before a storm--\\nthere was nobody walking on the streets . . . it was such a stillness \\nthat you can't explain.''\\n  As tensions rose, Ms. Fikes continued delivering messages back and \\nforth, when, finally, a half block from the church, she heard the \\nrumbling of Bloody Sunday: ``Out of this stillness, this earthquake \\n[sound], the ground it just shifted . . . and when I looked up . . . \\npeople were running everywhere.'' Despite the hate and the violence, \\nMs. Fikes saw the true spirit of the foot soldiers of Selma.\\n  After her time in Selma, Ms. Fikes went on to become a very \\nsuccessful singer who has\\n\\n\\ngraced the stages of Carnegie Hall and the Library of Congress, as well \\nas the 2004 Democratic National Convention where she was introduced by \\nMaya Angelou. She has had the opportunity to perform with Joe Turner, \\nLightnin' Hopkins, Albert King, James Brown, Bob Dylan, and Mavis \\nStaples, among others.

After becoming a single mother of \\nfour children, Mrs. Corbett set out to improve her economic outlook by \\nreturning to school to earn her high school diploma and an associate's \\ndegree from Wilson Community Technical Institute.\\n  Mrs. Corbett's influence in Wilson was transformational. In 1968, \\nMrs. Corbett became one of the key founders of the Wilson Community \\nImprovement Association (WCIA). Mrs. Corbett led WCIA's growth from a \\nlocal grassroots organization to a proactive movement that was a model \\nfor community development corporations across the country. Mrs. \\nCorbett's indelible contributions to Wilson include coordinating voter \\nregistration drives across East Wilson and engaging the youth in \\neducational and recreational programs. In 1973, under Mrs. Corbett's \\nleadership, WCIA established the Wilson Senior Citizen Center, which \\nwas the first nutritional feeding program in Wilson County.\\n  While championing the value of homeownership, Mrs. Corbett advocated \\nfor programs that would make owning a home an attainable goal even to \\nthose with modest means. In 1991, WCIA received a $1.2 million grant \\nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build 68 \\nhomes for low- and moderate-income people. Over 200 families applied \\nfor residency in the subdivision, Adventura East. After purchasing more \\nland, WCIA completed an additional 30 units. Today, the Adventura East \\nI & II subdivision is home to 148 families. In 1993, with WCIA's \\naffordable housing momentum building, the organization acquired Sunset \\nTerrace, a 104-unit housing complex. Two years later, WCIA\\n\\n\\nsuccessfully purchased and restored Beacon Pointe Apartments in Wilson. \\nIn 1997, WCIA restored and renovated Mercy Hospital, which was built in \\n1913 as one of three African American hospitals in North Carolina.\\n  Mrs. Corbett's service to her community has received national and \\ninternational recognition and awards, including the prestigious Nancy \\nSusan Reynolds award, the Citizen Award for Outstanding Service to \\nCitizens of Wilson, and the Pioneering Award for Exemplary Service in \\nCommunity Economic Development. Mrs. Corbett has also been featured in \\nseveral publications and books, including ``To Right These Wrongs'' and \\n``Greater Freedom.''\\n  Mrs. Corbett leaves to cherish her memory, four children, Barbara \\nClaudette Blackston of Wilson, North Carolina; Christopher Evans of \\nApex, North Carolina; Donald Ray Evans of Portsmouth, Virginia; and \\nAlvin Quintin Corbett of Eastampton, New Jersey; and a host of \\nrelatives, friends, and loved ones.\\n  Madam Speaker, as a devoted mother, friend, and public servant, Mrs. \\nFannie Mae Evans Corbett's passing will surely be felt by all whose \\nlives she touched. She will forever be missed, but never forgotten in \\nthe City of Wilson and across the State of North Carolina.\\n\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=654, text=\"  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I do appreciate the Speaker's new policy \\nthat says a Member of Congress can only have one Special Order in which \\nthey are in charge of the time each week once a week. I have been \\ntrying to get Republicans to take our time, much in the way my \\ncolleague, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the group they call the ``30 \\nSomethings'' did in 2005 and 2006.\\n  I have not had a great deal of success in getting a lot of people to \\ntake Special Order time. But with this new rule and some of the \\nterrific freshmen that we have got who have come in--some of the folks \\nwho have been here a term or two--they are stepping up and taking our \\ntime to discuss critically important issues for our country. Today, I \\nam it from our party, and I am honored to be here.\\n  We have heard a lot of talk, and the reason we say have heard a lot \\nof talk is because there is truth in seeing a double standard at the \\nDepartment of Justice for a number of years now.\\n  There was a time when it was the Department of Justice that Jeff \\nSessions remembered back in the 1980s during his time as U.S. attorney. \\nThat time changed with top people in the FBI and top people in the DOJ; \\nit became no longer about justice, but just us and what we want at the \\nDOJ and the FBI.\\n  In talking to former Justice attorneys, prosecutors, one dear friend \\nin Texas--not in my district, but a very dear friend--we were talking \\nabout how the things that were done by people, including Rosenstein, \\nthe former U.S.\\n\\n\\nattorney, McCabe, Strzok, Page, all of these other people, Ohr, were \\nincredible, just incredible, and I would include Mueller in that.\\n  Mueller as FBI Director, I continue to believe did more damage to the \\nFBI during his 12 years as the director of the FBI than anyone, even \\nthe problems that J. Edgar Hoover created, especially in his later \\nyears, the wiretapping that he did of people who should not have been \\nwiretapped. Of course, he didn't just do it on his own. As I recall, \\nAttorney General Kennedy had supported wiretapping of Martin Luther \\nKing, Jr., if I remember correctly.\\n  But what we have seen in the unmasking of American citizens who have \\nbeen followed by email, by wire--not taps, but just following their \\nconversations as the NSA and our intelligence community is able to do \\nthese days, is absolutely incredible. Hundreds and hundreds of \\nAmericans were unmasked. We were assured with the PATRIOT Act when it \\nwas up for being reauthorized, oh, no, we are so careful to make sure \\nthat we don't capture Americans that should not be captured unless they \\nare involved with a terrorist organization or a known foreign \\nterrorist. They don't get picked up.\\n  But now, if they are talking to a terrorist, a known foreign agent, \\nthen it is possible they could be picked up, but those names are \\nmasked. They are never unmasked. That is too big of a burden. And then \\nwe find out under the Obama administration, the American people have \\nhad their privacy violated, like Democrats and Republicans alike swore \\nto us would not happen. Well, it has happened. And it has continued to \\ngo on.\\n  I had hoped that Christopher Wray would clean things up at the FBI, \\nbut he appears to be more concerned about covering up problems rather \\nthan cleaning up the problems. I saw a good example of that at the end \\nof August when, once again, the intelligence community had made clear \\nthey sent their investigator, Frank Rucker, over to explain to Peter \\nStrzok, as head of the FBI's counterintelligence--and also Dean \\nChappell, their liaison--to explain that we now have 100 percent proof, \\nthere is no question, Hillary Clinton's private email server was \\nhacked.\\n  They embedded a direction into her server that forced every email \\ncoming in and going out into what has now been disclosed publicly by \\nothers as a Chinese intelligence agency front.\\n  They were getting every one of Hillary Clinton's--over 30,000 emails \\nto and from. There were four that were glitches, but otherwise, over \\n30,000 emails. So that must include the ones that President Obama sent \\nusing another name so people wouldn't realize it was him using a \\nprivate server.\\n  But there were also the President's daily intelligence briefings that \\nwent through her home. She had somebody at the home print them out for \\nher without any security clearance. There were all kinds of violations, \\nwhat appeared from the code to be outright crimes, but the double \\nstandard appears to continue.\\n  This is from February 25, an article from CNS News, Terence Jeffrey \\nreported that the inspector general says, ``Prosecution Was Declined \\nfor Senior DOJ Official Who Sexually Assaulted a Subordinate.''\\n  And it goes on to talk about that. The name is not disclosed. He \\nsexually harassed subordinates, sexually assaulted yet another \\nsubordinate, and then lacked candor. That is the DOJ's explanation for \\npeople they don't want to prosecute when they are actually saying that \\nhe lied, committed a crime, but lied when the IG investigated this \\nmatter.\\n  So the unnamed prosecutor or prosecutors were not disclosed, but \\nallowed to retire, no consequences, though guilty of sexual assault in \\nthe DOJ.\\n  Now, there were a lot of things I disagreed on with a late, former \\nFederal judge in Texas named William Wayne Justice, but one thing I \\nagreed with him on, and I heard him tell people: ``You, of all people, \\nespecially, knew better.''\\n  And he would come down harder on somebody like this who had been part \\nof the DOJ. I would imagine Judge Justice, if he were around, he would \\nthrow the book at somebody who worked at Justice and still committed \\ncrime and abused the system. I can just hear him still today coming \\nafter somebody like that.\\n  But not in the DOJ. We have got lots of carryover from the Obama \\nyears, and I know my friend, Jeff Sessions, called them career people \\nbecause they were in career slots. But he was talking about people who \\nloved Sally Yates, thought she did the right thing in refusing to \\ndefend constitutional positions taken by the Trump administration.\\n  Yet, many of those people are still there undercutting President \\nTrump, undercutting Matt Whitaker when he was acting, and will, no \\ndoubt, be undercutting Attorney General Barr.\\n\\n\\n  So this is a real problem when the Justice Department, the one we \\ncounted on for many decades now, if there was something wrong, whether \\nit is civil rights or others, and justice could not be found, the \\nDepartment of Justice could be counted on to come in and pursue real \\njustice, to their credit.\\n  FBI agents and prosecutors, some retired now from the Department of \\nJustice, have privately conveyed to me their broken hearts over the \\ndamage done to the Department of Justice and to the FBI because they \\nbecame so calloused, so self-absorbed, and so political that they have \\ndamaged not only the FBI and not only the Department of Justice, but \\nthis country.\\n  But when you have willing allies in the alt-left media--or some call \\nthem the mainstream media; certainly, alt-left these days--it is \\nunderstandable that same feeling of desperation is felt by the American \\npeople: Where do we turn when the Justice Department is not honest?\\n  It used to be you could trust the media. You could find somebody who \\nwould do such great investigative journalism that they would get to the \\nheart of it and bring something to the forefront, to the point that the \\nAmerican people would justifiably become outraged, and that would force \\neither elected or appointed Federal officials with the Federal \\nGovernment to do something.\\n  But here we have alt-left, lamestream media saying that there is no \\ncrisis on our border. Yet if you look at the same things said by Obama \\nofficials about the same problems, except now exacerbated on our border \\nwith all the caravans that have come, are coming, and are continuing to \\nbe established in Central America, it is amazing how some of these \\nmedia outlets can even continue to call themselves journalists.\\n  An article from Brian Flood, January 10, this year, points out that: \\n``News outlets readily described a `crisis' at the border under then-\\nPresident Barack Obama when he sought funding to deal with a surge of \\nmigrants, many of them women and children. But now that President Trump \\nis in the White House, the mainstream media seem far more reluctant to \\nuse the word.\\n  ``Back in the summer of 2014, the headlines and stories referring to \\nthe C-word''--apparently the crisis word--``were plentiful as the \\nborder surge was taken seriously along the Acela corridor.\\n  ``The Washington Post''--now an alt-left medium--``wrote in 2014, \\n`White House requests $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border \\ncrisis' ''--there is that C-word, crisis--``while CNN published a \\nfeature, `Daniel's journey: How thousands of children are creating a \\ncrisis in America.' It described a problem of `epic proportions.' ''\\n  Now, they point out that: ``Around the same time, the Huffington Post \\ndeclared that `photos of the humanitarian crisis' ''--even Huffington \\ncalled it a crisis--``along the southern border were `shocking,' and \\nABC News reported that Obama requested `$3.7 billion to cope with the \\nhumanitarian crisis on the border and the spike in illegal crossings by \\nunaccompanied minors from Central America.' ''\\n  The ABC News story even mentioned this word to deal with plans for \\n$3.7 billion. This was ABC's headline: ``Immigration crisis funds.'' \\nIncredible.\\n  NBC, June 2014, Andrea Mitchell said the undocumented children \\nflooding the border were, in her words, ``creating a crisis'' for \\nauthorities.\\n  How these news outlets can turn around and now say that there is no \\ncrisis when the testimony and the evidence is clear that the overall \\nnumbers for last year may have been down, but\\n\\n\\nas the testimony and evidence makes clear, in October, November, \\nDecember, and January, those numbers spiked to numbers that our Border \\nPatrol has not dealt with before for minors and family units.\\n  Why would they all of a sudden spike during that time? Because it \\nappeared the Democrats had a chance of taking the majority here in the \\nHouse, and in so doing, Democrats have made clear they wanted to \\ncontinue to allow illegal immigration. They welcomed the families. \\nNaturally, you were going to see a spike.\\n  These people below our southern border in Mexico, Central America, \\nSouth America, and now coming from the Middle East and other \\ncontinents, have been coming for some time from other countries. They \\nare being lured in.\\n  The head of the Border Patrol testified this week in our committee \\nthat they were being pulled in. But really, it is being lured. They \\nhear: Gee, if we will just come now, we have people who are in charge \\nof the House of Representatives who want us there, and they are going \\nto try to stop the President from enforcing and securing the border, so \\nnow is the time to come.\\n  And they are coming. We heard the testimony that about 80 percent of \\nthe people who came across our borders in decades past were normally \\nmale adults. It made sense. Usually, it was people who were coming \\nlooking for work, and they were going to send money to their families \\nback in Mexico. But the word got out the end of last year and this year \\nthat if you will come and bring a minor child, whether it is your child \\nor not, then you have a good chance of staying in the country.\\n  We know that nobody crosses our border illegally on the south unless \\nthey have gotten permission by paying the drug cartels. Over and over \\nduring the nights I have spent on the border, the question has been \\nasked: Where did you get the money to pay to come?\\n  Oh, 1,000 here, 1,000 from people in the U.S.\\n  Well, what about the rest of the money you have to pay?\\n  The drug cartels are going to let me work it off when I get where I \\nam going.\\n  They would normally have an address. As I understand it, that is \\noften the address the drug cartel told them where they would need to go \\nget set up and work off what they owed to the drug cartels.\\n  But, Madam Speaker, you shouldn't be surprised when you see headlines \\nlike: Meth lab in major U.S. city busted, run by drug cartels.\\n  As the Department of Homeland Security folks have pointed out to me \\nbefore, the drug cartels call us their logistics. All they have to do \\nis get somebody illegally into the country, and they hand us the \\naddress of somebody supposedly that they know where they can go live, \\nand we handle the shipping for them. We ship them to wherever they want \\nto go. Sometimes, they are detained, but we have shipped millions of \\npeople around, all over the country.\\n\\n  If what they have told the Border Patrol about working off what they \\nowe the drug cartels is true--I haven't seen or heard any reason it \\nwouldn't be--then our Homeland Security Department for a decade or so \\nhas been shipping people to the location where the drug cartels want \\nthem. The drug cartels are making billions and billions of dollars a \\nyear.\\n  When you hear any Mexican or Central American official who says they \\nwant to keep the American border open, you can just pretty well \\nguarantee they are getting money from the drug cartels.\\n  The best thing, the most caring and loving thing, we could do for our \\nneighbors to the south would be to secure our border, put border \\nbarriers where they need it, whether it is a wall, a 30-foot barrier, \\nwhatever. Secure the border and then that will cut off the billions of \\ndollars of American money going to the drug cartels for them to \\nterrorize people in Mexico and people in Central America.\\n  You care about people south of our border. Of course, we can't bring \\nin all those millions who are suffering under drug cartel rule and \\nreign, but we could secure our border and cut off the domestic \\nterrorists called the drug cartels, cut off their funding so they won't \\nbe able to pay people to cut off the heads of police chiefs or mayors \\nwho take a strong stand against the drug cartels and put those heads on \\na pike as an example to anybody who tries to stand up against the \\ncartels.\\n  It used to be that the drug cartels had a deal. It was just kind of a \\npolicy that they are not going to allow any kind of crime or violence \\nto tourists because that is too important for Mexico to have those \\ntourists' money coming in. That has long since gone by the way. \\nTourists are killed and terrorized.\\n  I long for the day when my wife and I can go back to where we \\nhoneymooned in Mexico, back to where we celebrated anniversaries. It \\nwas wonderful. We don't believe we can do that now.\\n  If we secure our border and dry up the money to the drug cartels, \\nthen the money can begin flowing to Mexico for something besides drugs, \\nand we can cut off the fentanyl and the massive amount of drugs that \\npours across our southern border undetected.\\n  I know some people say the majority of drugs are coming through the \\nports of entry. That is where they catch more of it. But as it was \\nexplained to me and   Steve Chabot some years back down in Colombia, \\nwhen they were showing us--we had DEA. The British had people who were \\nhelping. They were doing a great job fighting the FARC's drugs down in \\nColombia under then-President Uribe. They were saying that this guy is \\nfearless. It is hard keeping him alive, but he is amazing. He is \\nfighting the drug cartels down there.\\n  I said, well, so you are saying about two-thirds of the cocaine, the \\ndrugs from Colombia, goes up through the Gulf of Mexico into Mexico, so \\nit can cross our southern border. Another one-third apparently goes up \\nto California, trying to cross the border, it goes into Mexico across \\nour southern border. I mean, if they have boats that will go that far, \\nwhy not just have them pull up to a Texas or California beach that is \\ndeserted?\\n  These Colombian, American, and British drug experts explained that it \\nis because the drug cartels are businesspeople. They have a business \\nmodel. They have a business plan. They play the odds. They know the \\nodds are many times better to get the drugs into America if they don't \\ngo to a port of entry and they don't go to an abandoned beach \\nsomewhere. They bring it into Mexico, have it cross the Mexico-U.S. \\nborder, and they will get most of their drugs in. So that is their \\nbusiness plan.\\n\\n\\n  That is still going on. It was going on during President Bush's \\nadministration, probably back to Clinton and the former Bush and even \\nReagan, to a lesser extent. But it is sure going on in the 21st \\ncentury.\\n  With all the discussion about there not being a crisis when clearly \\nthere has been and is--it is a humanitarian crisis, but it is also a \\ncrisis of U.S. sovereignty.\\n  We cannot have a country that is based on laws if we cannot control \\nour own borders. We will be overwhelmed, as we have been, by more and \\nmore people who do not observe the laws, do not think the laws are \\nimportant. They do not understand. They have not been educated how \\nimportant it is to enforce the law fairly across the board. They don't \\nknow what it is to preserve self-government.\\n  Franklin knew that, Benjamin Franklin, when he said: ``It is a \\nRepublic, madam, if you can keep it.'' He knew. He had studied history, \\nas had our Founders. They knew that the Constitution that came \\ntogether, as Washington referenced, had to have divine providence at \\nwork, because no way these guys who started out for 5 weeks doing \\nnothing but yelling at each other could have come up with a document \\nthat was the best governing document, the best constitution, put \\ntogether in the history of mankind.\\n  Here is more about the media's hypocrisy, an article from the \\nWashington Examiner, Eddie Scarry. This has a quote: ``We now have an \\nactual humanitarian crisis''--there is that C-word again--``on the \\nborder that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our \\nimmigration system once and for all.'' That was a quote from then-\\nPresident Barack Obama in the Rose Garden in 2014.\\n  He went on to say--that is, President Obama--``In recent weeks, we've \\nseen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive\\n\\n\\nat the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and \\ntraffickers.''\\n  That is basically, as the Examiner points out, what President Trump \\nsaid. He said: ``Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally \\nbrought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are \\nused as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.''\\n  This article says: ``The only difference is how the media are \\ncovering it.''\\n  The Washington Post said, 2014--this is The Washington Post's words--\\n``The current crisis on the Southwest border, where authorities have \\napprehended tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American \\nchildren since October''--well, there you are. There is that C-word \\nthey used then and belittle the word being used now.\\n  Anyway, this is an article from The New York Times from 2014 by \\nMichael Shear and Jeremy Peters. They said, talking about the border \\ncrossing into Texas, it is ``an urgent humanitarian situation.''\\n  Their article said, and this is from Senator Marco Rubio: ``Let's \\nremember, this administration''--talking about the Obama \\nadministration--``went around for years saying the border has never \\nbeen more secure than it is now. I think,'' and this is Marco Rubio, \\n``that's been exposed as a fallacy over the last 3 weeks.'' That is \\nbecause people were realizing it was a border crisis during the Obama \\nyears.\\n  Just the fact that it has gone on for years and years does not \\ndiminish the crisis. It actually exacerbates the crisis. When you put \\nthe October, November, December, January numbers, record numbers, of \\npeople coming in claiming to be family units--why? Because they have \\nheard, if they have minor children, then they will be allowed to stay, \\nand they will be allowed to keep the minor children. It is encouraging \\na dark market, a criminal market, in children.\\n  Make sure, if you are coming to America, you have a child in your \\ngroup, because then you claim: Oh, we can't be separated.\\n  As the Director of Border Patrol pointed out this week in testimony \\nunder oath, now the huge majority is people coming who are claiming to \\nbe family units. Most of them are, but we don't know. That is why it is \\nimportant to check.\\n  So this is a time of crisis, and you would hope that major media, \\nwhether it is alt-left or whatever, would be reporting what is \\nhappening in America. It is a humanitarian crisis, as they acknowledged \\nduring President Obama's term. It is even more of a humanitarian crisis \\nnow that there are so many more minor children who are being brought \\nhere.\\n  Once again, for those who bring up the term ``war on women,'' how \\nabout the fact that over a third of the young girls, the young women, \\nwho are brought to our southern border illegally are being sexual \\nassaulted, raped, normally multiple times along the way? Do people not \\ncare what is happening? Wouldn't that be a war on women that some of us \\nwant to stop?\\n  The estimate by doctors who have been treating these people say that \\n17 percent of the young boys coming up and crossing into the U.S. \\nillegally have been sexually molested, assaulted.\\n  Where is the outrage? It ought to be from both sides of the aisle.\\n  These are people whose lives are just being terrorized. When we hear \\nabout, ``Oh, well, people are just caring about their families,'' \\nreally? You would subject your daughter to being one of the third who \\nis sexually raped numerous times while you want to come into America? \\nYou would do that to your daughter?\\n  We ought to be helping Mexico. They are not helping much. They are \\nhelping some. But we ought to be shoring up the border. It is the best \\nthing we can do for Mexico, continue to be the most generous country in \\nthe world, in the history of the world, in allowing people to come into \\nour country legally.\\n  Keep that going. It is good for America. But stop the drug cartels \\nfrom controlling our southern border. It ought to be our authorities \\ncontrolling our border, nobody else.\\n  If that is not enough, here comes what has been called a Green New \\nDeal. Some have accurately called it more of a green socialist \\nmanifesto, a green raw deal.\\n\\n  Rick Manning has a great article this month: ``Everyone is talking \\nabout the Green New Deal and how it would end domestic airline travel, \\nthe internal combustion engine, fossil fuel usage, most electricity \\ngeneration, and even ban cow flatulence. You have groups guessing what \\nthe cost of the Green New Deal would be in terms of dollars on an \\nannual basis. . . . To everyone seeking to normalize this Green New \\nDeal, please just shut up.\\n  ``The Green New Deal is the baring of teeth by the new American \\ncommunist, a new breed unleashed that we have seen in the streets, \\nattacking people attending Trump rallies, screaming at teenagers \\nwearing Make America Great Again hats, shouting down and rioting \\nagainst conservative speakers on college campuses.\\n  ``Here is the truth. Socialism and communism are evil. Putting a \\nshroud of legitimacy and normalcy to the destruction of the American \\nideal is being a Menshevik in a Bolshevik revolution. You cannot \\nmoderate the bloodlust of those who seek to enslave you by trying to \\ncome up with common ground or discuss alternatives to meet their needs. \\nThe revolution demands immediate payment.\\n  ``So let's stop talking about the symptoms which the Green New Deal \\nrepresents and actually begin to dissect the disease that is \\ncollectivism. First, definitionally, the only difference between \\nsocialism and communism is if you voluntarily surrender your freedom \\nand wealth or have it confiscated. Either alternative ultimately comes \\nfrom the coercive power of the gun and are based upon the premise that \\nthose who have attained wealth used ill-gotten means to get it. As a \\nresult, they have no moral authority to keep it from those from whom it \\npresumably was stolen.\\n  ``In socialism and communism, individual rights are not derived from \\nGod and guaranteed by the Constitution. Instead, everything you have \\nand can expect comes from the goodwill of the government. It is no \\nmistake that John Lennon's socialist anthem `Imagine' starts with the \\nfollowing words: `Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No \\nhell below us; above us, only sky. Imagine all the people living for \\ntoday.'\\n  ``In order to achieve a kingdom ruled by man, unfettered by morality \\nor rules, you have to nix a sovereign God from the equation. If there \\nis no God, then all rights are nothing more than those that the \\ngovernment chooses to allow you to have, and the only protections that \\nexist are those which they grant. The only question is who gets to be \\nthe one holding the keys over everyone else's life.''\\n  This is what, on one hand, surprises me about billionaires in America \\nfunding a move toward socialism. Obviously, these are not stupid \\npeople. They can look at the history of socialism, communism. They know \\nthat, whether it is socialists or communists, you have two classes. You \\neliminate the middle class. There is no middle class. You have this \\nsmall group of ruling class, and then you have everybody else, all the \\nmiserables.\\n  I guess they think they get us to socialism and they will be part of \\nthat elite socialist class that rules over everybody else.\\n  I have seen it. The summer I lived in the Soviet Union, when it was \\nthe real Soviet Union, there were some nice things, but it was clear \\nthey didn't have freedom. The government watched, through spies, \\neverything that those people did.\\n  I asked, on one occasion: Why is that lady running off?\\n  Well, she is going to go report me, he said.\\n  Why would she go report you? You are not anything to her.\\n  No. In your country you can get ahead by making money. In my country, \\nhe said, we get ahead by stepping on others. So anybody you can turn in \\nfor anything, anybody that you can step on, it elevates you in our \\nsystem here in the Soviet Union.\\n  He was right. And that is where we are headed with people thinking \\nsocialism is a good way to go.\\n  The bumper sticker is true. The big problem with socialism is you can \\nvote your way into it, but you will have to shoot your way out.\\n  That is what we are seeing play out in Venezuela. They voted \\nthemselves\\n\\n\\ninto it, and now they are having to shoot their way out. Unfortunately \\nfor most of them, they don't have guns, so they are pretty empty-handed \\nin fighting a government that has the guns.\\n\\n\\n  It is a tragic situation. It should be one of the most prosperous \\ncountries in the world. It was until socialism took over. And again, as \\nRick Manning is trying to point out, that is where we are headed.\\n  ``It makes one wonder if Ono,'' he said, ``has given up 100 percent \\nof her songwriter royalties to the song to the government as a show of \\nsolidarity for the dream.\\n  ``And here is what they don't say,'' he says, ``in order for the \\nworld to `live as one' with no possessions, someone is going to have to \\ntake all the stuff and hold it collectively for the common good.\\n  ``In order for there to be stuff to take and most importantly eat in \\nthe future, someone is going to have to do the hard work to produce it. \\nSomeone is going to have to figure out how to produce it, and someone \\nis going to have to get it from where it is produced to where the \\nbrotherhood is living. And then someone is going to have to distribute \\nit, being certain that everyone gets the same amount of gruel.''\\n  And I saw that, too, in the stores back in the Soviet Union. If you \\nwere part of that elite ruling class, they would keep back a really \\nnice pair of shoes, maybe the only pair they got, for the highest \\nranking person that they dealt with.\\n  In the stores, the Soviets would tell me: We never find toilet paper; \\nthey hold it in the back for the ruling class. We never find good, \\nfresh vegetables. They hold that back for the ruling class.\\n  It is really tragic the way people are treated, ultimately, in a \\nsocialist or communist society, or now called progressivist.\\n  So, good article by Brad Polumbo, February 26, How Socialism Destroys \\nPrivate Charity and Hurts the Poor. It is tragic.\\n  Between what we see destroying the rule of law in America, coming \\nacross our southern border illegally, overwhelming our schools--how \\nfair is it? If you really care about children, how fair is it to this \\nbig group of children in school?\\n  And as teachers have pointed out to me: I love my kids.

In \\npursuit of his dream to enter public office, Dean entered Howard \\nUniversity School of Law working part time as a clerk to put himself \\nthrough school.\\n  He earned a bachelor's and master's of law, graduating as the \\nvaledictorian in both degrees. After graduating, Dean returned home to \\nFlorida in 1887, taking a position as a school principal and \\nestablishing a law practice in Key West.\\n  His practice grew so quick that he had to resign from the school \\nwithin a year to care for his clients. As his business grew, so did his \\nstanding in the community. In 1888, just a year after moving to Key \\nWest, he was nominated to serve as a county judge.\\n  This didn't sit well with many White political leaders in Key West \\nwho conspired to have him removed from the bench. They fabricated a \\nstory that Judge Dean illegally married an interracial couple and the \\nGovernor of Florida removed him from office.\\n  As Black History Month comes to a close today, it is important to not \\nshy away from uncomfortable moments in our history.

      "Pandas(Index=669, text=\"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the White House recently unveiled the \\nWomen's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, W-GDP, an \\ninteragency plan to increase women's global labor force participation \\nand advancement in the workplace, improve access of women entrepreneurs \\nto market opportunities, and remove barriers to economic growth for \\nwomen.\\n  I support the initiative, although not based on the erroneous claim \\nof some in the White House that it is the first women's initiative ever \\nlaunched by the United States. On the contrary, I and many other \\nMembers of Congress and previous administrations have supported such \\nefforts for many years. However, there is still a lot of work to be \\ndone, and I hope W-GDP builds on those efforts.\\n  Too many of this administration's actions have fallen far short of \\nthe President's rhetoric or have been the antithesis of what he \\npromised, so while I am ready to do what is necessary to support W-GDP, \\nI worry that this initiative may be part of the same story. From human \\ntrafficking at the southern border, to processing asylum applicants, to \\ncombating HIV/AIDS, this administration purports to be serious about \\naddressing global problems while implementing policies or proposing \\nbudgets that bear no resemblance to effective solutions and in many \\ncases would make the situation worse.\\n  For example, while the objectives of W-GDP are laudable, it is being \\nimplemented by the same White House that sought to cut the budget for \\nthe Department of State and foreign assistance programs by roughly 30 \\npercent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, cuts that would have decimated \\nfunding for programs that address the needs of the world's poorest \\npeople, for water and sanitation, maternal and child health, education \\nand employment opportunities, to stave off poverty and disease that \\ndisproportionately afflict women and girls. In fact, the President's \\nbudget did not include a single dollar for W-GDP.\\n  This administration has also waged war on reproductive health, \\nreportedly directing the omission of reporting on reproductive rights \\nin the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights, and \\none of President Trump's first acts after his inauguration was to \\nreinstate the Global Gag Rule. In fact, egged on by extremists in his \\nadministration, he expanded it to condition funding for every \\nnongovernmental organization, NGO, implementing any health programs for \\nthe United States overseas, even if their programs have nothing to do \\nwith reproductive health. In other words, if an NGO spends millions of \\ndollars in India to combat HIV/AIDS, but spends $1 of its own private \\nfunds--not U.S. taxpayer funds--to provide counseling on abortion, it \\nis ineligible for any U.S. Government funding for either purpose. Such \\na policy would be unlawful in our own country.\\n  So while I support W-GDP, I caution all those who defend women's \\nrights and support economic opportunities for women to not be \\ndistracted by one initiative this administration launched on the backs \\nof the Congress's rejection of President Trump's budget and to call on \\nthe White House to adopt a more consistent, comprehensive approach to \\nsupporting women around the world.\\n  With that in mind, I hope the White House will speak out forcefully \\nand consistently about the institutionalized and systemic persecution \\nand discrimination of women in Saudi Arabia and other countries whose \\nautocratic and corrupt governments this White House has embraced. If \\nthe White House expects to be taken seriously about women's \\nempowerment, it cannot remain silent about governments whose laws and \\npolicies treat women as property and that imprison women's rights \\nactivists.\\n  This is not the only area in which the administration is purporting \\nto support vulnerable populations while its short-sighted policies are \\nhaving the opposite effect.\\n  In a November 30, 2018, op-ed in the Washington Post, Ivanka Trump \\nannounced that the administration had\\n\\n\\ndecided to limit the number of waivers for assistance for countries \\nthat are identified in the State Department's annual Trafficking in \\nPersons Report as failing to meet minimum standards for combating human \\ntrafficking. She also noted the administration's pledge of $45 million \\nto a fund to end modern slavery, funds that, as is true for W-GDP, the \\nPresident did not include in his budget and from an account the White \\nHouse proposed to cut.\\n  I agree with the goal of holding governments accountable for failing \\nto meet minimum standards for preventing trafficking in persons, but \\ninformed people know that cutting funding for health, education, \\nenvironmental conservation, counterterrorism, and governance programs \\ndoes nothing to prevent human trafficking, while it undercuts our \\nability to make progress on other issues of national interest.\\n  Yet that is exactly what the administration has done. By belatedly \\napproaching human trafficking as if nothing else matters and limiting \\nuse of the waiver authority Congress provided, administration officials \\nhave spent months tying themselves in knots over which programs to \\ncontinue and which to suspend. The result is that implementing partners \\nare running out of money, services are not being delivered, and \\nimportant programs are shutting down.\\n  The Trump administration needs to stop governing by sound bite. If \\nthe White House is serious about addressing human trafficking and other \\ncomplex challenges, it should work with Congress to secure the \\nnecessary funding and apply the law in a common sense manner that is \\nconsistent with our national interests.\\n\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Welfare & Poverty', 'Civil Rights', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Education', 'Abortion'})\n",

Church spires \\ndominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until recently, had \\nan ordinance that no building could be constructed higher than 55 feet. \\nIn this city, faith is foundational. It is a source of strength and \\ncommunity that dates back centuries.\\n  However, that faith was rocked in June 2015 when a lone gunman \\npunctuated his participation in a Bible study at Emanuel AME\\n\\n\\nChurch with gunshots fired upon the parishioners who had welcomed him, \\nkilling nine and wounding three others. The shooter targeted this place \\nof worship because of its historic significance to the African-American \\ncommunity. This egregious hate crime shattered the sanctity of the Holy \\nCity, and in response Congress observed a moment of silence and all \\nAmericans offered thoughts and prayers.\\n  While a moment of silence and our thoughts and prayers are \\nappreciated in times of tragedy, they do nothing to solve the \\nunderlying problem. The real tragedy in Charleston is it could have \\nbeen prevented. The gunman acquired the weapon used in the massacre \\nbecause of a fault in the law that is now known as the Charleston \\nLoophole. The gun purchase was subject to a background check; however, \\nwhen a glitch in the system caused the background review to take more \\nthan the three-day limit allowed by law, the gunman was able to \\npurchase the weapon, although it was later found that he was ineligible \\nto purchase a gun. The system failed to stop this gun sale to an \\nineligible purchaser and 4,864 others in 2017.\\n  It has been 25 years since the Brady Bill became law, and there has \\nbeen no significant legislation enacted since to stem gun violence. Yet \\nin 2017, 100 people were killed each day in this country with a \\nfirearm--which touches every district represented in this august body.\\n  A vote in support of the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 \\nextends the time allowed for law enforcement to conduct background \\nchecks. Under this bill, if the background check isn't concluded within \\n10 business days, the purchaser can request an expedited background \\ncheck, which notifies law enforcement of the urgency of the review and \\nstarts an additional 10 business day period for the background check to \\nbe completed. While more than 96 percent of background checks are \\ncompleted within three days--and 90 percent of Americans support \\nbackground checks--this expedited review allows for law enforcement to \\ncomplete the small percentage that may take longer than three days. If \\nat the end of the expedited review the background check is \\ninconclusive, then the purchase may proceed.\\n  Restricting the Charleston Loophole doesn't prohibit law abiding \\ncitizens from purchasing a gun, but it does provide more time, if \\nneeded, for law enforcement to ensure weapons are not sold to those \\nwith criminal convictions or mental illness. This is an important first \\nstep our country should take to protect our citizens and their first \\namendment rights.\\n  In troubling times many of us find solace in the Serenity prayer--\\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; \\ncourage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the \\ndifference.''

So Mr. Nadler is quite right.\\n  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1112 to close the \\nCharleston loophole.\\n  We have heard a lot about what is at stake in terms of constitutional \\nrights as it relates to possession of a firearm. There are other \\nconstitutional rights that are at issue here, and that is the right to \\nlife, liberty, the right to live free of gun violence and death, the \\nright of a grandmother to sit on her porch and enjoy a summer evening \\nfree from the dangers of gun violence, the right of young children to \\nplay in a playground and play safely.\\n  So this legislation is very important because it closes a very \\nsignificant loophole in our law.\\n  Over the last two decades, the Charleston loophole has allowed more \\nthan 60,000 purchases of guns by prohibited individuals.\\n  Let that sink in.\\n  Sixty thousand people who are prohibited from having a gun by law \\nwere allowed to get those guns because of this loophole.\\n  One of those purchasers was a white supremacist who used the gun that \\nhe purchased to kill nine worshippers at the Mother Emanuel Church in \\nSouth Carolina. Even though he had a felony drug charge on his record, \\nthis killer was able to buy a gun because his background check wasn't \\ncompleted in 3 days.\\n  And he isn't the only one, of course. A 2016 GAO report found that, \\nbetween 2006 and 2015, guns were transferred to about 6,700 people with \\ndomestic violence convictions and more than 500 individuals with \\nprohibiting protective orders.\\n  So there are many, many examples where the American people are less \\nsafe because criminals and disqualified people can access a firearm \\nbecause the background check wasn't completed in 3 days. This is a very \\nsimple commonsense solution to that problem.\\n  Our laws will not work if we don't keep guns out of the hands of \\ncriminals, dangerous people, other disqualified purchasers, and this \\nbill does that. This is a commonsense proposal.\\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

for the mass shooting \\nthat took the lives of nine individuals at the Emanuel African \\nMethodist Episcopal Church.\\n  The victims were later referred to as ``The Charleston Nine'' and \\n``The Emanuel Nine''.\\n  Under current law, after a prospective buyer completes the \\nappropriate form, the holder of a Federal Firearms License initiates \\nthe background check by phone or computer.\\n  If a determination is not obtained within three business days then \\nthe transfer may legally be completed by default proceeding and that is \\nhow Dylan Roof obtain the handgun he used to commit the killings, which \\nhe purchased from a retail store in West Columbia, SC.\\n  H.R 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would \\nstrengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or \\ndealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.\\n  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a \\nbackground check on prospective buyers using the National Instant \\nCriminal Background Check System (``NICS'').\\n  Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.\\n  Under H.R. 1112, if the NICS system has not returned an answer to the \\nlicensed firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms \\npurchaser may file a petition with the Attorney General for review.\\n  Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms \\ndealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if \\nit has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer \\nhas no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from \\nobtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.\\n  Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or \\ntransfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days \\nhave passed since the initial background check, thus closing the so-\\ncalled ``Charleston loophole.''\\n  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \\ndemonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks \\nSystem (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to \\n99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within \\n90 seconds.\\n  We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the \\ncountless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue \\nto claim so many innocent lives.\\n  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-\\nstraight year in 2016,

rates--\\nas much as 114 percent higher than other states.\\n  A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found \\nthat for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership

Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman very much, and I \\nthank him for his leadership on a very\\n\\n\\nimportant enhancement to the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, \\nwhich requires the FBI to report on the number of petitions it was not \\nable to make a determination on within the 10-day period.\\n  I think Mr. Schneider knows that why we are here on the floor is to \\nsave lives, to be able to protect innocent people from being subjected \\nto what the Emanuel Nine were: worshippers in a church with their \\npastor, praying, as this country allows one to do.\\n  It is my belief that the Schneider-Jackson Lee amendment should be \\npassed, because with this critical data and compliance reporting we can \\nlearn more about legislative injustices like the one that enabled \\nDylann Roof to process a handgun used to murder the nine innocent \\npersons at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and \\nto remind everybody he had not been approved by the NICS reporting \\nsystem, and he was able to come back. This system allows us to know how \\nmany have not been approved, to be able to address the question, to \\nhave better policies dealing with protecting gun violence.\\n  It is my privilege to join my colleague in supporting the Schneider-\\nJackson Lee amendment.\\n  Madam Chair, I close by saying that this tracks the Accidental \\nFirearms Transfer Reporting Act that I introduced in previous \\nCongresses in H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57.\\n  I look forward to working with my colleague as we expand reasonable \\ngun safety legislation to protect our children, our families, and \\nAmericans.\\n  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment which I am \\nproud to cosponsor with the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Brad \\nSchneider.\\n  I thank the Rules Committee for making the Schneider/Jackson Lee \\nAmendment in order and thank the Majority Whip for introducing the \\nunderlying legislation, H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act \\nof 2019.''\\n  H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would \\nstrengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or \\ndealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.\\n  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a \\nbackground check on prospective buyers using the National Instant \\nCriminal Background Check System (``NICS'').\\n  Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.\\n  If the NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed \\nfirearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may \\nfile a petition with the Attorney General for review.\\n  Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms \\ndealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if \\nit has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer \\nhas no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from \\nobtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.\\n  Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or \\ntransfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days \\nhave passed since the initial background check.\\n  The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment strengthens the bill by requiring \\nthe FBI to report on the number of petitions on which it was not able \\nto make a determination regarding the eligibility of the transferee to \\npossess a firearm within the 10-day period allotted by H.R. 1112.\\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment \\nbecause, with this critical data and compliance reporting, we can learn \\nmore about legislative interstices like the one that enabled Dylan Roof \\nto possess the handgun used to murder 9 innocent persons at Mother \\nEmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the \\nnumerous other cases where a firearm was handed over to an unintended \\nand potentially dangerous recipient.\\n  Making sure that policy makers have the most accurate, reliable, and \\ncurrent data regarding background checks is one of the main reasons I \\nintroduced the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act in the 114th \\nand 115th Congress (H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57 respectively).\\n  Madam Chair, if anything, it is gun violence that is a national \\nemergency, and reducing gun violence should be one of Congress's \\nhighest priorities.\\n  The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment will help to do that.\\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment in \\norder.\\n  Again, I thank Majority Whip Clyburn for introducing the underlying \\nlegislation and Congressman Schneider for his work on this salutary \\namendment.\\n  I urge all Members to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment.\\n\\n                            [Feb. 20, 2018]\\n\\n            List of Mass Shootings Since Columbine Massacre\\n\\n                           (By Zayed Abdalla)\\n\\n       Below is a list of all mass shootings in the United States \\n     which occurred after the Columbine High School Massacre. \\n     Dates and death tolls (excluding the shooter) are included. \\n     Although many other mass shootings have occurred, for the \\n     sake of time and physical space, only shootings involving the \\n     death of five or more people have been included in this \\n     article.\\n       1.

Madam Chairwoman, I am proud to cosponsor the \\nEnhanced Background Checks Act, H.R. 1112, and I am also proud today to \\npresent an amendment that will make sure we can track and learn from \\nthe good that this bill will accomplish once it becomes law.\\n  In 2017, 39,773 Americans died from gun violence. This is a public \\nhealth epidemic.\\n  Under current law, if a background check is not completed within 3 \\nbusiness days, a federally licensed firearm dealer may move forward \\nwith a firearms transfer or sale.\\n  The devastating reality is that many horrific acts of gun violence, \\nincluding the massacre of the Emanuel Methodist Church in Charleston, \\nSouth Carolina, which ended nine lives and left several people wounded, \\ncould have been avoided.\\n  Today, we will vote to close the loophole that allowed for that \\ntragedy by closing what has become known as the Charleston loophole. \\nThe Enhanced Background Checks Act will provide the background check \\nsystem with additional time to make a final determination on a \\npotential firearm purchaser before a licensed dealer can transfer a \\ngun.\\n  We have an obligation to the American people and to the victims of \\nthe shooter at the AME church to pass the bill before us today, and I \\nam proud to be part of this effort to protect our communities from gun \\nviolence.\\n  My amendment to H.R. 1112 will require the Government Accountability \\nOffice to submit a report to Congress 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years \\nfollowing the implementation of this law. These reports will analyze \\nthe extent to which the changes made by this law will prevent firearms \\nfrom being transferred to prohibited persons.\\n  I am proud that this amendment has broad support from all \\nstakeholders that have been involved in making this bill a reality.\\n  We must strive for effective, evidence-based policies that promote \\npublic health and protect our communities. My amendment will cost us \\nnothing, but it will help build the evidence base around the \\neffectiveness of good gun violence prevention policies like this one.\\n  This amendment is all the more important, given the regrettable lack \\nof Federal funding for gun violence research. My amendment will finally \\nhelp us demonstrate with data that gun violence prevention measures \\nlike the one before us today will prevent firearms from ending up in \\nthe hands of people who should not have them.\\n  I came to Washington because the people of southern Macomb and \\nsoutheastern Oakland Counties sent me here on a mission, and that \\nmission includes protecting our communities from senseless gun \\nviolence.\\n  I stand today in solidarity with the courageous people of Michigan's \\nNinth Congressional District's Moms Demand Action and Students Demand \\nAction.\\n  We have a responsibility as Members of Congress and as human beings \\nnot just to talk about the horrors of gun violence, but to do \\neverything in our powers to end it. Today, we will take the critically \\nnecessary step to do just that.\\n  I would like to thank Congressman  Jim Clyburn, Peter King, and Joe \\nCunningham for their leadership to ensure that we close the Charleston \\nloophole.

If adopted, the bill \\nwill immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\\n  My Democratic colleagues are set to pass this bill despite the fact \\nthat the ACLU opposes it.\\n  Let me repeat that. The ACLU opposes H.R. 1112 because it is so \\nsweeping and improperly perpetrates unfounded assumptions that people \\nwith mental disabilities should be considered dangerous and are prone \\nto violence without any meaningful due process.\\n  As most of you know, I am a survivor of domestic violence, and that \\nis why this motion to recommit is so personally important to me. This \\nmotion to recommit, in contrast, is narrowly tailored. It would simply \\nallow victims of domestic violence who go through a NICS check to \\nreceive their firearms in 3 days, which is the status quo, if NICS has \\nnot responded with a denial or approval in 3 business days--again, the \\nstatus quo.\\n  Do we really want to tell victims of domestic violence they have to \\nwait up to 20 business days, which is under this bill, before they are \\nallowed to adequately defend themselves?\\n  Do we really want to tell them: Sorry. I know you are purchasing a \\nfirearm to protect yourself, but you have to wait 20 business days?\\n  Should we tell them: Hopefully you can hide from your abuser for the \\nnext month?\\n  The Judiciary Committee recently heard testimony from a young woman \\nwho was raped on her college campus. She did not have a gun on campus \\nbecause the State did not allow her to carry a gun in order to defend \\nherself. This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens, not \\ncriminals, follow the law and how this law-abiding young woman was \\nharmed by gun control laws.\\n  Another specific example related to this bill of a well-intentioned \\nlaw gone wrong is Carol Bowne, a New Jersey woman stabbed to death \\nwhile waiting to be approved for her firearm application. She already \\nhad an order of protection from the courts, but that wasn't enough for \\nher. She needed more than just that piece of paper. She needed to \\nprotect herself, so she went and tried to get a gun to defend herself, \\nbut because of the waiting period, she was killed.\\n  Let me repeat that. Carol Bowne had an order of protection. She \\nattempted to purchase a firearm, and she was tragically murdered by her \\nabuser while waiting to be approved.\\n  H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the \\ncountry, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger. \\nWomen who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a \\nmonth, like Carol.\\n  How many women will potentially suffer like Carol? And what will the \\nDemocrats say: Sorry; we hope you can hide from your abuser for a \\nmonth?\\n  Madam Speaker, that would be foolish as well as heartless. It would \\nbe an infringement of Second Amendment rights for someone who needs \\nthem the most.\\n  Given the insidious flaws in this bill, do we really want to burden \\nlaw-abiding victims by placing them in a never-ending cycle of \\nbackground checks? Of course not.\\n  This motion to recommit is a commonsense measure. It would ensure \\nthat domestic violence victims, many of whom live in fear, can receive \\nthe protection they need and deserve.\\n  Vote for this motion to recommit and you vote to protect domestic \\nviolence victims. Vote against the motion to recommit and you are \\ntelling victims who live in fear: Sorry; we won't help you.\\n  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to \\nrecommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\\n\\n\", cat_list={'Gun Control', 'Families & Children', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=836, text=\"  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, this week was, for all intents and \\npurposes, D.C. Statehood Week in the Capital. I am pleased that, today, \\nSenator Carper has announced that he is introducing the Washington, \\nD.C. Admission Act to make the District of Columbia the 51st State. I \\nam grateful to Senator Carper, who garnered a record number of Senate \\ncosponsors last year and has been a most vigorous champion of statehood \\nfor the District of Columbia.\\n  I come to the floor for my first time this session to discuss D.C. \\nstatehood because we have many new Members who may be under the \\nmistaken impression that the 700,000 people who live in your Nation's \\nCapital are treated in the same rights that your own residents are. I \\nbeg to differ.\\n  In this city, the citizens do not have each and every right in this \\nCongress. To be sure, we have what is called home rule, and I will \\nlater indicate that even that is limited.\\n  The reasons for this unique place, for our Capital, left without the \\nfull rights of other citizens, has to do with a quirk, an accident, \\nwhere the Framers came to believe that the Capital should not be part \\nof a State because they were, in the beginning, parts of various \\nStates, and they felt that they could not then control what the Capital \\nwould do.\\n  Well, of course, they don't want a Capital to be part of a State, but \\nthey didn't really envision statehood, the Capital as a State, because \\nthey were thinking of the Thirteen Colonies. And since every city had \\nto be in a State, they could only envision putting the city in a State.\\n  We are about 218 years beyond that, and it is time, way past time--\\nshall I say, overdue in time--to understand how the Nation's Capital of \\nthe greatest nation in the world should be viewed and what rights its \\ncitizens should have.\\n  So I am very grateful to Senator Carper for the work he has done and \\nfor his introduction of the bill in the Senate this week, the \\ncounterpart of the D.C. statehood bill, which I have already introduced \\nin the House.\\n  The bill I have introduced already has 198 cosponsors. I bet--I \\nhaven't looked closely, but there is probably no bill in the hopper \\nthat has more cosponsors than the D.C. statehood bill. It is not \\nbipartisan yet. That will happen, because this is how we make progress \\non matters in the House of Representatives. We go one House at a time.\\n  Remember, the District doesn't have any representation in the Senate; \\nyet we have gotten a distinguished Senator introducing the statehood \\nbill, and he has been most energetic, getting the majority of the \\nDemocratic Senators on the bill last session.\\n  I am particularly moved today because of the record number of D.C. \\nresidents and their colleagues who came to the Congress yesterday to \\ndemand that they have equal rights with all other American citizens. I \\ngreeted a room full of residents who had visited every office to tell \\nMembers what they don't know.\\n  I am grateful particularly that the Speaker of the House, Nancy \\nPelosi, has strongly endorsed D.C. statehood. I believe that means that \\nD.C. statehood will be on the floor this session. I want to thank our \\nSpeaker for making D.C. statehood a priority, and indicating in her own \\nwords how important it is that every citizen be treated equally.\\n  In the same way, Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah \\nCummings has committed to holding a hearing on D.C. statehood, and I \\nwill predict this afternoon on the floor that that bill will get out of \\ncommittee and come to the floor of the House for a vote.\\n\\n\\n  The progress we are making on D.C. statehood is also seen in the \\ninclusion of our statehood demands in what is called H.R. 1. That is an \\nall-democracy bill that tries to improve and make sure that full \\ndemocracy in every form is present in the United States. In H.R. 1 are \\nextensive findings for D.C. statehood.\\n  I thank the Democratic majority for including the District of \\nColumbia and its plea for statehood in this all important pro-democracy \\nbill. It is called the For the People Act, and H.R. 1 was the first \\nbill introduced.\\n  Most Members who come to the Congress come knowing only that the \\nNation's Capital is where all these wonderful memorial buildings are. \\nThey know that it is a tourist mecca. Many may have come as children or \\neven as adults, as tourists. They probably don't know that 30 million \\nvisitors from all over the world visit our Nation's Capital.\\n  In other words, most Members of the House who, by the way, will spend \\nmore time in the District of Columbia than they will spend at home, \\nstill don't know very much about their own Capital City. They probably \\ndon't know that only in America does the legislature not grant full \\nrepresentation to their Capital City.\\n  Well, I have just voted on the House floor. I vote on amendments, but \\nI did not vote on the final bill. I do vote in what is called the \\nCommittee of the Whole. The reason I am able to vote there is that, \\nwhen I first came to Congress in 1991, I saw that I could, indeed, vote \\nin committee, and I knew there was something called the Committee of \\nthe Whole.\\n  Well, what is the difference between voting in committee, like the \\nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, for example, where I have \\nalways served and voted, what is the difference between that and the \\nCommittee of the Whole? No difference.\\n\\n\\n  Both are committees that were created by the Congress, not the \\nConstitution.\\n  So, since I vote in committee, I asked for the right to vote in the \\nCommittee of the Whole. It was granted.\\n  But only in America, again, could the following happen: my Republican \\nfriends sued the House for allowing the vote in the Committee of the \\nWhole.\\n  The courts looked at that, pronounced the right of the Congress to \\ngive that vote in the Committee of the Whole, just as the District has \\nthe vote in committee, and my Republican friends then appealed.\\n  At the Court of Appeals, the verdict was, yes, the District of \\nColumbia can vote in the Committee of the Whole, just as they vote in \\ncommittee.\\n  And my good Republican friends didn't quite have the nerve to appeal \\nthat one to the Supreme Court, but what they did do, when Democrats \\nlost the House 2 years later, was to take away a vote, that the courts \\nhad said was legitimate, from the residents of the District of \\nColumbia, who are number one per capita in taxes paid to support the \\ngovernment of the United States. And therein lies the outrageous \\nanomaly.\\n  Those who pay the most taxes per capita have the least rights. That \\nis why we are determined to get our rights.\\n  Yes, I have just voted on two gun safety amendments that were on this \\nfloor today. I couldn't vote on the final bill, but I could vote on \\nthose amendments. They were important amendments relating to background \\nchecks.\\n  By the way, something like 97 percent of the American people in one \\npoll were shown to favor background checks. That means you check to see \\nif a person has a criminal background and shouldn't have a gun. What is \\nthe controversy in that one?\\n  So I was able to vote on those two amendments.\\n  This is all by way of self-help, thinking through what is it I can do \\nto make sure the people I represent have the maximum of representation \\nthey can. I sure am not crying about what I cannot do, when you \\nconsider what I can do.\\n  I am chair of the most important subcommittee now in the \\nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee. Through that committee, I \\nhave been able to rebuild whole parts of the District of Columbia: The \\nWharf, the Southwest Waterfront as it is called; the southeast \\nwaterfront, Capitol Riverfront; parts of Washington, like NoMa.\\n  I have been able to do a great deal. That is not the issue.\\n  The issue is equal. Not equal for me personally; equal for those I \\nrepresent, who have paid their dues without getting their rights.\\n  When I say, ``pay their dues,'' I want to elaborate on that. The city \\nI represent has one of the strongest economies in the Nation. It has a \\nbudget of about $14 billion. That is larger than the budget of 12 \\nStates. Many States are crying poor, trying to tax or not tax their \\nresidents, embroiled in that controversy.\\n  The city I represent has a $2 billion surplus. Its per capita income, \\nthe per capita income of the Americans who live in your Capital City, \\nis higher than that of any State.\\n  Now, we are about the equivalent in size of seven states. Our per \\ncapita income, though, is higher than that of any State. Take your \\nbiggest States, Texas and New York and California: higher per capita \\nincome. That tells you about how much economic activity there is in \\nyour Nation's capital.\\n  This city, which is something of a city state, has residents whose \\npersonal income is higher than that of seven States; we do not cry \\npoor.\\n  Our population growth is among the highest in the Nation. People want \\nto live in your Nation's capital. It is one of the most pleasant, \\nlivable cities in our country.\\n  What do they pay per capita in taxes? $12,000 per resident in taxes \\nto support a government that does not give them equal rights.\\n  Our Armed Forces--Armed Forces with representatives from every State, \\nit should be known--has always had residents of the District of \\nColumbia who fought and died in every war, including the war that \\ncreated the United States, the Revolutionary War. You, of course, are \\naware of that war, the war that was fought for taxation without \\nrepresentation. No wonder District residents are demanding that our \\nCongress live up to that great slogan and standard.\\n  Now, as I indicated, it is not as if we don't have any rights. The \\nCongress passed the Home Rule Act in 1974--I will speak later about the \\ndeficiencies of the Home Rule Act--but that means that the city does \\nhave its own elected mayor and its own elected legislature, its \\ncouncil.\\n  How did we get that? Well, first of all, it took over 100 years after \\nthe Civil War. The first home rule was given to the Capital City by \\nRepublicans in the 19th century who had fought and won the Civil War, \\nwhere those in my party the Democrats had fought on the side of \\nslavery.\\n  Republicans fought on the side of freedom, and when it saw it had a \\ncapital that did not have freedom, it gave the District home rule.\\n  Now, the Republicans had rather much lost their way, as the Democrats \\ncertainly had, for more than 100 years, but when Richard Nixon was \\nPresident of the United States, the Home Rule Act was passed.\\n  I would just like to read a few of his words. He said, in signing the \\nbill: ``As a longtime supporter of self-government for the District of \\nColumbia, I am pleased to sign into law a measure which is of historic \\nsignificance for the citizens of our Nation's Capital.''\\n  He went on to say: ``I,'' that is Richard Nixon, now, ``first voted \\nfor home rule as a Member of the House of Representatives in 1948, and \\nI have endorsed the enactment of home rule legislation during both my \\nterms as President.''\\n  This was bipartisan, finally. And Republicans, that party, that post-\\nwar party, post-World War II party, deserves credit for understanding \\nthat the time had come for the Capital City to have home rule.\\n  That home rule was not complete, in the sense that, and most \\nimportantly, the District budget has to come here, and it becomes a \\nfoil on which to press amendments to overturn laws that people may not \\nlike.\\n\\n  I have been able to defeat most of those riders, as we call them, or \\nattempts to take down D.C. laws, but the D.C. budget shouldn't come \\nhere at all.\\n  I recognized that while pursuing statehood, I could get close to \\nstatehood by simply finishing the Home\\n\\n\\nRule Act and making it whole and complete, and so I embarked on a two-\\ntrack road. One, of course, is the one I have just discussed: D.C. \\nstatehood.\\n  The other is what I call free and equal D.C. bills, bills that \\ntogether bring us close to statehood. I started with a congressional \\nreview amendment. This one is really nonsensical.\\n  The District passes a law. Ultimately, most of those laws matter not \\nto the Congress and certainly aren't overturned, but the Home Rule Act \\nsays that the law shall not become final for 30 days, and that is 30 \\nconsecutive days.\\n  The House is not in session consecutive days. This is Thursday, for \\nexample. We are out, so I don't know if it is 3 or 4 days this week \\nthat would be counted, but you have to count up till you get to 30 \\ndays, and then, of course, the bill can become law.\\n  Well, it always does. No one uses this particular power at all. If \\nthey want to overturn D.C. laws, then they simply try to attach it to \\nappropriations as they come.\\n  So this is completely unused, but it is terribly burdensome on the \\ncity, because you simply have to keep renewing these bills that have \\nbeen passed in the District until you get finally through the 30-day \\nperiod. It is ridiculous: not used by the Congress, burdensome on the \\ncity, should and could be gotten rid of without anyone noticing it in \\nthe Congress or caring about it. So I began with that one, which the \\nCongress can't possibly care about, because it doesn't even use it \\never.\\n  But look at some of the other things that could be done even without \\nstatehood, which is leading me to embark on this two-track system.\\n  For example, the District of Columbia does not have a local \\nprosecutor, like a district attorney, for example, or a state's \\nattorney.\\n  The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a Federal official, \\nnot chosen by the District of Columbia, but by the President of the \\nUnited States, is essentially the district attorney for the District of \\nColumbia. We have no say in this.\\n  And that U.S. attorney has a jurisdiction that has nothing to do with \\nwhat U.S. attorneys do in other States. It is local law. 90 percent of \\nwhat the U.S. attorney has as jurisdiction is local law, like the law a \\nDA would enforce. About 10, sometimes 15 percent of his work is \\nFederal.\\n  We want to send him back to all of his Federal work, give him time to \\ndo all of that so that we would have a local prosecutor.\\n  That is one of the bills that this Congress could pass, House and \\nSenate, and hardly think about it, because it is certainly \\nuncontroversial that the city have its own law enforcement officer to \\nenforce its criminal laws.\\n  And there is a National Guard rule act. Now, that is the equivalent \\nof what I am speaking of when I say that the Congress should have no \\ninterest, only the District.\\n  The National Guard cannot be called out in the event, for example, of \\na hurricane or a huge snowfall or a flood, only the President of the \\nUnited States can.\\n\\n\\n  The President of the United States does not need to be bothered with \\ntasks related to ordinary emergencies in the District of Columbia. \\nSomehow, the Mayor would have to find the President and say: Please \\ncall out the National Guard. That is the local National Guard.\\n  We don't want jurisdiction over the National Guard when it comes to \\nnational matters. We want the same jurisdiction that the States have. \\nThe States have the right to call out the National Guard to protect \\ntheir residents when there are natural disasters. That is, essentially, \\nwhat we are asking for. So that, too, is part of my Free and Equal D.C. \\nseries.\\n  Again, there are 20 of these bills. Let me just indicate one other: \\nthe District of Columbia Home Rule Clemency Act. I investigated how \\noften clemency is allowed or has been afforded, and I found only one \\ninstance. I will tell you why.\\n  The President of the United States alone can offer clemency to \\nsomeone who has broken local law. Do you think he bothers or, for that \\nmatter, should bother? That is why they don't post anyone who gets \\nclemency in the District of Columbia.\\n  These are the kind of local matters that are holdovers, absolute \\nholdovers, from the days when the District had no home rule. We can't \\npossibly hold our heads up as a democracy and have matters like this \\nthat cannot be attended at the local level.\\n  Occasionally, someone comes forward with the notion: We understand, \\nCongressman. We want to make sure that the residents of the Nation's \\nCapital have the same rights as other places. Here is what we would \\nlike to do. You come out of a portion of land, contributed by the State \\nof Maryland, so why not return the District of Columbia to Maryland, \\nthen you would get your full and equal rights?\\n  Well, the first thing you ought to do is ask Maryland about that. \\nThen you might ask the District of Columbia. And here I have the \\nanswers, I think.\\n  Statehood is endorsed by 86 percent of D.C. residents. Retrocession, \\nas it is called, has no constituency either in Maryland or in the \\nDistrict.\\n  This is how I know that.\\n  There was a poll taken in Maryland asking whether or not they thought \\nthe District of Columbia should be returned to Maryland. Now, \\nunderstand, Maryland is a very progressive jurisdiction, but it only \\nhas one big city. That is the city of Baltimore. It apparently is not \\nwelcoming of another city which has formed its own identity as a State \\nand, for that reason, has an identity as a big city.\\n  I am not surprised that a poll of Maryland legislators found that 92 \\npercent of Maryland Senators oppose retrocession of the District to \\nMaryland, and 82 percent of Maryland Delegates--that is their lower \\nhouse--oppose retrocession.\\n  What I think this points up is that there are no easy answers: taking \\na city that is almost as old as the Nation itself--the District became \\nthe Capital City in 1801--and somehow finding some easy answer, which \\nturns out to be even harder. It is hard enough to get the Congress to \\nrecognize statehood.\\n  Now, suppose we have to go to Maryland, in the case of retrocession, \\nand D.C. to get that answer. That is a harder road to climb. It is not \\ndemocratic, because that is not what Maryland wants and that is not \\nwhat the District of Columbia wants. It is a very mechanical answer to \\na very deep problem.\\n  I indicated that I just voted in the Congress in the Committee of the \\nWhole, and I have voted now, in this new Congress, which is about 8 \\nweeks old, two or three times. Each of those votes are of such great \\nsignificance to the people I represent. It encourages them to believe \\nthat they will have a vote not only in the Committee of the Whole, but \\nthey will have a vote where every other American has a vote.\\n  For them, I can only say that they have overpaid, in every \\nconceivable way, for equal rights--yes, by fighting and dying in every \\nwar and, yes, in Federal taxes paid, per capita, a larger amount than \\nany residents.\\n  For me, of course, this is a labor of love because I was born and \\nraised here. I am the daughter of a runaway slave who ran away from \\nVirginia.\\n  It is interesting that he ran away and found himself and settled in \\nthe District of Columbia as an illegal immigrant, I suppose--a runaway \\nslave--but there was work here. He found work in the city and began to \\nraise work helping to build the city because they were building the \\nroads of the city at that time in the 1830s.\\n  It was no part of his vision that the District would ever have the \\nsame rights as other Americans, certainly no part of his vision, as \\nthen still a slave, that he would have anything to do with it.\\n  So, this afternoon, as I think about my city and strive for its \\nequality, I think of my great-grandfather, Richard Holmes, who sought \\nfreedom for himself and his family the only way he could: by simply \\nwalking off of a plantation and making his way to the District of \\nColumbia. In his name, I am honored to seek more of that freedom and \\nequality for the 700,000 Americans who now live in our Nation's \\nCapital.\\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\\n\\n\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=849, text=\"  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just a couple of short weeks ago, we \\nfinally finished the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills, and I \\ngreatly appreciate those who worked with us to get that done.\\n  I want to talk today about the need to reach a new 2-year budget \\ndeal. We have to do that so the Appropriations Committee could then \\nbegin to work in earnest on the fiscal year 2020 bills.\\n  We have shown that we can move the appropriations bills quickly, but \\nwe have to have the budget deal. In fact, unless we will get a budget \\ndeal, sequestration returns in fiscal year 2020. That would mean steep \\ncuts in programs that invest in America and support working families.\\n  It means we would have to make cuts in our defense programs for the \\nnext fiscal year--cuts of $71 billion. This is real money. There would \\nbe a 10-percent cut in funding to support our troops and to invest in \\nmilitary readiness.\\n  It would also require that we cut $55 billion for nondefense programs \\nin the next fiscal year. That is a 9-percent cut. The reality is, it \\nmeans less investment in infrastructure, education, housing, or \\nagricultural programs. It means less money for veterans' healthcare, \\nprotecting our environment, or combating the opioid epidemic.\\n  These cuts are not just hypothetical numbers on a piece of paper. \\nThey affect real people and real families. They affect people in my \\nState. They affect the people in the State of the distinguished \\nPresiding Officer. They affect people in the 50 States represented by \\nall 100 of us.\\n  Of course, the worst part about that is the cuts will come at the \\nsame time we are facing significant increases in important programs \\nthat we have no control over.\\n  For example, we have to fund the decennial census. The Constitution \\nrequires us to have this census, and we have to fund it by $4 billion \\nif we are going to follow what the Constitution of the United States \\nrequires us to do in conducting the 2020 census.\\n  We have all talked about veterans' healthcare. We have had a \\nsignificant increase in the healthcare costs for veterans, and we have \\nto have significant increases in the budget if we are going to \\nadequately fund their health.\\n  The VA MISSION Act, which provides additional private care options \\nfor veterans, becomes effective in June of this year. That is going to \\ncost at least an additional $3 billion, and estimates could climb \\nsignificantly higher. That is on top of the $3 billion increase for VA \\nmedical care that we have already enabled through advance \\nappropriations.\\n  Then we are going to need an additional $1 billion to ensure that an \\nestimated 5 million people who receive affordable housing assistance \\ncan stay in their homes. In addition to these increased costs, we \\nexpect to lose nearly $4 billion in receipts and cost savings in other \\nprograms compared to this year.\\n  This may sound like just a whole lot of numbers. It is more than \\nthat. It means we have $15 billion right off the bat that we must \\naccount for above this year's levels. Of course, I am sure there will \\nbe more increases that we will have to address.\\n  As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know how hard \\nChairman Shelby and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get \\nthrough the bills we had this past year. We got them done, but it was \\nnot easy staying within levels.\\n\\n\\n  We have to have a 2-year budget deal. We have to negotiate it now. If \\nwe wait until the very last second to pass these bills, it will cost \\nthe taxpayers a lot more money because the Departments cannot plan. We \\nare not going to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it is going to \\nfix itself.\\n  Of course, again, in the Appropriations Committee, we try to work in \\na bipartisan way. But we cannot responsibly do our job in the absence \\nof cap levels that allow us to meet the needs of the American people.\\n  Again, this is not just an accounting issue. This is the security and \\nthe well-being of the greatest Nation on Earth. It is not rhetoric; it \\nis reality.\\n  The budget deal has to be based on parity if we are going to pass it. \\nIt has to have equal treatment for defense and nondefense programs, as \\nwe have had in the past.\\n  We have to invest on both sides of the ledger if we are going to \\ncreate a strong national defense, a strong economy, and a healthy \\ncitizenry of the United States.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \\na letter to all Senators that was received yesterday from over 300 \\nretired admirals and generals who agree with this premise.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=850, text=\"  Mr. LEAHY. These admirals and generals, many of whom I know and a lot \\nof whom I do not, have been here with Republican and Democratic \\nadministrations, but they are all people who have served our Nation and \\ncare about our Nation. They are part of a coalition called Mission: \\nReadiness, Council for a Strong America. They call on Congress to \\nnegotiate balanced investments in both defense and nondefense programs.\\n  They wrote: ``As members of Mission: Readiness, we recognize the fact \\nthat the strength of our military--and our Nation--is dependent on the \\nstrength of our people.''\\n  We have certainly seen this. You can go back to the time of World War \\nII, when Harry Truman found that we could not find the people we needed \\nin our military because of things like malnutrition or a lack of \\neducation; we needed to improve the nutrition programs in our schools. \\nThis is not rhetoric; it is reality.\\n  These admirals and generals want a strong United States of America, \\njust as I do and just as every single Member of this body--of either \\nparty--wants.\\n  If the press reports are accurate, the President is planning to send \\nup a budget on March 11 that not only fails to provide a constructive \\npath forward, but it is going to be dead on arrival. If press reports \\nare accurate, the President will, yet again, propose deep cuts to \\nnondefense programs, even though Congress has rejected President \\nTrump's cuts for the last 2 fiscal years. Every Republican and every \\nDemocrat knows that you have to have a balance between defense and \\nnondefense programs.\\n  President Trump also proposes large increases for defense programs, \\npaid for using a budget gimmick that his own Acting Chief of Staff, \\nMick Mulvaney, would rail against when he was in Congress. He says he \\nwill move large portions of the defense base budget into the Overseas \\nContingency Operation, or OCO, account so that it will not count \\nagainst the budget caps. Mick Mulvaney and most Republicans and \\nDemocrats have said we cannot do this. It is not a recipe for success.\\n  OCO is meant for costs associated with military operations in \\nAfghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. It is there to address crises overseas. \\nIt supports our men and women deployed and in harm's way.\\n  The OCO account should not be used as a slush fund to pay for the \\neveryday operations of the Department of Defense or to avoid a real \\ndebate on the budget caps.\\n  To suggest we should move billions in the base defense budget into \\nOCO at a time when the President is actively reducing our troop \\npresence overseas shows what a disingenuous move it is.\\n  I went back in my notes, and I found a letter written by then-\\nCongressman Mick Mulvaney--now the acting Chief of Staff for President \\nTrump. He wrote this in March of 2014. It is strikingly relevant today, \\n5 years later. Then-Congressman Mulvaney wrote a letter signed by \\nnumerous Members. He opposed a $10 billion increase in OCO, calling it \\nis a ``misuse'' of funds and an attempt to ``circumvent the caps'' for \\nthings unrelated to overseas combat at a time when war operations were \\n``winding down.'' He opposed the gimmick. He argued for greater \\ntransparency and discipline in the budget process.\\n  He said he would not want any President--well, of course, in that \\ncase, it was President Obama--to have this power. Now he is Acting \\nChief of Staff of another President, and we are told the President may \\npropose an increase of $105 billion, more than doubling OCO funding, as \\nwe are withdrawing troops. That is not the way forward.\\n  Let's have an honest conversation, Republicans and Democrats \\ntogether, about our needs as a nation. We have to do the hard work to \\nset new caps. It is not easy. Every one of us will have to cast \\ndifficult votes. Well, so what? We are elected to a 6-year term. There \\nis not a single Member of this body who, at one time or another during \\ntheir campaigns, did not say something to the effect of ``I am willing \\nto cast tough votes.''\\n  Well, let us have it, this onerous conversation. Let us do the hard \\nwork to set new caps. Let us cast those difficult votes. Let us show \\nthe people who elected us they did the right thing. Let us invest in \\nthe programs. Let us strengthen our military, grow our economy, improve \\nour infrastructure, and build the future of this country we love. Let \\nus not use a budget gimmick to frustrate that debate. Trust me, the \\nAmerican people will see through that kind of a gimmick.\\n\\n\\n  I am ready to have those conversations. I want to move forward with \\nthe fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills. Let's get the work done the \\nAmerican people sent us here to do. If we have to stay a few evenings \\nand if we have to stay a few weekends, let's do it. It is for the \\ngreatest Nation on Earth. Let's do it. I urge leadership on both sides \\nof the aisle, in both Chambers of Congress, to begin these negotiations \\nnow.\\n  Then we have to take up, with urgency, a disaster package. In the \\nlast 2 years, we have had the deadliest disaster seasons in recent \\nmemory--Hurricanes Michael, Florence, Irma, and Maria, the California \\nwildfires, volcanic eruptions in Hawaii, and typhoons along the Pacific \\ncoast. These communities, States, and territories need our help.\\n  When Tropical Storm Irene hit Vermont in 2011, I found out firsthand \\nhow devastating natural disasters can be. Roads were washed away, towns \\nand villages were cut off from vital services, and people's homes were \\ndestroyed.\\n  The day after Irene, I went around the State of Vermont with our \\nGovernor and with the head of our National Guard in a helicopter, \\nlanding in small towns. Many times the only way you could get into \\nthese towns was by helicopter because roads were gone and the bridges \\nwere gone.\\n  You would see bridges, like a child's toy, twisted and a mile from \\nwhere it was supposed to be. A farmhouse that had been on the north \\nside of the river was now upside down on the south side of the river. \\nWe were in the middle of the State, and we knew it was critical. The \\nFederal Government provided assistance to help recovery because we are \\npart of the United States of America.\\n  The people of Puerto Rico and others that have been so badly damaged, \\nthese are Americans. We should stand together to help them. I am sorry \\nwe were not able to reach agreement to include a disaster package in \\nthe fiscal year 2019 minibus we passed just 2 weeks ago. We were so \\nclose to an agreement on a package--so very close, Republicans and \\nDemocrats alike. It would have addressed the needs of all impacted \\ncommunities.\\n  It broke down because the President insisted we eliminate disaster \\nassistance for Puerto Rico. I guess he thought tossing rolls of paper \\ntowels for the people is good enough. Puerto Rico is part of the United \\nStates. It is not, as the White House described it, an island \\nsurrounded by water, I guess, as compared to those other islands. It is \\na part of the United States. These are American people. They have \\nserved in our military. They help us in our medical facilities. They \\nare Americans, and they cannot be left out.\\n  Hurricanes Maria and Irma--they had two hurricanes--devastated Puerto \\nRico. They destroyed the island's homes and infrastructure. They caused \\nthe deaths of an estimated 2,975 people. It was one of the deadliest \\nhurricanes our country has ever seen, certainly in my lifetime.\\n  Now, we provided Puerto Rico assistance in past disaster bills, but \\nthey have so many unaddressed needs that have to be met. Many people, \\neven after the hurricane, are still living in temporary housing. Roads, \\nbridges, and communities still need to be rebuilt. One of the largest \\ninfrastructure projects to be undertaken on the island is the \\nrebuilding of Puerto Rico's energy grid, which needs more assistance.\\n  Most importantly, in the absence of supplemental assistance, we \\nestimate that 140,000 Puerto Ricans, U.S. citizens, are going to lose \\nnutrition assistance at the end of March.\\n  We are the United States of America--United States of America--and \\nthis is the U.S. Senate. We are supposed to take care of all our \\ncitizens when they have crises. We do not pick and choose based on with \\nwhom we are politically aligned.\\n  I voted for disaster relief for States that were predominantly \\nRepublican and other States that were predominantly Democratic, but I \\ndon't look at it like that. I look at the fact that they are part of \\nthe United States of America, and they had a disaster. They should be \\nhelped.\\n  Last month, the House passed H.R. 268, a comprehensive disaster \\npackage that provided over $14 billion to help all States and \\nterritories impacted by recent disasters to help them recover and \\nrebuild. I worked closely with the House on this bill. I believe it \\nwill address the needs of all disaster-impacted communities.\\n  On Tuesday, Senators Perdue and Jones and others, working very hard, \\nintroduced a similar but not identical bill. I am taking these bills \\nwith me this weekend. I am going to review them carefully. I thank the \\nbipartisan group of Senators--Senators Perdue and Jones and others--for \\nbringing the issue back to the forefront of the Senate. I am certainly \\ncommitted to working with my good friend Chairman Shelby. I also worked \\nwith Republicans and Democrats in the House Appropriations Committee. I \\nwant a package that can pass both Chambers in addressing the needs of \\nall States and territories hit by recent disasters.\\n  I certainly urge the majority leader, Senator McConnell, to commit to \\nbringing this to the floor as soon as possible. With that, I see other \\nSenators on the floor.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=852, text=\"  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, in the context of the ongoing \\nnegotiations with North Korea, there has been a lot of discussion today \\nin the media about Otto Warmbier.\\n  Otto Warmbier was a young man from my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. \\nThis is an emotional issue for me because, through the process of \\ntrying to bring Otto home, I got to know his family very well.\\n  He was a young man with a lot of promise, 22 years old, and a college \\nstudent at the University of Virginia. He had gone as a tourist to \\nNorth Korea. He was pulled out of the line at the airport.\\n  Here he was, a kindhearted college kid, found himself a prisoner in \\nNorth Korea. He was there for about 18 months. His detainment and his \\nsentence were appalling; unacceptable by any standards. At some point \\nsoon after being sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, from what we \\nknow, Otto suffered a severe brain injury. What happened? We may never \\nknow the details, but we do know one thing, and that is he was severely \\nmistreated.\\n  Who did the North Korean Government tell about the fact that he had \\nthis brain damage? No one. Unbelievably, for the next 15 months of his \\nlife, they kept this a secret. They denied him access to the best \\nmedical care he deserved, which of course we would have provided.\\n  I was in communication with the North Korean Government during this \\ntime through their offices at the United Nations in New York. They \\ndidn't even tell us about the terrible mistreatment he had suffered and \\nthe condition he was in. They refused repeated requests for consular \\naccess that normally would have been provided to someone who has been \\ndetained, regardless of their health situation. This included denying \\nrequests, of course, from me, from others in this body and other bodies \\nof Congress but also from the Obama administration, the Trump \\nadministration, the Red Cross, also from the Government of Sweden, \\nwhich typically acts for us in North Korea as a consular service. I say \\nthat because while I support engagement with North Korea--in fact, in \\nmy experience with Otto Warmbier, it makes me even more convinced we \\nneed to have communication because we had no good lines of \\ncommunication.\\n  I support the ongoing talks with North Korea, specifically about \\ndenuclearization. I want to make clear that we can never forget about \\nOtto. His treatment at the hands of his captors was unforgivable, and \\nit tells us a lot about the nature of the regime. We can't be naive \\nabout what they did to Otto, about the brutal nature of the regime that \\nwould do this to an American citizen.\\n  Of course, it is not just about Otto or other visitors. It is about \\nhow the people of North Korea are treated, many of whom also have had \\ntheir human rights violated. No one should have to go through what the \\nWarmbier family has gone through. They have been incredibly strong, by \\nthe way, through this whole ordeal. I watched them channel their grief \\ninto something constructive, exposing some of the human rights abuses \\nin North Korea, as an example.\\n\\n\\n  Throughout this ordeal, I have stood with Fred and Cindy and their \\nentire family. I will continue to, but I also want to say today, as we \\ndiscuss these broader issues with North Korea, let's keep Otto Warmbier \\nat the front of our minds. Let's be sure he is high on our agenda and \\nin our consciousness as we deal with North Korea and, again, \\nunderstanding, because of our experience with Otto, the brutal nature \\nof this regime.\\n\\n\\n                          China Investigation\\n\\n  Mr. President, I will now talk about the Permanent Subcommittee on \\nInvestigations' hearing we had today.\\n  I am here to talk about China and the impact it is having on the U.S. \\neducation system. I chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \\nwhich is a subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \\nCommittee. My colleague Tom Carper, on the other side of the aisle, is \\nthe ranking member. We worked together on bipartisan--I believe you \\nwould say nonpartisan investigations.\\n  We had success working on the opioid crisis in coming up with \\nlegislation to stop fentanyl from coming through the mail, the \\ndeadliest of all the drugs. We also had success in pushing back against \\nhuman trafficking, leading to actually shutting down the website that \\ntrafficked more women and children than any other one, backpage.com.\\n  Today we looked at something that is also very important for our \\ncountry; that is, understanding better how these Confucius Institutes \\nwork. We issued a bipartisan report today talking about how there is a \\nlack of transparency in how American colleges and universities manage \\ntheir Confucius Institutes. These are located at more than 100 colleges \\nand universities around the country. These institutions in America have \\nreceived more than $150 million in support from the Government of China \\nfor these Confucius Institutes since 2006.\\n  Confucius Institutes are enterprises that engage in the teaching of \\nChinese culture and language, and they are at universities and colleges \\naround the world. These Confucius Institutes are designed, funded, and \\nprimarily staffed by the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government \\nbills them as an opportunity for cultural exchange, and the funding \\ncomes from them. It is an appealing prospect for many U.S. schools \\ntrying to meet their demand for language instruction, but we need to be \\ncareful.\\n  There needs to be more transparency in how these institutes operate \\nin the United States, and there needs to be more reciprocity so the \\nUnited States can also provide its cultural institutions in China. That \\nis not happening now because China has systematically shut down \\ncomparable U.S. State Department public diplomacy efforts on college \\ncampuses in China.\\n  Let me be clear. I do support cultural exchange--we all should; it is \\na good thing--with China and with the international community more \\nbroadly, but there needs to be reciprocity, and there needs to be \\nappropriate engagement without, in this case, the Chinese Government \\ndetermining what is said and what is done on U.S. campuses.\\n  The law must be followed. That is why transparency is so important.\\n  This morning we held a hearing following an 8-month investigation \\ninto this issue. Based on our findings, let me focus on these two \\nissues of transparency and reciprocity--transparency in how colleges \\nand universities manage the institutes which are controlled, funded, \\nand mostly staffed by the Chinese Government and the lack of \\nreciprocity in how China does not permit U.S. State Department \\nprogramming in China.\\n  Our report details how China, known for its one-sided dealings in \\ntrade--not having a level playing field in trade--also does not have a \\nlevel playing field with regard to these cultural changes.\\n  Our report documents how U.S. officials had expressed concerns about \\nChina's influence through its Confucius Institutes. Recently, the FBI's \\nAssistant Director for Counterintelligence testified before the Senate \\nJudiciary Committee that the Confucius Institutes are ``not strictly a \\ncultural institute'' and that ``they are ultimately beholden to the \\nChinese government.'' The State Department has labeled Confucius \\nInstitutes ``China's most prominent soft power platform.''\\n  Higher education groups have also expressed concern. The American \\nCouncil of Education, the National Association of Scholars, and the \\nAmerican Association of University Professors have all recommended that \\nU.S. schools fundamentally change how they manage Confucius Institutes \\nor consider shutting them down.\\n  Other foreign governments have already acted. For example, the UK \\nConservative Party Commission on Human Rights called for the suspension \\nof further agreements until it can complete a more comprehensive review \\nof potential threats to academic freedom at the Confucius Institutes in \\nthe United Kingdom.\\n  The Canadian Province of New Brunswick recently announced that it \\nwould cease its Confucius Institute operations, citing academic freedom \\nconcerns and that the program provides a ``one-dimensional'' view of \\nChina. Finally, an Australian State, New South Wales, is currently \\nreviewing the Confucius Institute program, citing that it exposes \\nchildren to propaganda.\\n  These concerns are well-founded. Past statements by Chinese officials \\nmake clear the purpose of Confucius Institutes. For example, in 2011, a \\nformer member of the Chinese Government explained:\\n\\n       The Confucius Institute is an appealing brand for expanding \\n     our culture abroad. It has made an important contribution \\n     toward improving our soft power. The ``Confucius'' brand has \\n     a natural attractiveness. Using the excuse of teaching \\n     Chinese language, everything looks reasonable and logical.\\n\\n  The Director General of Confucius Institute Headquarters has also \\ncommented on how the program controls messaging about controversial \\ntopics. She said in 2014:\\n\\n       Every mainland China teacher we send . . . will say Taiwan \\n     belongs to China. We should have one China. No hesitation.\\n\\n  So with regard to issues like Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square, \\nthe Confucius Institutes stay away from those issues that are \\nconsidered controversial.\\n  We know that Confucius Institutes exist as one part of China's \\nbroader, long-term strategy, but China has invested heavily in them, \\ngiving about $150 million to U.S. schools just in the last decade. \\nChina's other long-term initiatives include its Made in China 2025 \\nplan, which is a push to lead the world in certain advanced technology \\nmanufacturing. The Thousand Talents Program is another state-run \\ninitiative designed to recruit Chinese researchers in the United States \\nto return to China for significant financial gain, bringing with them \\nthe research knowledge gained at U.S. universities and companies. We \\nplan on continuing to examine the U.S. Government's responses to these \\nissues as well.\\n  Confucius Institutes, by the way, do not stop at colleges and \\nuniversities alone. China has also opened more than 500 Confucius \\nClassrooms programs at U.S. K-12 schools. In fact, the Confucius \\nClassroom program is a priority for the Chinese Government. A document \\nobtained by the subcommittee during our investigation details a plan to \\nexpand Confucius Classrooms by seeking ``top-down policy support from \\nthe state government, legislative and educational institutions, with \\nparticular emphasis on access to the support from school district \\nsuperintendents and principals.''\\n  Over the last 8 months, we interviewed U.S. school officials, \\nteachers, and Confucius Institute instructors. We also reviewed tens of \\nthousands of pages of contracts, emails, financial records, and other \\ninternal documents obtained from more than 100 U.S. schools that were \\neither active or recently closed Confucius Institutes.\\n  Since our investigation started, more than 10 U.S. schools announced \\nthey would be closing their Confucius Institutes. We found that Chinese \\nfunding for Confucius Institutes comes with strings attached--strings \\nthat can compromise academic freedom. The Chinese Government vets and \\napproves all Chinese directors and teachers, events, research \\nproposals, and speakers at U.S. Confucius Institutes. Chinese teachers \\nsign contracts pledging with the Chinese Government that they will \\nfollow Chinese law and ``conscientiously safeguard China's national \\ninterests.''\\n  Some schools actually contractually agreed that both Chinese and U.S. \\nlaw will apply at Confucius Institutes in\\n\\n\\nthe United States on their school campuses. Think about that. American \\nuniversities are agreeing to comply with Chinese law on their campuses. \\nThis application of Chinese law at these schools can result, of course, \\nin exporting China's censorship of political debate and prevent \\ndiscussion of politically sensitive topics.\\n  As such, numerous U.S. school officials told the subcommittee that \\nConfucius Institutes were not the place to discuss topics like the \\nindependence of Taiwan, Tibet, or the Tiananmen Square massacre. Put \\nsimply, as one U.S. school administrator told us: ``You know what \\nyou're getting when something is funded by the Chinese government.''\\n  Investigators from the Government Accountability Office also spoke \\nwith U.S. officials, who acknowledge that hosting the Confucius \\nInstitute could limit events or activities critical of China, not just \\nat the Confucius Institute but also elsewhere on campus.\\n  In response to the growing popularity of Confucius Institutes, the \\nUnited States initiated its own public diplomacy program in China \\nthrough the State Department. The Chinese Government effectively shut \\nit down. Since 2010, the State Department has provided $5.1 million in \\ngrant funding for 29 American Cultural Centers in China. Through this \\nprogram, a U.S. school would partner with a Chinese school to set up a \\ncultural center, which would enable Chinese students to better \\nunderstand our country, our culture.\\n  The Chinese Government stifled the program from the start. Seven of \\nthe 29 American Cultural Centers never even opened. Of those that did \\nopen, they needed permission from the Chinese partner schools, \\nsometimes including local Chinese Communist Party officials, just to \\nhold events. Eventually, because of the obstacles, the State Department \\nstopped funding the program altogether. There are four programs \\nremaining. They are all going to be phased out entirely by this summer.\\n  We heard some very interesting testimony today from the State \\nDepartment--testimony that details the academic environment in China \\nthat has made it impossible for us to have the kind of freedom they \\nenjoy over here. The State Department testimony aligns with the \\nfindings of our investigation.\\n  For example, while the State Department conducts various public \\ndiplomacy programs in China, the Chinese Government has increasingly \\nimpeded access to some segments of Chinese society, including Chinese \\nschools and universities. All Chinese institutions, including \\nuniversities, have a foreign affairs officer or a ``gatekeeper'' that \\nis an internal governmental office that manages contact between the \\nnon-Chinese entities and the institution. Any Chinese institutions that \\nwish to interact with foreign government officials must obtain approval \\nfirst from this gatekeeper.\\n  The State Department even told us that the Fulbright Program, a \\nprestigious and longstanding student exchange program, is impeded as \\nChinese authorities have prevented Chinese alumni of the Fulbright \\nProgram from forming a Fulbright Association, a standard practice in \\nother countries. We even heard directly from an American educator who \\nwas detained by the Chinese police and questioned extensively about her \\ninvolvement with a State Department grant. While the Department of \\nState said they conveyed to the Chinese Government that it expects \\nreciprocal access for U.S. diplomats in our programs, it is not \\nhappening. Obviously, more needs to be done.\\n  While the State Department is mostly known for its overseas \\ndiplomatic efforts, it also has oversight responsibilities right here \\nin the United States with regard to these Confucius Institutes. The \\nState Department conducts field site reviews to ensure that foreign \\nnationals who come to the United States on these Exchange Visitor \\nPrograms have visas that are appropriate and that they are here for the \\nstated reason.\\n  There are roughly 100 Confucius Institutes at colleges and \\nuniversities in America, yet the State Department has conducted field \\nvisits only to two of them. At those two, they found serious problems. \\nAt the Confucius Institute, the State Department revoked more than 30 \\nvisas for Chinese visitors who were supposed to be working at the \\nuniversity that sponsored their visa but were actually teaching in the \\nK-12 environment. They also discovered evidence of ``fraudulent \\npaperwork and coaching'' that was a ``deliberate attempt to deceive'' \\ninvestigators, according to the State Department.\\n  The Chinese director coached the Chinese teachers to tell the State \\nDepartment they were working on research programs that they really \\nweren't working on at the university's campus.\\n  State also told us it does not collect the visa information \\nspecifically related to the Confucius Institute, so we don't know how \\nmany Confucius Institute teachers there are or where they are. Again, \\nthey visited only 2 schools out of 100, and in those they found serious \\nproblems with regard to the State Department's responsibilities on \\nvisas.\\n  Our investigation also identified failures at the Department of \\nEducation that have contributed to a lack of transparency and oversight \\nat schools that take money from foreign governments. If a U.S. school \\nreceives more than $250,000 from a single foreign source in 1 year, it \\nis required by law to report that data to the Department of Education, \\nwhich, in turn, publishes it on its website. The Department of \\nEducation, however, has not issued any guidance on foreign gift \\nreporting for 14 years, the same year that China opened its first \\nConfucius Institute, and our investigation was able to find that 70 \\npercent of the colleges and universities that should have reported \\nreceiving funds for Confucius Institutes from China did not; 70 percent \\nare out of compliance. When a school fails to report a foreign gift, \\nthe Department of Justice can force the school to comply, but only at \\nthe request of the Secretary of Education. The Department of Education \\nhas never referred this type of case to them--never.\\n  We received two important commitments at the hearing this morning. \\nOne is the Department of Education has committed to issuing new \\nguidance to the more than 3,000 schools it oversees. This guidance is \\nimportant to ensure that schools know that they are obligated to report \\nreceiving these foreign government funding sources. They also agreed to \\nstep up their enforcement on the law on reporting foreign government \\nfunds from Confucius Institutes.\\n  The State Department committed this morning to do more to ensure \\nvisas are being properly used at Confucius Institutes around the \\ncountry. Again, they conducted only two site reviews. They have to do \\nmore, and they said they will. We are going to follow up on that.\\n  As with all of our investigations, we are developing legislation \\naimed at addressing the problems identified here today. I want to call \\nattention, as I conclude, to a news report that came out just a couple \\nof days ago. The Chinese Communist Party's central committee and the \\nCabinet published a document stating that the Confucius Institutes will \\nremain ``a key government policy.'' Specifically, the news report plans \\nto ``optimize'' the spread of Confucius Institutes. While it is unclear \\nwhat ``optimize'' means at this point, any legislation must try to \\nanticipate the potential rebranding of Confucius Institutes or other \\nefforts that may seek to avoid the transparency, disclosure, and \\nreciprocity that is needed if these programs are to continue on our \\ncampuses.\\n  Thank you.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=854, text=\"  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my good friend from Georgia has to \\nget somewhere, and I have to get somewhere. I will be very brief.\\n  I want to take a moment to pay tribute. We have staffers here who are \\njust unsung heroes. They work day in and day out. Because of their \\ndiligent work, the world and the country is a better place.\\n  One of these people who works in quiet dignity and gets so much done \\nand is so well respected is Bruce King. He has been indispensable at my \\noffice, and today, this afternoon, it is my unfortunate duty to say \\nfarewell to Bruce.\\n  He has worked in the Senate in some capacity since 1984. He has \\nworked for Judiciary, Senator Lautenberg, the Budget Committee, and as \\nthe senior\\n\\n\\ncounsel for multiple Democratic leaders on the Federal budget, \\nstretching from Leader Daschle to Leader Reid to me. In that short \\ntime, Bruce wasn't short of legislative achievement, from negotiating \\nthe balanced budget agreement of 1997 to blocking the privatization of \\nSocial Security in 2006, from shepherding health reform through the \\nSenate to passing the financial rescue bill after the crisis in 2008.\\n  One of our most distinguished Senators would be proud of that record. \\nTheir name would be in lights. Bruce did all of that and much more in \\nhis, as I said, quiet, steadfast, brilliant dignity.\\n  I have never sat on the Budget or Appropriations Committees, so when \\nI became leader, having his experience and wisdom was incredible. I \\nhave met no one who could take these complex issues and put them in \\nterms that even someone like myself could understand, not being an \\nexpert on those things. He was able to understand the big picture and \\nnever get caught in the minutia, although he knew the minutia extremely \\nwell.\\n  When you ask Bruce's opinion on a matter, he presents it so \\nsuccinctly and persuasively that you know it is the right answer in a \\nmatter of minutes, until he decides to play devil's advocate against \\nhis first opinion and convinces you of the opposite because he is one \\nof those staffers who has never had an ax to grind. He said: Let my \\nSenators know both sides, and let them decide.\\n\\n  But we knew both sides so well and so lucidly because of Bruce's \\nability to take these issues and help us understand them.\\n  He can juggle so many variables in his head at once. He can weigh the \\npros and cons. He has an instinctive knowledge of how to deal with the \\ntradeoffs, and he can keep it all in a simple way.\\n  He is a modest man. He has sat at the same desk in the Capitol for 14 \\nyears. Every day, he brings his lunch--peanut butter and jelly \\nsandwiches--and he leaves the office at almost the same time every \\nnight to have dinner at home with Janis, his beloved wife.\\n  Senators get the spotlight and the credit when our initiatives \\nsucceed, but so many initiatives would never have succeeded without \\nBruce King. Bruce, through the years, deserves an ocean of credit for \\nhis work. He would never claim a drop of it because he is a humble man.\\n  For all his expertise, he is humble, kindhearted, and thoughtful. \\nEveryone likes him. In all the years he has worked here, I never heard \\na single person say a single bad thing about him. That is a pretty good \\ntribute in a place like the Senate.\\n  Bruce's departure will be a loss to his friends and colleagues and to \\nthe Senate as a whole and, of course, to my office.\\n  There is only one bad thing I can say about him. He switched his \\nallegiance from the New York Mets to the Nationals. The good news is \\nthat he will be able to catch some more games with Janis, his son \\nAaron, and his daughter Liana.\\n  Bruce, you are a blessing to our office, to the Senate, and to the \\ncountry.

      "Pandas(Index=856, text=\"  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, to the Democratic leader and Bruce, who \\nis on the floor, congratulations on behalf of all the Republicans in \\nthe room.\\n  Come down to Atlanta and watch the Braves play the Mets. We would be \\nhappy to have you anytime. Thank you for your time here.\\n\\n\\n                            Disaster Relief\\n\\n  Mr. President, I will be very brief. Two things happen at this time \\nof day every day in the Senate and only two. The first is that the last \\nperson having their say finally gets up and says it, which means that \\nyou all have to listen to me for a minute. When the last person speaks, \\nthey don't tell you anything new. They tell you what everybody else \\nsaid in a different way. You get to hear a small speech about that.\\n  The other thing that happens is that Sheldon Whitehouse comes to the \\nfloor and talks about global warming. That happens every day. Sheldon \\nhasn't been down here. I don't know if he is sick. I don't know where \\nhe is. I am going to replace Sheldon for a minute.\\n  Every day goes by, and we ought to talk about climate change and \\nthings like that. I am going to talk about disaster relief, which ties \\nright into climate change. I am not a global warming guy, except to say \\nI think it is going on. It has been going on since the planet was \\ncreated. It will be going on long since we are gone. How tough it is \\ndepends on our dealing with it--how we sequester carbon, how we manage \\ncarbon, and how we have businesses and industries find new ways to fuel \\ntheir industries and fuel their mechanisms, and things like that.\\n  Tell Sheldon when you see him that I came down to talk about how we \\ndo need to address these things. It is all of our responsibility. We \\ncan address it in a positive way, just like we did in the Montreal \\nProtocol, where 25 years ago we got rid of fluorocarbons that were \\ndrilling a hole in the atmosphere and causing us to have terrible \\ncancer of the skin.\\n  Tell Sheldon I have listened to him. I heard some of his great \\nspeeches. Mine is not nearly as close to how good his are. I wanted to \\nmake sure a day didn't go by without our saying what Sheldon says.\\n  I want to talk about the disaster bill that Senator Leahy, only a few \\nminutes ago on the floor, talked about, and I want to talk about the \\nurgent job we need to do in the Senate.\\n  We had terrible disasters in the South and Southeast 3 years ago. We \\nhad hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. Billions of dollars were lost in \\nSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and other \\nlocations. We failed to meet the disaster demands that we have to help \\nthose farmers and ag producers and business and industries to get back \\non their feet.\\n  We now have a dire crisis. We have an emergency in the Southeast. It \\nis time we got the disaster bill that we have been trying to pass for a \\nyear passed. We had it as a rider twice. We had it as a rider on the \\nbill that was going to end the shutdown. At the last minute, it got \\nnegotiated out of the picture, not because it was a bad bill but \\nbecause nobody would leave it in there and it did free up some money.\\n  We have until March 15 to get it done. If we don't, there are going \\nto be farmers in most of the Southeast who are going out of business. \\nIndustries that this Nation depends on will be terrible. You will pay \\nway too much for your food. I don't know about you, but if you don't \\nhave nutrition to go with the energy you need, you don't have anything.\\n  I am here to plead with every Democrat and every Republican that when \\nwe get the bill to the floor--and it will be some time before March \\n15--to support the disaster relief bill for the Southeastern United \\nStates and for Puerto Rico. The Democrats wanted so badly to add Puerto \\nRico to it, and the President signed off on that part. So we don't have \\na problem with the executive branch. I ask you to support all of the \\nother provisions in it to see that those who were so badly damaged get \\ntheir relief.\\n  Let me tell you what that relief is. I am not talking about a \\nhandout. As an example, I am talking about the pecan industry that is \\nhoused in my State of Georgia. It is a tremendous industry in Asia. It \\nis a tremendous export in the United States, with a tremendous balance \\nof payments which contribute to our country. Well, 70 percent was wiped \\nout. It takes 15 to 20 years to replace a pecan orchard. They have to \\nstart growth from a seedling to be a full, maturing tree to produce the \\ncrops to get to the marketplace.\\n  Some of our crops are annual crops. A lot of them are long-term \\nlongevity crops. It is very important that we get them back on their \\nfeet. We will reclaim our place in the marketplace, but if we don't, \\nsomebody will take it away from us. Maybe it is Egypt, maybe it is \\nIndia, or maybe it is somebody else.\\n  I am down here to say that climate does change and we can do \\nsomething about it by addressing carbon. And the economy changes. We \\ncan do something about it by helping industries.\\n  When disasters come, if they are not responded to quickly and \\nresolutely, they end up causing big losses to everybody in business, in \\nproductivity, and in our industries.\\n  I want to ask everybody on the floor to please join me--hopefully, \\nbefore the 15th or at least by the 14th of March--\\n\\n\\nto support the disaster bill that passed. Senator Shelby, Senator \\nLeahy, myself, Senator Perdue, and Senator Rubio, and many others \\nworked very hard on this to bring it together to get the pieces that \\nwere missing in place.\\n  I want to thank, particularly, Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy for \\nthe time they and their staff have given us in the last couple of weeks \\nto try to recover from the vote 2 weeks ago, when we lost what we \\nthought was a solution to this problem.\\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time on the floor.\\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=859, text=\"  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \\nclimate change--to talk about something that is a pressing and real \\nproblem that affects everyone in this country, and, in fact, in our \\nworld. It is a challenge that we can't afford to ignore any longer \\nbecause the health of our families, our economy, our environment, and \\neven our national security, quite literally, depend on our ability to \\naddress it and address it promptly.\\n  After a year of recordbreaking extreme weather in 2018--when we saw \\nrising average temperatures fuel California's deadliest wildfire season \\non record, when Florida was faced with the strongest hurricane ever to \\nreach that State's panhandle, and when farmers in Delaware and across \\nthe country faced challenges due to severe flooding and drought--it is \\nclear that we can't afford to sit back and do nothing about climate \\nchange while the American people pay the price.\\n  The costs of our inaction are real--real in human suffering, real in \\ndisaster recovery spending, real in lost economic opportunity, and real \\nin the burden borne by our Armed Forces around the world.\\n  Yes, there is a clear link between climate change and national \\nsecurity. The Pentagon has consistently pointed to climate change as a \\nreal national security threat that will make the military's job around \\nthe world harder. National security leaders from across \\nadministrations, both Republican and Democratic, have warned that \\nclimate change acts as a ``threat multiplier,'' increasing global \\ninstability and weakening fragile States as climate change leads to \\nmore extreme weather events and scarcer food and water resources.\\n  In many ways, these findings echo themes about climate change that we \\nalready know--that it is already happening, that it continues to get \\nworse, that it is going to cost us dearly, and that we can do something \\nabout it. It is that last point that I want to focus on. We can do \\nsomething to stop the disastrous impacts of climate change, so long as \\nwe recognize it and work together in a bipartisan way to develop, take \\nup, debate, and pass meaningful legislation that can make a difference.\\n  Democrats have a broad range of bold and new policy proposals and of \\ntested and fully developed policy proposals to address climate change. \\nMany of them are bipartisan.\\n  I wanted to come to the floor today to talk through 4 different bills \\nthat I have cosponsored--some that are relatively new and some \\nconsidered across several Congresses--that are positive, constructive \\nsteps forward we can take to address climate change.\\n  The first, and probably my oldest bill in this field, is called the \\nMLP Parity Act--a catchy name, I know. It has five Republican \\ncolleagues who have cosponsored it now over three Congresses. This bill \\nexpands to renewable forms of energy, to carbon capture and \\nsequestration, and to renewable and so-called clean energy a popular \\nand long-established tax tool for financing energy projects that the \\noil and gas and pipeline sectors have enjoyed for decades. It would \\nlevel the playing field. It would stop picking winners and losers in \\nterms of energy tax policy. It would be, literally, an ``all of the \\nabove'' energy financing strategy. If enacted, it would be the first \\npermanent change for the financing of clean energy projects in the U.S. \\nTax Code--potentially, worth billions of new private investment in \\nrenewable forms of energy.\\n  It is also cosponsored by the Republican chair of the Energy \\nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, the Republican chair of the Banking \\nCommittee, Senator Crapo, and three other colleagues from across the \\ncountry. We have five Democrats and five Republicans. It has had a \\nhearing in front of the Energy Committee and a hearing in front of the \\nFinance Committee in previous Congresses. This is the sort of solid, \\nscored bipartisan bill that would be a meaningful step forward in \\naddressing climate change.\\n  Senator Lindsey Graham and I have introduced the IMPACT for Energy \\nAct to create a private foundation to support cutting-edge energy \\nresearch and technology commercialization. Why would we do this? What \\nam I talking about?\\n  Well, a guy named Bill Gates, one of the greatest inventors and \\ninnovators in American history, wants to deploy private investments and \\nfoundation investments alongside the Department of Energy, in \\npartnership with a lot of other individuals, to significantly \\naccelerate the cutting-edge research being done at our National \\nLaboratories through the Department of Energy.\\n  This is a tool that several other Federal Agencies already have. It \\nis a so-called private foundation that allows them to marry up private \\nsector dollars--foundation dollars--with Federal dollars to leverage \\ngreater impact. This private foundation can go out and raise that \\nadditional money and add it to the energy R&D already being funded by \\nthe Federal Government.\\n  I also want to applaud the hard and bipartisan work of my colleagues, \\nled by Senators Murkowski and Cantwell on the Energy Committee, on a \\ncomprehensive energy bill with a wide range of policy ideas that can \\nmove us forward. It has several components that I contributed and that \\nwould help to address climate change. I very much hope that in this \\nCongress we can finally take up this bipartisan bill and see it signed \\ninto law.\\n  Last, but in some ways most importantly, I want to mention a bill I \\noffered at the end of the last Congress with my friend and former \\ncolleague, the Senator from Arizona, Jeff Flake. Despite our very \\ndifferent ideological, cultural and contextual backgrounds--we are from \\ndifferent States, from different faiths, and from different \\nperspectives on the role of government and society; he is a real \\nconservative, and I am a progressive Democratic--we still managed to \\ncome together and introduce a bill that addresses the cost of ignoring \\nclimate change and the impact it will have on the people in our home \\nStates.\\n  We offered the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. It is a \\ncommonsense bill to achieve significant and sustained emissions \\nreductions and to help to mitigate the worse impacts of climate change. \\nOur bill would accomplish this by using a free-market approach to \\npricing carbon pollution that would spur economic growth and put money \\nback in the pockets of American taxpayers. Similar legislation has been \\nintroduced in the House of Representatives by a bipartisan coalition. I \\nlook forward to reintroducing this bill in this Congress.\\n  The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act should be the \\ncenterpiece of a robust, bipartisan climate agenda because it \\naggressively tackles emissions while optimizing economic growth and \\nincome for working families. We estimate that our bill would reduce \\nemissions by 90 percent by 2050, while creating as many as 2 million \\nnet new jobs in the next decade.\\n  I believe this is an efficient way to use market forces to address \\nthe very real problem of climate change while creating jobs and \\nopportunities for American workers. Frankly, an outright ban on \\nnonrenewable sources would be inefficient and disruptive to workers \\nfrom all sectors, but, in particular, across the building trades and \\nother vital sectors of employment. In contrast, sending a strong market \\nsignal in favor of lower carbon or carbon-neutral energy would spur \\ninvestment and growth in these technologies by the private sector and \\nlead us toward a lower carbon future through competition.\\n\\n\\n  We don't need to choose between clean energy and economic growth or \\nbetween combating climate change and creating jobs. These two goals are \\nnot permanently and mutually exclusive. They can go hand in hand if we \\ncraft the right policies. Still, we cannot move abruptly away from an \\neconomy that relies heavily on fossil fuels without having a real and \\ncoordinated plan for the very people--the millions of Americans--whose \\njobs will ultimately be impacted by that transition.\\n  Fortunately, a gradual transition to a clean energy future can also \\nbe an effective job creator. In 2017, the renewable energy and energy \\nefficiency sectors alone employed 2.8 million Americans. If we place a \\nprice on carbon and then let the market work, we will create jobs \\nacross a wide range of industries, occupations, and geographies.\\n  As we work to deal with the effects of climate change by moving to a \\ncleaner energy and infrastructure economy--an economy that is more \\nresilient--we will need to rely on workers who are already in place in \\nmany of these industries. We will need building trades professionals to \\nconstruct and maintain our new resilient and clean energy \\ninfrastructure. We will need manufacturing workers to build these more \\nenergy-efficient products. We will also need scientists and engineers \\nto help research, develop, design, and deploy these new technologies. \\nThese workers bring real experience and skills to the table, and we \\nmust ensure that these skills translate into new, good jobs and that \\nthe workers in these new jobs are able to organize for fair \\ncompetition, for fair compensation, and for fair work conditions.\\n  We can't tackle climate change alone. The United States is the \\nlargest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, but our emissions have been \\ndeclining in recent years. Meanwhile, China has whirred past us, and \\nChina and India and other countries are rapidly catching up in their \\ncarbon emissions. We need an approach that incentivizes these countries \\nto reduce their emissions as well. The United States is a world leader \\nin science and technology and innovation. We need to develop and \\nadvance new technologies--carbon-neutral technologies like small, \\nmodular nuclear reactors and carbon capture and sequestration--that we \\ncan export. Then we need to find ways to encourage countries like China \\nand India to modernize and industrialize while also reducing their \\nemissions.\\n  There is good work taking place in this area, and there are good \\nsolutions we can act on together. We need to reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions in a serious, thorough, deliberate, and thoughtful way. We \\nneed to be prepared to adapt to the ongoing impacts of climate change. \\nWe need to make sure American workers and families aren't left behind \\nor are burdened by Federal climate policy.\\n  This administration, unfortunately, strikes me as taking us backward. \\nWe are voting on an EPA Administrator in this Chamber who is failing to \\ntake action on climate, even on action that is widely supported by \\nindustry. Our President just proposed a National Security Council \\ninitiative to counter the consensus around climate change and refute \\nthe idea that greenhouse gases are harmful to the environment. I \\nshouldn't even need to say this, but that just isn't how science works.\\n  That is why, here in the Senate, we need to take the opportunity to \\nlead and to have voices from both parties in Congress and in this \\ncountry who want to take bold steps to address the climate. The hard \\npart is going to be squaring these big, bold ideas with political \\nreality. That is hard, but there are ways we can do it. Instead of \\nbeing silent, we should bring this conversation to the forefront. \\nInstead of debating whether climate change is real, we should be \\npassing bipartisan bills, like the ones I have mentioned today, that \\ncan meaningfully address climate change and improve our economy.\\n  Climate change is a serious threat to our economy, to our security, \\nand to our way of life. We need leadership from all parts of our \\nsociety and government to tackle it, and we must do our part in the \\nSenate. I look forward to having conversations across the aisle, to \\nworking together, to identifying real solutions to the challenges \\nbefore us, and to creating new opportunities for America's workers.\\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=863, text=\"  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have often said healthcare is not \\npolitical. It is personal, and there is no part of healthcare that is \\nmore personal than the decision if, when, and under what circumstances \\nto have a child and who decides the medical course of action in a \\nserious medical crisis.\\n  These decisions need to be made by women, their families, and their \\ndoctors. They should not be made by politicians who are more focused on \\ntheir own political advantage rather than medical tragedies facing \\npregnant women at the end of pregnancy who want desperately to have a \\nchild.\\n  Our Republican friends know very well that nobody--and I mean \\nnobody--in this Chamber supports infanticide. No one. In fact, in 2002, \\nCongress voted unanimously--100 Members, including myself--to reaffirm \\nthat it is illegal, period. Suggesting otherwise is insulting and, \\nfrankly, disgusting, and it is beneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate.\\n  How dare the majority pretend to care about the health of women and \\nchildren. If the Republican majority cares about the health of moms and \\ntheir babies, why are you continuing to try to take their healthcare \\naway? The President and the Republican majority have tried again and \\nagain and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\\n  Let me remind you that before the Affordable Care Act, insurance \\ncompanies could, and most of the time did, refuse to cover maternity \\ncare as basic healthcare for women, leaving parents with bills of tens \\nof thousands of dollars for an uncomplicated birth.\\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I was proud to author \\nthe provision requiring maternity care in the Affordable Care Act. I \\nremember the debate. I remember a very specific debate with a former \\ncolleague from Arizona, and I remember Republican efforts to strip that \\nprovision to cover maternity care from the Affordable Care Act. \\nFortunately, they were not successful. Now the administration is \\nlegalizing and offering junk insurance plans that treat being a woman \\nas a preexisting condition again.\\n  One study found that none--none--of the newly approved plans cover \\nmaternity care. Maternity care is not a frill. It is basic healthcare \\nfor women, and if we are seeing more and more of these healthcare plans \\nbeing put on the market, where women assume they are going to be \\ncovered and once again will not be, that is outrageous.\\n  Why aren't we passing a bill to guarantee that prenatal care and \\nmaternity care are covered for moms and babies as essential healthcare \\nin every insurance plan? I assure you, this medical care is essential, \\nand until parts of the Affordable Care Act began to be unwound by the \\nadministration, it was viewed as essential care for every woman.\\n  How dare you pretend to care about the health of women and children \\nwhile voting to dramatically slash Medicaid and healthcare for low-\\nincome working families. When you gut Medicaid, you are keeping moms \\nand babies from getting the healthcare they need. In fact, Medicaid \\nprovided prenatal care and maternity care for 43 percent of American \\nmoms and babies born in 2016--43 percent. Why aren't we voting to \\nstrengthen Medicaid? Why aren't we voting to strengthen Medicaid \\nhealthcare for moms and babies? Why isn't that being brought to the \\nfloor?\\n  A few years ago, the Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill \\nthat I led with Senator Grassley called the Quality Care for Moms and \\nBabies Act. This bill would create a set of maternal and infant quality \\ncare standards in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. \\nThe goal is simple: improving maternal and infant health outcomes. \\nShouldn't we all want to do that?\\n  Let me be clear. We have no uniform quality standards right now \\nacross the country for almost half of the births that occur every year. \\nThe Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act will help\\n\\n\\nmake sure every mom--every mom--gets the best pregnancy care possible \\nand every baby gets a healthy start. Why isn't that a top priority for \\naction in the U.S. Senate, to protect the health of moms and babies?\\n  Let's also be clear. We have a real healthcare crisis that we need to \\naddress in this country. In most of the world, fewer and fewer women \\nare dying from child birth but not in the United States. In fact, our \\nmaternal mortality rate is climbing. More women are dying, and our \\ninfant mortality rate ranks a shameful 32 out of 35 of the world's \\nwealthiest nations. The United States of America is 32 out of 35 \\ncountries--wealthiest countries in the world--in the number of infants \\nthat are dying in birth. That is something we need to have a sense of \\nurgency to act on.\\n  There are a lot of things on healthcare. There are a lot of things to \\nimprove outcomes for children and moms and give them a healthy start \\nand a healthy life that we should be doing right now, as well as \\nstopping the administration from undermining basic healthcare for women \\nand children. It is time to stop the cynical political stunts and start \\nprotecting--really protecting--the health of moms and babies.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=867, text=\"  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am glad to join Senator Stabenow, who \\nwas on the floor just now, to respond to the shameful lies and gross \\nexaggerations that have been claimed by some on the other side of the \\naisle.\\n  Earlier this week, we voted on legislation that some of my colleagues \\nclaimed was needed to outlaw infanticide--the killing of babies. How \\nabsurd. It is, and has always been, illegal to kill any human, \\nincluding infants.\\n  So what was in that legislation we voted on earlier this week? To \\nhonestly discuss the bill, we need to have a factually and medically \\naccurate conversation about abortion.\\n  A healthy fetus becomes potentially able to live outside the womb at \\nabout 24 weeks of pregnancy. Very few abortions occur after that--less \\nthan 1 percent--and generally are performed either because the fetus \\nhas a fatal condition or the pregnant woman's life or health is at \\nsevere risk. These are heartbreaking situations involving very wanted \\npregnancies--hardly the time for the heavy hand of government to reach \\ninto our wombs.\\n  Under this bill, doctors will be required to resuscitate infants born \\nwith fatal conditions, even if the parents did not want these measures \\nthat could prolong their infant's suffering and instead wanted to spend \\nthe limited time they had with their baby comforting their child and \\nholding them close.\\n  How dare anyone pretend to know what care is best for these families \\ninstead of trusting them and their doctors to decide. How dare Congress \\ninterject itself into a decision we have no business deciding for \\nothers. Yet this is exactly what this bill would have done.\\n  I encourage my colleagues to read stories from women who have been \\nspeaking up about their experiences with abortion later in pregnancy. \\nThese stories are usually found on the internet as well as in the \\nnational press, as more women feel under attack and are coming forward \\nto tell their stories. Perhaps, in hearing from these women, my \\ncolleagues will realize what these women need is compassion, not \\ncondemnation.\\n  Stories like that of Dana Weinstein, who bravely told her story to \\nCNN. Years ago, Dana and her husband learned at 31 weeks that their \\ndaughter's brain had a severe defect. Doctors told the couple their \\ndaughter would not be able to suck or swallow and would most likely \\nsuffer from uncontrollable seizures upon birth. They heard what a \\nresuscitation order would entail. They listened to what an existence, \\nshort-lived or otherwise, would look like. They were briefed on hospice \\ncare.\\n  After the diagnosis, the kicks in Dana's belly, which had given her \\nso much joy, became unbearable. She feared her daughter was seizing and \\nmay be suffering. Ultimately, Dana and her husband decided to get an \\nabortion. For this baby they loved, it felt like--in their words--``a \\nmore peaceful path for her passing.''\\n  These are the stories. Compassion and understanding are what is \\nneeded in these instances, but instead of compassion, what my \\ncolleagues have offered this week is inflammatory political rhetoric \\nand shaming and intimidating women and their providers who care for \\nthem in an attempt to score partisan points.\\n  President Trump--never missing an opportunity to score partisan \\npoints--weighed in on Twitter claiming that Senate Democrats ``don't \\nmind executing babies after birth.''\\n  Today former Governor Scott Walker said to a crowd at the \\nConservative Political Action Conference that ``people are taking \\nalready-born babies from the hospital and aborting them there''--a \\ncomment that doesn't even make sense.\\n  Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, chimed in at the \\nsame conference, calling the choice that women like Dana make murder. \\nThese charges are false, incendiary, and this sort of language is \\nintended to incite the Republican Party's base. It emboldens violence \\nagainst abortion providers--violence which nearly doubled from 33 \\nreported death threats or threats of harm in 2016 to 62 in 2017, \\naccording to the National Abortion Federation.\\n  The hard truth is, the Republican Party hurts women. One of the ways \\nthey are doing this is by working as hard as they can to set up \\nbarriers or to eliminate entirely safe and legal abortions wherever \\nthey can.\\n  They demonize women who face the heartbreaking situation of needing \\nan abortion later in pregnancy, oftentimes for medical reasons.\\n  They want to cut off crucial healthcare dollars to providers who even \\ndiscuss abortion with patients. This is a gag rule that this \\nadministration is seeking to impose.\\n  They create loopholes to allow businesses to exclude coverage for \\ncontraception for workers, and to make sure that these and all of their \\nother efforts stick, they pack the Federal courts with a line of \\naggressively anti-choice judges to uphold Federal Agency actions and \\nState laws restricting abortion access.\\n  Doing the bidding of these rightwing ideologue supporters like the \\nFederalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, Donald Trump has sent \\nus judicial nominee after nominee with records of attacking a woman's \\nright to choose as laid out in the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. \\nWade and restated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\\n  These nominees come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I \\nserve, and parrot the line provided for them by the Trump \\nadministration. When asked if they will respect precedent and uphold \\nRoe v. Wade, they say they will ``follow the law.'' Then, when they get \\nconfirmed, they are in a position, with their lifetime appointments, to \\ndo exactly the opposite.\\n  The prime and most dangerous example of this kind of bait and switch \\nis Brett Kavanaugh--a notoriously rightwing political lawyer appointed \\nby George W. Bush to the second highest court in the United States--the \\nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\\n  Kavanaugh was not even on Donald Trump's original so-called short \\nlist of possible Supreme Court nominees--not the list released before \\nthe 2016 election and not the first list released thereafter. No, \\nKavanaugh only found a place on that list after he wrote a harsh \\ndissent in a case involving a young refugee's right to an abortion.\\n  A minor, then 17 years old, was being kept in the custody of the \\nDepartment of Health and Human Services because she had entered the \\nUnited States without documentation. Where she was held in Texas, in \\norder to access abortion services, a minor must have parental consent \\nor receive permission from the judge. This is called a judicial \\nbypass--to proceed without that parental consent.\\n  In this case, called Garza v. Hargan, the young woman did go through \\nthe process of going to court and receiving a judicial bypass. She had \\npeople willing and able to transport her and to\\n\\n\\npay for the health services she needed, but the radical Trump appointee \\nin charge, well known for his anti-abortion views, decided it would be \\nin her best interest to find adult sponsors for her first, presumably \\nto help her make a decision, but the Texas court had already decided \\nshe could make her own decision, and she did.\\n  She challenged the Trump appointee and his Agency, and ultimately a \\nmajority of the DC Circuit agreed with her that she had the legal right \\nto an abortion and the Federal Government could not delay any further.\\n  Brett Kavanaugh, sitting on that circuit, disagreed and wrote a \\ndissent, which must have captured the attention of those in charge of \\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court short list because not long after his name \\nappeared on that list.\\n  What did he write to earn his place on the list and eventually a \\nnomination to the U.S. Supreme Court? He wrote a dissenting opinion \\nthat falsely characterized the Garza case as one about parental \\nconsent, which we know was not so because a judicial bypass was already \\nin place.\\n  He wrote the dissent using the code words of the extreme anti-choice \\nand anti-women wing of the Republican Party. He accused the majority on \\nthat court of creating ``a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in \\nU.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.'' He \\nwas wrong. There was no new right being created.\\n  He falsely claimed that by permitting the abortion ``[t]he majority's \\ndecision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court's abortion \\njurisprudence.'' He was wrong again. The majority decision was correct \\nunder Roe v. Wade.\\n  He wrote it was not an undue burden for this young woman to be \\nprevented from getting an abortion until a sponsor family could be \\nfound for her. This was not even a legal argument, but he based his \\ndissent on it. That is the dissent that moved Brett Kavanaugh to the \\nhead of the line on the short list for a nomination to the U.S. Supreme \\nCourt, where he sits.\\n  So when he came to the Judiciary Committee for a hearing, some \\nSenators--myself included--were rightly skeptical that he would respect \\nprecedent if confirmed. At his hearing, Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein \\nasked Judge Kavanaugh about Roe v. Wade and its status as settled \\nprecedent. He testified that Roe was ``settled as a precedent of the \\nSupreme Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.''\\n  He further went on: ``Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirms Roe and \\ndid so by considering the stare decisis factors. So Casey now becomes a \\nprecedent on precedent.''\\n  It sure sounds like someone who will apply the precedents of Roe and \\nCasey and others who rely on them, doesn't it? That is not so.\\n  The very first opportunity he got, Brett Kavanaugh, as Supreme Court \\nJustice, voted against following precedent. Not 4 months after his \\nconfirmation, Justice Kavanaugh voted in the minority in a Supreme \\nCourt case called June Medical Services v. Gee to allow a restrictive, \\nanti-abortion law in Louisiana to take effect.\\n  This law would have so restricted access to abortion that only one \\nprovider would have been left in the entire State of Louisiana of 4.7 \\nmillion people. Even Chief Justice Roberts voted with the majority to \\nblock the law. That is because it was clear from recent precedent in \\nWhole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt that such restrictions don't meet \\nconstitutional standards.\\n  Justice Kavanaugh's cavalier attitude to the burden that he would put \\non a woman's ability to exercise their constitutional right is no \\nsurprise. His callous disregard for the way unwanted pregnancies can \\nchange the lives of women and children is not unexpected, and his \\nwillingness to hew to the party line of his supporters and ignore the \\nassurances he gave the Senate is simply par for the course with Trump \\njudicial nominees. This is what they do. It is an abuse of power, and \\nwomen across the country are paying for it.\\n  Why do my colleagues across the aisle use this Chamber, time and \\nagain, to bring forward political shams that shame and retraumatize \\nwomen who face profoundly heartbreaking situations? The will of over \\nhalf of this country is 67 percent of Americans support Roe v. Wade and \\naccess to safe and legal abortion. Sixty-seven percent of Americans \\nsupport a woman's right to choose.\\n  How is it that Republicans continue to bring forward bill after bill \\nand amendment after amendment that goes against a constitutionally \\nprotected right of women--of women? This is why I say Republicans hurt \\nwomen.\\n  I am proud of the vote I cast in opposition to the sham bill we voted \\non this week. My vote was rooted in fact and understanding about what \\nan abortion in later pregnancy actually means. It was rooted in the \\nunderstanding that when faced with these difficult situations, these \\ndecisions are best left to a woman and her doctor. These decisions \\nshould not rest with the U.S. Senate.\\n  My vote was cast with a clear understanding that if unchecked or \\nunchallenged, this administration and this Senate will continue to \\nassault a woman's right to choose and chip away at it bit by bit, where \\nit will end up being a nullity, and that is what they want.\\n  I will continue to stand in opposition to attacks that seek to limit \\nthe personal freedom of women across the country and what would be more \\nof a personal freedom for a woman than to exercise control over her own \\nbody?\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care', 'Technology', 'Abortion', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=871, text=\"  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss why I voted in \\nopposition to the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler for the position of \\nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n  Clean air and clean water are not only vital to our public health; \\nthey are at the very heart of our economy. Nowhere is that more \\napparent than in my home State of Michigan, where we are blessed to be \\nsurrounded by the Great Lakes, a source of drinking water for more than \\n40 million people and the lifeblood of our State's multibillion-dollar \\nfishing, shipping, and tourism industries. That is why I spent my \\nentire career in public service fighting to protect our environment.\\n  In the Michigan State Senate, I worked to ban oil drilling under the \\nGreat Lakes to preserve our most precious source of drinking water. \\nWhen I represented the city of Detroit in the House of Representatives, \\nI fought to end harmful air pollution coming from piles of petcoke that \\nleft homes coated in dust while being breathed into the lungs of \\nresidents.\\n  In my first term in Congress, I supported landmark climate change \\nlegislation that sought to drastically reduce deadly greenhouse gas \\nemissions that are continuing to warm our planet at an unsustainable \\nrate. In the U.S. Senate, I led the charge to protect the Great Lakes \\nfrom pipeline spills and pressured industry to cut down their deadly \\nsulfur-dioxide emissions that give Michigan communities some of the \\nhighest rates of asthma anywhere in the country.\\n  I have championed these vital efforts because protecting our \\nenvironment in Michigan is in the best interest of everyone, and I will \\nnever let up on that fight. There is so much more work to do and even \\nmore pressing challenges ahead of us. We cannot afford to turn back the \\nclock on clean energy innovation or refuse to address climate change, \\nand that is, unfortunately, what we can expect from the EPA now that \\nAndrew Wheeler has been confirmed. His entire career has been devoted \\nto undermining public health and environmental protections.\\n  As Acting EPA Administrator, he is personally responsible for the \\nmost significant efforts to roll back our Nation's bedrock \\nenvironmental laws in the Agency's history. He oversaw the proposed \\nrollback of Clean Water Act protections that safeguard drinking water \\nfor tens of millions of people. He is leading efforts to weaken \\nstandards on the largest sources of greenhouse gases and to reduce \\nprotections against climate change. When he was a Senate staffer, he \\ndrafted the so-called ``Clear\\n\\n\\nSkies Act,'' which was directly intended to undermine the Clean Air \\nAct.\\n  As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Wheeler represented a company that \\ndidn't just knowingly violate environmental laws but consistently put \\nits own employees' safety at risk by undermining basic protections for \\ncoal miners. He has even undermined the widely supported mercury and \\nair toxics standards. These commonsense standards would have protected \\npeople, particularly children, from a well-known neurotoxin that \\nimpairs fetal brain development and reduces children's ability to \\nlearn.\\n  Every single one of these actions has a direct bearing on human lives \\nand has put people at risk. In Michigan we have witnessed firsthand the \\nvisceral and painful human costs when public leaders fail to keep our \\ndrinking water and our air quality safe. Just ask the people of Flint \\nwhom they would want to have in charge of protecting their drinking \\nwater. I can tell you it certainly is not Andrew Wheeler. The city, the \\nState, and the EPA all contributed to the crisis that poisoned \\nthousands of children through lead exposure, and now those children \\nwill suffer lasting consequences for the rest of their lives.\\n  While I am proud that the Senate was able to come together to provide \\ninitial Federal funding to help Flint replace its lead pipes, the \\ncommunity needs continued support going forward. I am committed to \\ndoing everything in my power to ensure that the people of Flint are \\nmade whole, and that included my opposing this nomination. We cannot \\nallow the failures of leadership that led to Flint's devastating crisis \\never be repeated again.\\n  The people of Michigan and of every State deserve to know that their \\nair is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink. Yet \\ncommunities across my State and around the country are facing another \\nemerging drinking water crisis. This time it is from toxic fluorinated \\nchemicals, known as PFAS, that are currently unregulated by the EPA. \\nRigorous testing has found that 1 out of every 10 water systems in my \\nState has unacceptable high rates of PFAS chemicals. Families across \\nthe State have been exposed to these dangerous chemicals that have been \\nlinked to cancer, thyroid and heart problems, and even autoimmune \\nissues. But under Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has failed to take \\naggressive action to list PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste and to \\nestablish strong and forcible limits to protect drinking water and to \\nlimit exposure to these toxic substances.\\n  While I work to bring Senate action to this issue through legislation \\nand hearings, the Wheeler-led EPA thinks action can wait. Michigan \\nfamilies certainly deserve better. My constituents are understandably \\nconcerned about their drinking water, and they are rightfully skeptical \\nabout who will be at the helm of the Agency charged with keeping water \\nsafe.\\n  Since Wheeler has failed to exercise the leadership needed to address \\nthe environmental concerns we face on a national level, it is clear \\nthat he is completely unprepared to lead the Agency charged with \\ntackling the global crisis of climate change. We must confront climate \\nchange. I have been advocating for action since before I ran for \\nCongress. It is an issue impacting our economy, our health, our safety, \\nand our national security. I am committed to continuing to work with my \\ncolleagues to find innovative and achievable solutions to address \\nclimate change, but we also need a leader at the EPA who can find \\ncommonsense ways to address this very serious threat, to protect our \\nenvironment, and to ensure that our country can remain economically \\ncompetitive. We need a leader who will fight to protect the people and \\nthe interests of my State. Given his abysmal record, it is clear that \\nAndrew Wheeler isn't the right person for the job, and that is why I \\nvoted against his confirmation.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Abortion', 'Health Care', 'Energy & Oil & Environment'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=875, text=\"  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, as you know, I try to come down to the \\nfloor every week to talk about someone in my State who is making a big \\ndifference in Alaska, a big difference in their country, and a big \\ndifference in what I believe is the best State in this country. That is \\njust my opinion. I am sure the Presiding Officer thinks his State is \\nthe best in the country, but that is why we are all here in the Senate.\\n  Of course, Alaska is beautiful, particularly now as the snow is on \\nthe ground and the Sun is out. It is back out and high in the sky. It \\nis also nearly time for the Iditarod--the last great race--something, I \\nam sure, Senator Murkowski and I will be talking about on the floor in \\nthe coming weeks. It kicks off this weekend.\\n  We know it is a beautiful and amazing State, but what really makes \\nAlaska such a great place are the people--the people who work \\ntirelessly for causes they believe in.\\n  Many people don't know this, but Alaska is also incredibly diverse. \\nIn fact, Anchorage--my hometown and the State's largest city--is home \\nto the country's three most diverse census tracks, racially and in \\nterms of nationalities. By the way, the fourth is Queens, NY.\\n  I will just give you an example. Last week, we had this great event \\ncalled Bridge Builders. It was in Anchorage. There were all of these \\ndifferent ethnic communities in Anchorage coming together. I spent a \\nlot of time there on Saturday.\\n  We are very proud of our diversity. We are proud that more than 100 \\nlanguages are spoken in our schools. Think about that if you want to \\ntalk about diversity. We are proud of the foods and the cultural \\nevents. We are proud of the unique tapestry that makes up Alaska.\\n  We are very proud of our history, and we are also blessed to have \\npeople who work diligently for all of us to keep history alive. I can \\nthink of no better way to cap off Black History Month than to recognize \\nsomeone who, for years, has been fiercely determined to unearth a very \\nimportant part of Alaska's history--actually, a very important part of \\nAmerica's history--one that transpired in my State but that greatly \\ninfluenced our Nation during a very critical time.\\n  I want to introduce you to Ms. Jean Pollard. She is our Alaskan of \\nthe Week. Jean has brought back the story of the African-American Army \\nEngineers of the 93rd, 95th, and 97th regiments who were in the U.S. \\nArmy during World War II and stationed in Alaska during World War II.\\n  More than 3,000 of these brave soldiers were integral in Alaska in \\nbuilding what we call the Alcan Highway--the Alaska-Canada Highway--one \\nof the 20th century's greatest engineering feats.\\n  Let me tell you about Ms. Pollard. Now a retired schoolteacher, she \\ngrew up in Georgia. When she was a teenager, her father, who was in the \\nArmy, got transferred to Alaska. Like all Alaskan students--like our \\ngood students, our pages in the Senate--she took a class on her State's \\nhistory--Alaska history--in high school.\\n  During the class, she learned about how the Army built the Alcan \\nHighway in 1942 to help defend Alaska and America from invasion by \\nJapan. A lot of people don't know this. Yes, Alaska was invaded and \\noccupied by the Japanese military during World War II in the Aleutian \\nIslands. I am going to talk about that a little bit more.\\n  She learned about this in high school. It was a good story, but the \\nmost important element she was taught in high school was actually left \\nout. The highway was only able to be finished because of the more than \\n3,000 African-American soldiers who built it.\\n  So after getting a master's degree in education and a minor in \\nhistory and after being a teacher for decades, Ms. Pollard only learned \\nthe entire story herself when she was sitting home one Friday night \\nwatching a PBS documentary about the building of this incredible \\nhighway.\\n\\n  What did she learn? Again, let's go back in time. It is March 1942, 3 \\nmonths after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. As the war effort was \\nheating up, construction began on a 1,700-mile-long vital link \\nconnecting the great State of Alaska--it wasn't a State then; it was a \\nterritory--to the lower 48 for the war effort.\\n  Soon a massive mobilization followed--about 10,000 Army troops. Huge\\n\\n\\ntrucks, civil engineers, food, tents, you name it, were deployed to \\nstart building this road.\\n  Then, in June 1942, the Japanese invaded Attu and Kiska Islands in \\nthe Aleutian Islands chain of Alaska, adding a new sense of urgency to \\nthe completion of the road.\\n  These soldiers worked day and night--200 bridges, 800 culverts, \\nthrough some of the most rugged terrain on planet Earth, mountains, \\nrivers, no rest, hard, backbreaking work--and they were able to \\ncomplete this 1,700-mile road that still exists today--some of you may \\nhave driven it--in less than a year.\\n  When the road was being built, the military was still segregated, and \\nAfrican Americans in the Army--much like in the rest of the country--\\nwere treated as second-class citizens. They were assigned to the \\ntoughest jobs on this project, using the worst equipment. In the \\nsummer, it was full of mosquitoes, black flies, mud, and swamps.\\n  Winter comes early in Alaska. According to the historian, Lael \\nMorgan, the winter of 1942 was considered one of the worst winters on \\nrecord since 1906 in terms of how cold it was--and, trust me, it gets \\ncold in Alaska--and how much snow there was.\\n  The Black troops were required to build winter barracks for the White \\nsoldiers, while the African-American troops lived in tents. When the \\nsnow fell, they couldn't get supplies, and some nearly starved to \\ndeath, Lael wrote. It is reported that some even succumbed to injuries \\ndue to the cold--fatalities due to the cold.\\n  They did so much of the hard work. However, the contribution of these \\ngreat African-American soldiers and heroes were completely almost \\nscrubbed from all of the history books. Nobody that Ms. Pollard spoke \\nto--social studies teachers or history professors--knew anything about \\nthis history.\\n  In Ms. Pollard's words: ``They stole that history.'' The history \\nbooks wouldn't write it. It was wrong, and she knew she had to make it \\nright so she went to work.\\n  As a teacher herself and a lifelong learner, she knew that bringing \\nthe story to the school system was key to keeping our history alive--\\naccurate history. Eventually, she called the historian I spoke about, \\nLael Morgan--a former Alaskan who was then living in Maine and happened \\nto be featured in that documentary that Ms. Pollard watched on that \\nFriday evening.\\n  Lael decided to help in a big way. Incredibly, a year later, she sold \\nher house in Maine and headed up the Alcan Highway to Alaska. Together, \\nand with the help of a team of others Ms. Pollard recruited, they \\namassed enough material to give to the school system to set the history \\nright.\\n  Now schools across Alaska are putting this story--this real story--\\ninto their curriculum, and now she is trying to get it required as part \\nof a course that the university students in Alaska who are studying \\neducation have to take.\\n  She and her team put calls out across the internet for anyone who was \\ninvolved in or had a relative involved in building the highway. She was \\nable to track down three members of the African-American Army Engineers \\nwho were still alive. She flew to interview one of the soldiers who was \\n100 years old. Another one, who lives in Louisiana, traveled to Alaska \\nin 2017 for the 75th anniversary of the highway's completion.\\n  Recently, Ms. Pollard mentioned the names of the soldiers she spoke \\nto back then. There was a soldier from Virginia, SGT Reginald Beverly, \\nwho, unfortunately, has now passed away. The soldier in Louisiana who \\ncame to Alaska in 2017 is Private Leonard Larkins. He has 10 children. \\nThe Alaska Highway Project will be bringing him and his three sons back \\nto Alaska on August 3 to help him celebrate his 99th birthday.\\n  I am in the process of drafting a Senate resolution to recognize all \\nof the members of the African-American Army Engineers who helped build \\nthe Alcan Highway, which was so critical to protecting our Nation and \\nAlaska.\\n  Ms. Pollard describes herself as feisty. Others might describe her as \\nfiercely determined. When the Alaska State Legislature, at her urging, \\npassed a resolution commemorating these African-American soldiers who \\nbuilt one of the greatest engineering highways in the world, she was \\nsitting behind some of the State legislators.\\n  She heard one whisper to another: Have you met this Jean Pollard?\\n  The other said: Yes, she calls me several times a day about this \\nbill.\\n  Julie and I were just with Ms. Pollard this past weekend, as I \\nmentioned, at the Bridge Builder event in Anchorage--my wife Julie and \\nI. She is very passionate, very persuasive, and we are very proud of \\nher.\\n  Ms. Pollard and the team that created the Alaska Highway Memorial \\nProject are on another mission to erect a memorial in a park in \\nAnchorage. They have the design, and they certainly have the will with \\nher driving it, and I have no doubt they will get it done to \\nmemorialize this great engineering feat by American heroes who were not \\ntreated well by their country.\\n  Like the story of how Ms. Pollard brought important history back to \\nour State, the story of building the Alcan and of the civil rights in \\nthe military also has an uplifting message.\\n  On October 25, 1942, less than 8 months after they started, two \\nsoldiers, one African American and one White, shook hands after \\ncompleting this highway. Six years later, President Harry S. Truman \\nordered the Army desegregated, 16 years before the passage of the Civil \\nRights Act. Many historians now cite the work and the experience on \\nthis Alcan Highway project, and the African-American soldiers and White \\nsoldiers working together on a really difficult challenge, as also \\nhelping make that possible--civil rights, 16 years later.\\n  The Federal Highway Administration calls the Alcan Highway the road \\nto civil rights. Isn't that a great depiction?\\n  So, Ms. Pollard, thank you and your team for bringing that history \\nback to us. I am proud to have talked a little bit about that important \\nhistory for Alaska and America on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \\nCongratulations for being our Alaskan of the Week.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Civil Rights', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=879, text=\"  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, President Trump has been in Vietnam \\nthis week, meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. I applaud \\nthe President for his efforts to improve the U.S. relationship with \\nNorth Korea.\\n  There is not a more difficult relationship anywhere in the world at \\nthis time than that relationship. But I am glad he chose not to seek a \\ndeal just for the sake of a deal.\\n  As he returns from his summit with the North Korean leader and turns \\nhis attention back home, I want to make a respectful suggestion, and \\nthat is this: that President Trump ask his lawyers to take a second \\nlook at existing funding authorities that the President has to consider \\nconstruction of the 234 miles of border wall that do not require a \\nformal declaration of a national emergency.\\n  I support what the President wants to do on border security, but I do \\nnot support the way he has been advised to do it. It is unnecessary and \\nunwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis about \\nseparation of powers when the President already has congressional \\nfunding authority to build the 234 miles of border wall that he \\nrequested in his January 6 letter to the Senate.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record \\nfollowing my remarks the text of the President's January 6 letter to \\nthe Senate Appropriations Committee.\\n  Mr. President, there has never been an instance in which a President \\nof the United States has asked for funding, Congress has refused it, \\nand the President has then used the National Emergency Act to justify \\nspending the money anyway.\\n  If President Trump can build a wall when Congress has refused to \\nprovide the funding, then the next President can declare a national \\nemergency and tear the wall down or declare climate change an emergency \\nand stop oil exports and offshore drilling. There is no limit to the \\nimagination of what the next leftwing President could do to harm our \\ncountry with this precedent.\\n  After an American revolution against a King, our Founders chose not \\nto create a Chief Executive who could tax the people and spend their \\nmoney any way he chose. The Constitution gave that responsibility \\nexclusively to a Congress elected by the people, and every one of us \\nU.S. Senators has taken an oath to support that Constitution.\\n  Separation of powers is a crucial constitutional imperative that goes \\nto the very heart of our freedom.\\n  I don't know how the late Justice Antonin Scalia would have decided a \\ncase on this matter, but I do know what he said about separation of \\npowers, and this was what Justice Scalia said:\\n\\n       Every tin horn dictator in the world today . . . has a Bill \\n     of Rights. That's not what makes us free. . . . What has made \\n     us free is our Constitution. . . . The word ``constitution'' \\n     . . . means structure. That's why . . . the framers debated \\n     not the Bill of Rights . . . but rather the structure of the \\n     federal government. The genius of the American constitutional \\n     system is the dispersal of power. Once power is centralized \\n     in one person, or one part [of our government], a Bill of \\n     Rights is just words on paper.\\n\\n  That was Justice Scalia.\\n  The President can avoid this dangerous precedent completely. He can \\nuse the congressional funding authority he already has to build the 234 \\nmiles of wall that he asked Congress to approve in the January 6 letter \\nthat I submitted for the Record.\\n  Here is how this would work. On January 6 of this year--last month--\\nin his letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the President \\nrequested $5.7 billion to build 234 miles of new physical barrier on \\nthe southern border.\\n  Then, on February 14, a couple of weeks ago, Congress passed the \\nHomeland Security appropriations bill, which provided $1.375 billion to \\nbuild 55 miles that the President had asked for.\\n  On February 15, the day he signed the Homeland Security \\nappropriations bill, President Trump announced that he would use two \\nadditional sources of funds that had already been approved by Congress, \\nwhich could be used to fund the border wall.\\n  The first was $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. The \\nsecond was up to $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense accounts \\nto support counterdrug activities and to block drug-smuggling corridors \\nacross international boundaries.\\n  The President is authorized to do this because of a provision in law \\nthat allows him to transfer up to $4 billion among the accounts of the \\nDepartment of Defense. That is $4 billion in a Department of Defense \\nbudget of about $600 billion.\\n  These three sources of funding that I just mentioned add up to about \\n$4.5 billion or $1.2 billion less than the $5.7 billion that the \\nPresident requested in his January 6 letter.\\n  So where does he get the rest of the money? He can get it by \\ntransferring $3.7 billion instead of $2.5 billion from the Department \\nof Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities. Then the \\nPresident would be able to build the 234 miles of wall he requested on \\nJanuary 6, and he would not need to declare a national emergency.\\n  To be specific, this means the President would use $1.375 billion \\nfrom the Homeland Security appropriations bill plus $601 million from \\nthe Treasury Forfeiture Fund plus $3.7 billion from the Department of \\nDefense accounts to support counterdrug activities, which would add up \\nto equal his full $5.7 billion request to build 234 miles of border \\nwall.\\n  If my analysis is incorrect, I hope that the President's lawyers will \\ntell me.\\n  Using funds already approved by Congress avoids the constitutional \\ncrisis of separation of powers. Using funds already approved by \\nCongress avoids establishing a dangerous precedent, which could be \\nmisused by subsequent Presidents. Using funds already approved by \\nCongress avoids taking money from military construction projects \\nspecifically approved by Congress for such activities as military\\n\\n\\nbarracks and hospitals. And using funds already approved by Congress \\navoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely that \\nthe full 234 miles are ever built.\\n  It may be a couple of weeks before the Senate votes on a resolution \\nregarding the national emergency declaration, so we don't know yet \\nexactly what we will be voting on. There is time for the President's \\nlawyers to take another look and determine whether we can both build \\nthe 234 miles of border wall that the President has asked for and avoid \\nthis dangerous precedent. Then the Senate could both support the \\nPresident's border request and be faithful to our oath to support a \\nConstitution that creates separation of powers as a crucial check on \\nExecutive power that goes to the very heart of our freedom.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the \\nPresident's national emergency declaration.\\n  First and foremost, I support President Trump, and I support the \\nwall. Walls work to protect our security, combat human trafficking, \\nstop the flow of drugs, and encourage legal immigration.\\n  Democrats have pushed for zero wall money, open borders, and \\nabolishing ICE. These policies make our Nation vulnerable and threaten \\nour security, and it is a tragedy.\\n  So I don't blame the President for proposing extreme measures to \\nrespond to their extreme policies and tactics. However, yesterday, I \\nmade the difficult decision to disapprove of this type of unilateral \\nexecutive action, just as I could not approve any such unilateral \\naction by any President.\\n  I am 100 percent with President Trump for building the wall, but the \\nemergency declaration only maintains the status quo. Securing our \\nborder is fundamental to who we are as a sovereign nation, and that is \\nwhy I voted over a dozen times for stronger border security, including \\n$25 billion for the wall last year.\\n\\n\\n  Unfortunately, as the President recognized, himself, this national \\nemergency could be tied up in the courts for years with no guarantee \\nthat judges will rule in favor of the wall to be built. It is Congress' \\njob to provide the resources our Nation needs to keep us safe, and I am \\nconcerned that if this is tied up in the courts, we will be stuck with \\nthe status quo of no wall and a border that isn't secure.\\n  My vote to disapprove of this unilateral executive action had nothing \\nto do with the merits or need to build President Trump's wall; it was \\nabout our Constitution and this body's exclusive Article I powers to \\nmake laws and use the power of the purse.\\n  I spoke out strongly when President Obama said that if Congress \\ndidn't act, he would use the pen and the phone, and then he proceeded \\nto act alone on DACA and act alone in reappropriating money within \\nObamaCare and regulating every mud puddle in America.\\n  Remember, President Obama initially said he couldn't act alone on \\nDACA because he wasn't a king or an emperor. After a robust debate in \\nCongress, he flip-flopped and took executive action. His executive \\naction took away Congress' authority to act, and DACA still isn't \\nsolved.\\n  These unilateral actions by President Obama put more power in the \\nhands of unelected people sitting in cubicles in Washington, D.C., and \\nthey turned elected Representatives into elected bystanders. When \\nRepresentatives become irrelevant, citizens become irrelevant, and we \\nthe people are powerless against faceless, unelected bureaucrats.\\n  Unilateral executive actions set bad precedent. If it is okay for the \\nexecutive branch to act alone after the legislative branch doesn't \\nreach an agreement, where does that take us?\\n  Governor Jay Inslee already has said that he would be willing to \\ndeclare a national emergency on climate change allowing for drastic \\nFederal action that would never have to be approved by Congress.\\n  What if, without any congressional approval, a future President used \\na national emergency to take money from our VA clinics, Fairchild Air \\nForce Base, or force management at the Colville National Forest to \\nforce a Green New Deal on the American people?\\n  Whether it is at the border or upholding the separation of powers in \\nour Constitution, we, conservative Republicans, must be consistent \\nabout being the party for the rule of law. It is those principles that \\ndefine us.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker Pelosi: I am 100 percent with Trump on \\nthe wall. I am also 100 percent with the Constitution. As \\nRepresentatives of the people, it is our call to put aside any personal \\nambition or partisan divides so that the people are protected.\\n  This isn't about political parties, personalities, or power. It never \\nhas been. It is about making sure that the promise of America is never \\nbreached and knowing that the only ones who can preserve it are we the \\npeople.

Mr. Desmond has put his legal expertise to \\nwork through years of public service, including at the Department of \\nJustice Tax Division and at the Department of the Treasury. He has an \\nimpressive private sector background as well.\\n  So listen to this: In the last Congress, the Finance Committee \\nrecommended Mr. Desmond to the full Senate by a vote of 25 to 2. That \\nwas last August. Yet this noncontroversial nominee never got a floor \\nvote and had to be sent back to the White House. Well, Mr. Desmond was \\nrenominated. Earlier this month, our colleagues on the Finance \\nCommittee reported him favorably yet again--26 to 2.\\n  I am sorry my Democratic colleagues required us to file cloture on \\nthis thoroughly noncontroversial nominee.

That is right--the much \\nheralded Green New Deal. Nothing says forward-thinking and fresh ideas \\nquite like borrowing the name of an 80-plus-year-old policy program and \\njust adding the color ``green.''\\n  So what is this thing all about? That turns out to be an interesting \\nquestion. It depends on whom you ask. The Democrats who authored it say \\nit is a massive reorganization and government takeover of our Nation's \\neconomy and our culture. Some have argued it is the only way to stop \\nthe world from ending in about a decade.\\n  This was interesting news, even to many of their fellow Democrats. \\nOur colleague Senator Durbin reacted this way:\\n\\n       I have read it, and I have reread it, and I asked [Senator] \\n     Ed Markey: ``What in the heck is this?''\\n\\n  That was the assistant Democratic leader.\\n  But it looks like, one way or the other, the Democratic Party as a \\nwhole is eager to get behind this great idea.\\n  So what is in it? Here are just a few of the hits in the 16-page \\nresolution the Senate will soon be voting on.\\n\\n\\n  Here is one you will like: ``Upgrading all existing buildings in the \\nUnited States and building new buildings.''\\n  Don't want a Federal bureaucrat to decide how your house should look \\nor what size it should be? Don't want to pay to rebuild the entire \\ndowntown? Don't want to tear down your small business so it can be \\nreplaced by the government? Too bad. These new social planners know \\nbest.\\n  Here is another quote: ``Meeting 100 percent of the power demand in \\nthe United States''--listen to this--without using any American fossil \\nfuels or nuclear power whatsoever.\\n  That is right. It is the War on Coal on steroids. Say goodbye to all \\nof those jobs, and say hello to a new wave of cronyism that would make \\nthe half a billion dollars in taxpayer losses from Solyndra look like \\npocket change. Everything in your garage will have to go too. A lengthy \\nbackground document that this plan's authors have since tried to scrub \\nfrom the internet helpfully explains that a Green New Deal would mean \\n``replac[ing] every combustion engine vehicle.''\\n  How about this one: ``Guaranteeing a job . . . to all people of the \\nUnited States.''\\n  That one is buried on page No. 14--a government-guaranteed job for \\neveryone. That may sound like a good utopian goal, but their handy \\nbackground document makes the real intention known, promising \\n``economic security for all''--listen to this--even for those who are \\n``unwilling to work.''\\n  That is a lot of magic wand-waving, but I have only scratched the \\nsurface. The background document also called for a plan to ``build out \\nhigh-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.'' \\nAs our colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this might be a tough sell \\nin Hawaii or in Puerto Rico or in other places. The Governor of \\nCalifornia just scaled back a high-speed rail project in California \\nbecause, as he put it, it ``would cost too much and, respectfully, take \\ntoo long.'' Even with heavy Federal subsidies, it is billions over \\nbudget and behind schedule.\\n  That document also promised to, magically, ``remove pollution and . . \\n. emissions from manufacturing'' just like that. I wonder why nobody \\nhas thought of that before.\\n  So it is clear what we have here. It is the far left's Santa Claus \\nwish list that is dressed up to look like serious policy.\\n  Bad ideas are nothing new, and silly proposals come and go, but the \\nphilosophies and the ideas behind this textbook socialism are not just \\nfoolish; they are dangerous. Their ascent in the Democratic Party is a \\nreal threat to American prosperity and to working families.\\n  Chairman Barrasso reported that one analysis found that this proposal \\ncould increase the average household's power bills by as much as--\\nlisten to this--$3,800 a year. Another estimate predicted that families \\nwould have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars just to replace \\ncommon household appliances with Washington-approved models.\\n  What about the total cost to the government for this socialist \\nshopping spree? One recent estimate has that pegged at a cool $93 \\ntrillion over the first 10 years--more than the combined GDP of the \\nentire world. Let me say that again. Their plan is predicted to cost \\nmore than the entire economic output of every country on Earth \\ncombined.\\n  Remember what the American people are supposedly getting in return--a \\nsprawling socialist state to rule over us, a host of good jobs and key \\nindustries ripped away, and an end to every energy source that the \\nmiddle class can actually afford. Remember, China has already sailed \\npast the United States in terms of carbon emissions. The far left still \\nwants us to unilaterally disarm our whole economy--lots of pain for us \\nand no meaningful gain in containing global emissions. We will go \\nbankrupt, but at least it will be great for China. I bet they are \\ncheering in the streets.\\n  So the way I see it--the way most Republicans see it--is this \\nproposal is either a brilliant piece of comedy or a disastrous \\nsocialist vision that is totally alien to the United States of America.\\n  What about our Democratic colleagues? Where do they stand?\\n  Recently, I announced that Senators will get to go on record and vote \\nfor or against all of this, but curiously enough, this planned vote was \\nmet with outrage from the very people who were claiming to champion the \\nproposal.\\n  Last night, our colleague from Rhode Island said it was ``truly \\npreposterous'' for me to schedule a vote on the Green New Deal. That is \\nnot exactly a ringing endorsement of a plan the Democrats claim to \\nsupport. He does not seem to be alone in his uneasiness. At one point, \\nthe Speaker of the House dismissed her party's own plan as the ``green \\ndream.'' The senior Senator from California worried publicly the other \\nday that there is no way to pay for it. As I noted, the assistant \\nDemocratic leader summed up a lot of people's thinking when he asked: \\n``What in the heck is this?'' I think a great many Americans all across \\nthe country are asking themselves the very same thing--what the heck is \\nthis?\\n  Before much longer, every Member of this body will have a chance to \\ngo on record, loud and clear. Do our Democratic colleagues really \\nsupport this fantasy novel that is masquerading as public policy? Do \\nthey really want to completely upend Americans' lives to enact some \\ngrand socialist vision? Do they really want this to be their Democratic \\nParty? Well, before long, the Senate will vote, and these questions \\nwill be answered.\\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Technology'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=931, text=\"  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I heard Leader McConnell knocking the \\nGreen New Deal. I would ask the leader--and we are going to keep asking \\nhim and every Republican in this Chamber--what they would do about \\nclimate change, about global warming.\\n  So, Leader McConnell, do you believe that climate change, global \\nwarming, is real? Yes or no.\\n  Second, do you believe that climate change, global warming, is caused \\nby humans?\\n  And, three, do you believe that Congress should take immediate action \\nto deal with the problem?\\n  Until Leader McConnell and his Republican majority answer those \\nquestions, the games they are playing here will have no meaning. This \\nis not a debate. It is a diversion. It is a sham.\\n  Democrats will be introducing a resolution in a few days--shortly--\\nthat says we believe in these three things, and we will be asking our \\nRepublicans if they support or oppose that resolution.\\n  The silence of the Republican majority on climate change is enormous. \\nIs it because the oil industry gives so much money to our Republican \\nfriends? Is it because they are antiscience? What is the reason?\\n  Not a single bill has been brought to the floor to deal with climate \\nchange or global warming in the 5 years Leader McConnell has been the \\nmajority leader. What is your plan, Leader McConnell? What is your \\nanswer? We know what you don't like. What do you like? Anything?\\n\\n\\n                              North Korea\\n\\n  Now, the Trump administration is in the middle of two crucial \\nnegotiations with foreign capitals, the result of which will have \\nramifications for decades.\\n  In Vietnam, President Trump will meet with Chairman Kim to continue \\ndiscussions over the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while at \\nthe same time administration officials continue negotiations with \\nBeijing over a major trade pact. In both instances, President Trump \\nwould have the best chance of having success if he articulated clear \\nobjectives and maintained a hard line until those objectives were \\nachieved.\\n  For a time, that approach--the right approach--seemed to hold sway at \\nthe White House, as sanctions and tariffs brought both North Korea and \\nChina to the negotiating table. Recently, however, President Trump \\nseems headed\\n\\n\\ndown the path of capitulation on both North Korea and China, prepared \\nto trade away our leverage in exchange for flimsy agreements. The \\nPresident can't seem to stick to a policy, even when it is beginning to \\nwork. So eager is he for that quick photo op.\\n  There is an old expression that March comes in like a lion and goes \\nout like a lamb. Well, based on all reports, when it comes to North \\nKorea and China, spring is coming a little early at the White House. \\nPresident Trump, on both China and North Korea, came in like a lion, \\nwith tough rhetoric and hard-line policies, but now President Trump is \\npoised to go out like a lamb, meekly accepting half-baked agreements \\nfrom both capitals for the sheer sake of it.\\n  In North Korea the highest priority of U.S. foreign policy has been \\nthe complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the \\nKorean Peninsula, as well as the cessation of human rights abuses by \\nthe brutal, despotic, and murderous Kim regime. But just this weekend, \\nbefore leaving for Hanoi, President Trump said: ``I don't want to rush \\nanybody; as long as there's no testing, we're happy.'' That is a far \\ncry from the complete denuclearization that he called for in the past, \\nand it signals a dangerous softening of our position before the talks \\neven started.\\n  The irony of ironies is that for all the talk of ``maximum pressure'' \\nand ``fire and fury,'' President Trump's stance on North Korea may wind \\nup far weaker than Hillary Clinton's. I know he doesn't like to hear \\nthat, but the truth is the truth.\\n  President Trump seems more interested in touting his warm \\nrelationship with Chairman Kim as an accomplishment in and of itself. \\nPresident Trump's calling a brutal autocrat a friend on Twitter is no \\nsubstitute for actually achieving something for the American people in \\nHanoi.\\n  I hate to say it, but it would be absolutely incredible and even \\npathetic if President Trump were giving in to North Korea for the sake \\nof a photo op to knock Michael Cohen's hearing from the front page, but \\nif the past behavior of the President is any guide, something like that \\nis, unfortunately, totally conceivable.\\n\\n\\n                                 China\\n\\n  Now, Mr. President, the same situation is playing out in China. After \\nstarting down the right path, press reports indicate that President \\nTrump appears to accept something far short of his initial aims. \\nPresident Trump has already started promoting a ``signing summit'' at \\nMar-a-Lago before an agreement has even been inked. Just imagine how \\nthat undercuts our negotiators--to say already he is going to sign \\nsomething when we are eyeball to eyeball with the Chinese. That is not \\nthe art of the deal. That is the art of capitulation.\\n  As the Times reported this morning, ``Mr. Trump has grown impatient \\nwith the talks, and a consensus is growing in Washington that Mr. Trump \\nwill ultimately accept a weak deal.'' Shame on him if he does.\\n  China is robbing and stealing our family jewels: American industrial \\nknow-how, American information technology, Americans' ability to do \\nthings.\\n  When we are good at it, China doesn't let us in and compete, unless \\nwe give them all of the knowledge of how to do it themselves, and China \\nsteals our intellectual property. Just 2 weeks ago, there was another \\nhacking--and now we are going to capitulate?\\n  What the Times goes on to say is that ``the Chinese have so far \\ndeclined to make concrete commitments to reform their economy that the \\nadministration has demanded''--these are the words of the New York \\nTimes--``including ending China's practice of subsidizing companies, \\nengaging in cyber-theft and forcing American companies to hand over \\nintellectual property to Chinese partners in order to do business \\nthere.''\\n  Even our business community does not want the President to \\ncapitulate. I met with a bunch of them. They want him to stay strong. \\nEveryone wants him to stay strong. Now he is caving.\\n\\n  This President cannot take a policy and pursue it to its end. His \\nattention span is so small, his desire for immediate gratification \\nseems to be so large that the American worker loses. If we capitulate \\nto China, that American worker will lose for decades. That American \\nworker's children will lose.\\n  So I say to President Trump, it would be a momentous failure if you \\nrelent now and don't receive meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable \\ncommitments on structural reforms to China's unfair trade policy. \\nSimply buying more soybeans or buying more materials or planes is not \\ngoing to solve the structural problem, and in a few months China will \\ncontinue to unfairly gain on us--not right.\\n  So, I wonder, where are all the supposed hawks? Where is Secretary \\nPompeo on China and North Korea? Where is Ambassador Bolton? Do they \\nfeel they can argue internally with the President and he overrules them \\nand that is that? What good is it for them to be there? Oh, yes, they \\ncan say: It would have been even worse if we weren't there. That is no \\nway to do policy when either American safety, in regard to North Korea, \\nor American economic prosperity in the future, in regard to China, is \\nat stake.\\n  I believe Ambassador Lighthizer has made a sincere effort to do the \\nright thing on China, but his efforts are constrained by a President \\nwho seems intent on weakening his hand every few weeks. Again, where is \\nBolton? Where is Pompeo? Where are they? They have been hawks on these \\ntwo issues their whole lives. Now they get in the administration; they \\njust go along, when they were among the loudest critics of President \\nObama and President Clinton? Not right. Not good for America.\\n  It just so happens that two of President Trump's signature foreign \\npolicy issues will come to a head at roughly the same time. There are \\nhistoric opportunities here to make America safe by removing nuclear \\nweapons from a rogue regime and to end two decades of rapacious Chinese \\ntrade policy. We can finally put American companies on a level playing \\nfield with our largest competitor. If the President, having brought the \\nChinese to the table with tough sanctions and tariffs, takes 10 percent \\nor 20 percent of what we can get, that would be very bad for this \\ncountry, American workers, and American incomes. As they continue to \\nstay flat or decline, one of the main reasons is unfair trade practices \\nby China. We have to be strong and tough. We can win this fight if we \\ncan stay strong.\\n  The bottom line is this. If over the course of the 1 month President \\nTrump capitulates to both Beijing and Pyongyang, the foreign policy of \\nhis Presidency will be in shambles. It will zig and zag to no real \\naccomplishment. More importantly, the national security and economic \\nsecurity of the American people will greatly suffer as a consequence.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=933, text=\"  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a document later removed from her \\nwebsite, one of the Green New Deal's sponsors had this to say about the \\nGreen New Deal: ``The question isn't how we will pay for it, but what \\nwe will do with our new shared prosperity.''\\n  ``The question isn't how we will pay for it . . .'' That was the \\nquote. That is a pretty staggering statement when you consider that the \\nGreen New Deal plans to upend most of American society as we know it, \\nfrom transportation to healthcare, but I suspect there was a simple \\nreason the Green New Deal authors didn't want to talk about how to pay \\nfor it--because they couldn't figure out how.\\n  This week, one think tank released a first estimate of what the Green \\nNew Deal would cost, and here is the answer: between $51 trillion and \\n$93 trillion over 10 years--between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. \\nThose numbers are so large that they are almost impossible to process.\\n  Just for perspective, consider the fact that the entire Federal \\nbudget for 2019 is less than $5 trillion. That is the entire Federal \\nbudget--defense spending, domestic priorities, Medicare and Medicaid, \\nSocial Security, everything.\\n  The Green New Deal could end up costing $9.3 trillion each year--\\ndouble the current Federal budget--and the government would still have \\nto pay for a lot of other priorities on top of that. That money \\nwouldn't cover defense spending, or Social Security, or a number of \\nother urgent needs.\\n  The Green New Deal would assuredly raise Americans' energy bills, but \\nthat is just a tiny fraction of what Democrats' Green New Deal, which \\ngoes far\\n\\n\\nbeyond mere energy policy, would cost American families. It is \\ndifficult to even imagine the staggering tax hikes that would be \\nrequired to pay for this plan.\\n  This plan would never be paid for just by taxing the well-off. That \\nis always the argument we hear. Taxing every household making more than \\n$200,000 a year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years would leave the \\nDemocrats far short of $93 trillion. Taxing every family making more \\nthan $100,000 a year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years would still \\nleave Democrats far short of $93 trillion. In short, actually \\nimplementing this so-called Green New Deal would involve taking money \\nnot just from the well-off but from working families in this country--\\nand not a little bit of money either.\\n  Ninety-three trillion dollars breaks down to over $600,000 per \\nhousehold. That is over 10 times the median household income in my \\nState of South Dakota.\\n  Should the Democratic Green New Deal come to pass, ordinary Americans \\nwould see incredible tax hikes. Middle-class Americans would see a \\nsubstantial and permanent reduction in their standard of living.\\n  When we talk about Democrats' socialist fantasies, we tend to quickly \\nfasten on the staggering costs of these programs, but it is important \\nto also remember what else they would cost Americans.\\n  Socialism just doesn't come with a staggering pricetag; it also comes \\nwith less freedom, fewer choices, and less control of your own destiny.\\n  Socialized medicine like Medicare for All wouldn't mean just big tax \\nhikes; it would mean giving up your private insurance plan, even if you \\nlike your coverage. It would mean being forced onto the government's \\nhealthcare plan, whether you like it or not. It would mean waiting in \\nlong lines. It would mean long wait times you can't do anything to \\navoid.\\n  The Green New Deal would mean higher electricity bills and higher \\ntaxes, but it would also mean limited transportation choices, including \\nno airplane travel, increased government control over your housing \\noptions, less reliable energy, and the list goes on.\\n  Democrats' socialist fantasies would cost Americans untold amounts of \\nmoney and permanently damage our economy, but the loss of choice and \\nfreedom would cost Americans even more.

      "Pandas(Index=935, text=\"  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you are a student of history, the \\nspeech you just heard is not a new speech. It is a speech that has been \\ngiven repeatedly in the Senate Chamber. It was back in the 1930s, when \\na President named Franklin Delano Roosevelt had an idea, and the idea \\nwas radical at the time. Here was the radical idea: Shouldn't we allow \\npeople, during the course of their work-life, to put a little money \\naway and to invest for their retirement so that when they reach the age \\nof 65, they will have a program called Social Security?\\n  That was considered a radical socialist idea, taking money from \\neveryone to create a positive program to help retirees across America \\nwhen they reach retirement age. It takes away our freedom, they said. \\nWe ought to be able to make our own choices in life. They resisted it, \\nbut, fortunately, they failed and in their failure allowed the creation \\nof the Social Security Program, which is the single most popular \\ngovernment program in America today. Over 95 percent of Americans count \\non Social Security to make sure that when they reach retirement, there \\nis something there to take care of them, but that wasn't the end of the \\nspeech you just heard. It was repeated again in the 1960s because \\nanother Democratic President by the name of Lyndon Baines Johnson came \\nup with a notion that, perhaps, if people are going to live a little \\nlonger and have Social Security, they should also be able to have \\naffordable healthcare. So Lyndon Baines Johnson suggested the creation \\nof Medicare.\\n  What did the critics say about Medicare? Socialism; that you would \\ncollect money from people all across America just to provide for the \\nbenefits to those who are retired; that you would take away our freedom \\nto make our own savings plans for our future by saying we have to pay \\ninto Medicare. It is an attack on our freedom, they said. It is a \\nsocialist idea, they said. Thank goodness they lost in that debate as \\nwell.\\n  What happened, of course, was a creation of a Medicare Program, and \\nwe can see what came about as a result of it, a dramatic increase in \\nthe number of hospitals in America and doctors in America. We started \\ntaking healthcare seriously when it came to senior citizens. What is \\nthe proof in the pudding? Senior citizens started living longer and \\nlonger lives. They were healthier, they were independent, they were \\nstrong because of this so-called socialist program of Medicare.\\n  So if you listened this morning as Republican leaders came to the \\nfloor and decried socialism again, what is their point now? Their point \\nnow is, they believe that if we make a national effort toward dealing \\nwith climate change and global warming, it is socialism. It takes away \\nour freedom.\\n  I would agree with them in this respect. If we do something as a \\nnation, a sensible approach that is moderate, constructive, and \\npositive, it is going to change the future. It is going to take away \\nthe opportunity that some of us will have to leave a planet for our \\nchildren that is uninhabitable.\\n  Does anyone doubt--does anyone doubt--that we are dealing with some \\nchange in the climate that we face around this world? Does anyone doubt \\nthat the scientific evidence, year after year after year, about the \\nincreased temperature of this planet has had a negative impact on the \\nworld we live in--more extreme weather events than we have ever seen, \\ntornadoes in Taylorville, IL, in December?\\n  Listen, I grew up in Illinois. I was awakened many times in the \\nsummer to get down in the basement because there was a tornado warning. \\nMy parents were worried about it. It was part of growing up in the \\nMidwest, part of growing up in Illinois. I don't recall ever going down \\nto the basement around Christmas. It turns out that tornado season in \\nIllinois, and many other places, is now becoming a year-round event and \\nflooding and fires and flooding in the city of Miami. All of these \\nthings are evidence to me that something is going on, and we have the \\nscientific explanation. Greenhouse gas emissions are creating a \\ndifferent environment, warming our planet, changing our weather \\npatterns.\\n  I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last several years and \\nasked one basic question, can anyone name any major political party in \\nthe world today--any major political party in the world today--that, \\nlike the Republican Party of the United States, denies climate change?\\n  I make that open challenge over and over again on the floor and have \\nnever had a Republican come to me and say: No, there is another party \\nsomewhere that takes our position on the issue that climate change is a \\nfallacy and a fiction. I will tell you, though--maybe I am not supposed \\nto repeat this--but one Republican Senator, after I made that challenge \\nover and over again, drew me aside in the elevator, looked in both \\ndirections, and said: I think there is a political party in Australia \\nthat also denies climate change. That is as good as it gets--one more \\nparty somewhere halfway around the world.\\n\\n  When Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, comes to the floor and \\nchallenges the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, with the basic \\nquestions, I believe we have the right to ask for an answer.\\n  To the Republicans, to my friend from South Dakota who just spoke, to \\nSenator McConnell of Kentucky, the first question is this: Do you \\nbelieve that there is such a thing as climate change and global \\nwarming? That is a pretty easy question. The scientists overwhelmingly \\nbelieve it. I do too.\\n  The second question that Senator Schumer has posed to them is this: \\nDo you believe that our human activity has something to do with it? \\nWell, the scientific evidence is overwhelming again. Once we got into \\nthe industrial age and starting spewing all of the smoke and chemicals \\ninto the air, things started warming up on this planet Earth.\\n  The third question that Senator Schumer has posed to the Republicans \\nis basically fundamental, as well: What\\n\\n\\nare you going to do about it? The answer is obvious. For the 4 years \\nthe Republicans have been in control in the Senate, they have done \\nnothing--nothing. Now they have a President who has the United States \\nas the only country in the world--the only Nation on Earth--that has \\nwithdrawn from the Paris accord, which tried to create a global \\nstrategy to deal with climate change.\\n  The President is enthralled by the notion that climate change is a \\nfallacy, a fiction, and so are the Senate Republicans. So any effort to \\naddress this is socialism. Any idea that we should come together as a \\nnation and work toward a planet that our kids can live on is taking \\naway our freedom. Well, we know better.\\n  Under President Obama, we started moving toward more fuel-efficient \\ncars and trucks. A gallon of gas is giving us more mileage because of \\ngovernment policy. Well, I guess it took away the freedom of gas \\nguzzlers, but we can at least say we made a positive step forward, and \\nthis administration is stepping backward, and they are doing it for the \\nfossil fuel industry--for oil and gas and coal interests. They are \\ncoming to the floor and trying to get us into a fight, once again, over \\nsocialism when we talk about government policies that would guide us in \\nthe right direction for the future.\\n\\n\\n                        Prescription Drug Costs\\n\\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to give the first of \\nwhat may turn out to be many speeches on a subject that affects every \\nsingle American. The question is the rising cost of prescription drugs \\nin this country.\\n  The first drug that I wanted to address, I wanted to choose carefully \\nbecause I wanted to choose a drug that really is important to the \\nlargest number of Americans. So I thought to myself, what is the most \\ncommonly used life-or-death drug in America today? There is some debate \\nabout it, but I am going to suggest that it is insulin.\\n  In 1923--almost 100 years ago--researchers were awarded the Nobel \\nPrize for the groundbreaking discovery of insulin to treat diabetes--\\n1923.\\n  The chief scientist in the discovery was Dr. Frederick Banting. He \\nbelieved that insulin should be accessible to everyone. His team sold \\nthe patent to the University of Toronto for $1 so that ``no one could \\nsecure a profitable monopoly'' on the production of insulin. That might \\nseem hard to believe today, with the price of insulin having increased \\nmore than 600 percent over the past two decades.\\n  Take a look at the chart, which maps the increases in price. Eli \\nLilly's blockbuster insulin drug, Humalog, was introduced in 1996 at a \\ncost of $21. By 2019, the cost went up to $329.\\n  Sanofi's Lantus was $35 when it came to the market in 2001. It now \\ncosts $270. The insulin drug, NovoLog, cost $40 in 2001. By 2018, it \\nwent up to $289--for insulin.\\n  How many Americans are affected by this? There are 30 million \\nAmericans who live with type 1 or type 2 diabetes--almost 10 percent of \\nour population. Approximately 7.5 million of them rely on insulin to \\nmanage their blood sugar levels. It is a matter of life and death. Yet \\npatients are suffering because of these dramatic price spikes.\\n  A recent study found that one-quarter of patients who rely on insulin \\nhave been forced to ration their doses due to cost, basically in \\ncontravention of the advice of their doctors.\\n  This is a story that many of us have heard here. Last year, we heard \\nfrom the mother of Alec Raeshawn Smith. He went off his mom's health \\ninsurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, he could remain covered until \\nhe reached the age of 26. He had diabetes. He had coverage for his \\ninsulin until he reached the age of 26. Then he couldn't afford to buy \\nhealth insurance. So when he went off of that insurance, he was faced \\nwith the monthly cost of his insulin out of pocket. That monthly cost \\nwas $1,000.\\n  He managed a little restaurant, and he couldn't come up with $1,000. \\nSo he decided that he would ration his insulin and not take as much as \\nwas required by his doctor, trying to make it last between paychecks. \\nAlec died as a result of that decision.\\n  How is it that in the richest country on Earth, patients are having \\nto ration their insulin or start GoFundMe websites just to survive?\\n  Insulin was a cure found in the 20th century that patients now cannot \\nafford in the 21st century. Pharma's war on patients with diabetes must \\ncome to an end.\\n  Yesterday, there was a hearing, widely televised, where seven or \\neight of the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies faced the music \\nbefore the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley, Senator Wyden, \\nand many others asked questions about the issue I am raising today: \\nWhat is going on? Why are you raising prices so high? There were no \\ngood answers coming from these executives.\\n  Today, I am going to start highlighting on the floor of the Senate \\nthe egregious cases of pharmaceutical greed in the United States.\\n  Years ago, there was a Senator from Wisconsin named William Proxmire. \\nHe was an unusual man. He was far different than most Senators today. \\nHe was the type of fellow who would show up at the University of \\nWisconsin games, passing out cards. That was his style of campaigning. \\nHe didn't spend a lot of money on television and radio.\\n  He really was a grassroots politician, and he was a tenacious fellow. \\nHe started something called the Golden Fleece Award--Proxmire of \\nWisconsin's Golden Fleece Award. Once a month or more, he would come to \\nthe floor and talk about waste--taxpayer waste--in our Federal \\nGovernment. It developed a national reputation.\\n  In deference to Senator Proxmire, whom I had a chance to meet when I \\nwas a college student, I am going to try to follow in his tradition by \\npointing out egregious examples of greed by the pharmaceutical industry \\nin the United States on a regular basis with the Pharma Fleece Award.\\n  My first Pharma Fleece Award is for the pharmaceutical industry's \\nextortion of 7.5 million diabetic patients in America who depend on \\ninsulin. This is a lifesaving product that has been around for almost a \\ncentury.\\n  How can the most common life-and-death drug be so expensive? First, \\nthe United States is an outlier. The same companies I am talking about \\nsell exactly the same drug in other countries around the world for a \\nfraction of the cost.\\n  The United States represents only 15 percent of all of the global \\ninsulin market; yet we generate more than half--more than 50 percent--\\nof Pharma's revenue for this drug.\\n  How can Lantus cost $372 in the United States? The exact same drug \\nmade by the same company costs $46 in France and $67 in Canada. Why? \\nWhy are we paying five, six, and seven times more in the United States \\nfor exactly the same drug? It is because the governments of France and \\nCanada care about the cost, and they say to the company Sanofi, in this \\ncase, that makes Lantus: If you want to sell Lantus in Canada, we are \\nnot going to let you hike the prices and raise them to the high \\nheavens. We are going to keep the prices reasonable so that the people \\nof Canada can afford this lifesaving drug. What do we do in the United \\nStates? Nothing. We let them charge whatever they wish.\\n  How can Lantus cost $372 for Americans, while the same, exact drug \\nfor the French is $46, and just across the border, in Canada, it is \\n$67?\\n  Our problem is that our system doesn't function as a free market. \\nThere is virtually no competition. Three companies control the insulin \\nsupply in America: Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk.\\n  Typically, in a free market, three competitors would lower the \\nprices, wouldn't they? But in America, these three charge as much as \\nthey can and get away with it because they are protected by government-\\ngranted monopolies.\\n  We should reward innovation, we should promote research, and we \\nshould ensure that companies do make a profit for their good work, but \\nabusive manufacturers should not be protected from competition by our \\ngovernment.\\n  Lantus has been on the market since the year 2000. Sanofi has \\nreceived 49 secondary patents on insulin. What does that mean? They \\nhave created a fortress around this lucrative drug for a 37-year \\nmonopoly in offering this drug for sale in America.\\n  Unfortunately, there is no effective deterrent today against Big \\nPharma's greed and price gouging on these and so many other drugs. That \\nis why, earlier this month, I introduced a bill called\\n\\n\\nthe Forcing Limits on Abusive and Tumultuous Prices Act, or FLAT Prices \\nAct. This legislation will discourage and deter the pharmaceutical \\nindustry from raising prices by reducing the government monopoly \\nperiods when they do.\\n  You see, companies are awarded monopoly periods from 5 to 12 years by \\nthe Food and Drug Administration for drug approval beyond the patent \\nprotection. My FLAT Prices Act would reduce this FDA-granted \\nexclusivity period for a drug whose price increases more than 10 \\npercent a year, bringing generic competitors into the marketplace, \\ncreating real competition, and trying to lower prices for Americans.\\n  That brings us to another issue. Today, there remains no generic, no \\nbiosimilar insulin that can be substituted in a pharmacy. Think about \\nit. Almost a century after the discovery of human insulin and even half \\na century after the discovery of synthetic and analog insulin, we still \\ndon't have a generic insulin for sale in America that is affordable.\\n  I will acknowledge that these changes in insulin have improved the \\nquality of life for patients. They have made them safer, more \\neffective, and more convenient, but these changes have delayed the \\ndevelopment of generic substitutes.\\n  There are other reasons the FDA has regulated insulin as a drug \\nrather than as a biologic, placing insulin under a framework with a \\nmuch higher bar than generics to prove they are substitutes. Thanks to \\nthe Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--the Food and Drug Administration is \\nsupposed to be shifting its regulatory process for insulin to enable \\ncopycat versions, known as biosimilars, to be approved quickly. \\nUnfortunately, FDA's plan to implement this law will not bring relief \\nto patients any time soon.\\n  I do believe that the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Dr. \\nGottlieb, truly wants to lower costs and spur competition. I wasn't \\nconvinced when his nomination came up for a vote, but I have had \\nsubsequent conversations with him, and I think he is genuine. I think \\nhe wants to see the prices come down.\\n  However, the Food and Drug Administration's current plan will \\neffectively freeze the approval process for lower cost insulin and \\nforce generic insulin makers who are under review to resubmit their new \\napplications each year.\\n  This creates a 2-year lockup where it is unlikely that any new \\ninsulin competitors will come to market. America's diabetic patients \\ncannot wait.\\n  That is why Senator Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, and I are \\nsending a letter urging the Food and Drug Administration to revise and \\nbring flexibility to this process so we can get the lower cost insulin \\non the market approved sooner.\\n  Two weeks ago, I received a little note from a constituent in Mount \\nVernon, IL. That is downstate, near where my father was born. He wrote \\nthat both he and his daughter had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes \\nin 1997. At that time, their Humalog insulin cost $10. Today, he writes \\nthat the cost is $300 a bottle, and he needs six bottles a month.\\n  His monthly costs have risen from $600 to $1,800. Here is what he \\nsaid in this letter:\\n\\n       At some point, drug companies must be held to account for \\n     the actions they are taking. These cost increases are costing \\n     American citizens to choose between insulin and eating in \\n     many cases. I'm tired of listening to all the excuses. . . . \\n     what is it going to take for Congress to do its job?\\n\\n  I agree with my constituent. Congress needs to step up and demand \\nreal change. The sky-high cost of life-or-death insulin is literally \\nkilling Americans.\\n  My work with Senator Cramer to speed FDA approval of lower cost \\ninsulin and my bill to shorten monopolies for abusive pharma companies \\nare a start. This pharma fleecing of insulin patients across America \\nmust end.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Social Security & Tax Reform', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=939, text=\"  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, maybe the fastest way to put people to \\nsleep is to give a speech on cloture here in the Senate, but I hope \\nthat is not the case, because, as my colleague from Iowa just pointed \\nout, this is an abuse of the Senate rules to do nothing but to obstruct \\nand to slow down President Trump's well-qualified nominees for \\nimportant positions.\\n  This is not about their qualifications. This is not about exercising \\nthe constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. In virtually \\nevery instance in which the clock has been burned to get to an eventual \\nvote, these largely noncontroversial nominees have been confirmed \\noverwhelmingly.\\n  Call it part of the ``Trump derangement'' syndrome or the ``never \\nTrump'' effort. It is very clear to me that rather than take these \\nnominees one at a time, treat them fairly, assess their qualifications, \\nand vote on their nomination, these people are being delayed and denied \\nan opportunity to serve, and many of them have just simply given up \\nbecause of the backlog of nominations. It is unfair to them, it is \\nunfair to this administration, and it is completely an abuse of the \\nSenate rules.\\n  We know that our Democratic colleagues have unnecessarily blocked \\nnominees, put them through the ringer in hearings, and, in one \\nparticular case--the Kavanaugh nomination--engaged in an all-out smear \\ncampaign.\\n  This treatment has grabbed headlines, but the story that doesn't get \\nmuch attention is what I want to talk about now--this practice of \\neating up time on the floor, using every second of the rules to \\nessentially eliminate the possibility that we can take up other \\nbipartisan legislation or consider these nominees on any sort of \\nefficient and effective basis.\\n  As a result of the work, these nominees are being denied an \\nopportunity to serve, the floor is being occupied by nominations that \\nare uncontroversial, and we are unable to get to other important work \\nthat the American people want us to do.\\n  Now, it is true that the Senate is not known for speed, and, more \\noften than not, there is a good reason. When we are appropriating \\ntaxpayer dollars or debating sanctions on hostile governments or \\nnegotiating changes to our healthcare system, speed is not always an \\nasset.\\n  But when it comes to confirming nominees--those who already have had \\na hearing, who aren't controversial, who have already received a vote \\nin committee--the process should be able to move rather quickly and \\nefficiently.\\n  But, as I said, this is part of a concerted effort to undermine the \\nTrump administration, to deny them the appointees necessary for them to \\nconduct the Nation's business, and, in many instances, these are \\nAmbassadors who should be representing the United States of America in \\nforeign countries where it is important we maintain good communication \\nwith those other countries.\\n  Over the last 2 years, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \\nhave forced votes on nominees who in previous years would have sailed \\nthrough the Senate.\\n  Let's look at some of these numbers. You can see how much red there \\nis on this chart--cloture votes in the first Congress. President Trump \\nhad 128 cloture votes, President Obama had 12, President Bush had 4, \\nand President Clinton had 8. What that means is that, for example, in \\nthe Clinton administration, there were 120 nominees who were confirmed \\nwithout the necessity of even going through the procedure of cloture. \\nFrequently, these nominees are either passed by voice vote or unanimous \\nconsent or at some agreed upon time. Even fewer required a cloture vote \\nunder President George W. Bush. There were 12 under President Obama and \\n128 under President Trump. If we were to continue down this same path, \\nwe would not be able to do anything else except consider nominations by \\nthis President, and we still wouldn't get to the end of the list.\\n  Our Democratic colleagues don't want to hold votes on these nominees \\nto support or oppose a nomination; they simply want to waste the \\nSenate's time and to test the patience of the American people. The \\nmajority of these nominees, as I said, aren't controversial. Nearly \\nhalf received the support of 60 or more Senators during the cloture \\nvote, and more than one-third got 70-plus votes.\\n  As I said, the delay and obstruction have led to a long list of \\nvacancies across every Department and Agency. Critical leadership \\npositions have gone unfulfilled while the nominees await confirmation \\nvotes from the Senate. As I said, many have simply given up, unwilling \\nto accept any more disruption in their personal lives in the vain hope \\nthat perhaps someday, somehow, they will get a vote in the Senate. This \\nlist includes Ambassadors, Federal judges, Under Secretaries, Assistant \\nSecretaries, and inspectors general. The list continues to grow while \\nour Democratic colleagues insist on votes that will not change the \\noutcome.\\n  It is one thing to have a nominee whose qualifications are \\ncontroversial or where a debate would enlighten the Members of the \\nSenate on how best to cast their vote, but that is not what is \\nhappening here.\\n  Despite our repeated pleas for Democrats to cooperate, things aren't \\ngoing to change. That is why the rules change we are contemplating is \\nso important. It would expedite the process for many nominees to \\nreceive a vote on the floor. It won't change the number of votes they \\nneed to get confirmed--they will still need to get a majority of \\nvotes--or tilt the scale in their favor in any way; it will simply make \\nsure we are not wasting time that is not being used in order to delay \\nor defeat nominations.\\n  Ironically, we have been told by our Senate colleagues on the other \\nside that if we were to pass a rule limiting the postcloture time to 2 \\nhours and we would start it in 2021, at the end of President Trump's \\ncurrent term of office, they would vote for it. So this is really an \\nunprincipled and nakedly partisan approach, because while they are \\nwilling to do it for the next President--and that could well be a \\nsecond Trump term, or it could well be another President--they won't do \\nit now, which demonstrates the hypocrisy they are exhibiting.\\n  What would happen is, a nominee would get a hearing in front of the \\nappropriate committee. That would be debated, and there would be a vote \\nup or down. If the nominee was passed out of the committee and made \\navailable to come to the floor, the Senate majority leader could still \\nfile a paper asking for a cloture vote. If that was obtained, then the \\npostcloture time would be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours. In the\\n\\n\\nmeantime, there would be an intervening day during which debate would \\noccur. Every Senator would still enjoy the right to vote against any \\nnominee they don't support, but to just burn time for time's sake is an \\nabuse of the Senate rules and needs to stop. It is not just hurting \\nthese nominees; it is not just hurting the Senate; it is hurting the \\ncountry. These Ambassadors, judges, and appointed officials who serve \\nin the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the inspectors \\ngeneral who make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent legally and \\nefficiently and that people are doing their jobs--none of those \\npositions are able to be filled.\\n  I would point out that this rule change does not apply to all \\nnominees. High-level Cabinet positions and Supreme Court Justices would \\nstill receive the 30 hours of debate time after 51 Senators have voted \\nto proceed to that vote.\\n  It is important to note that this type of rules change isn't new. \\nActually, in 2013, there was a negotiated, bipartisan standing rule \\nwhen Majority Leader Harry Reid and the current Democratic leader, \\nChuck Schumer, introduced a similar change to speed up the process, and \\nthis simply builds on the foundation they laid down. So if we asked \\nthem to do now what was done then on a bipartisan basis, their answer \\nwill be no--for no good reason other than it is President Trump who \\nwould presumably benefit from this restoration of that same process.\\n  As I said, the real hypocrisy of their position is indicated by the \\nfact that they said they would vote for this rule, but they don't want \\nit to take effect now. They want it to take effect in 2021. In short, \\nthey appear to believe that what we are trying to do is an important \\nrules change to make, but they don't want to do it if it benefits a \\nPresident they clearly despise.\\n  This political theater is being orchestrated by Senate Democrats and \\nis impacting our ability to carry out our constitutional duty of advice \\nand consent. I believe this is a necessary step to get the Senate back \\non track, and I will support this rules change when it comes to the \\nfloor for a vote and would encourage all of my colleagues to do the \\nsame.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=943, text=\"  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today as one of a number of our \\ncolleagues to talk about something that really bothers me. We are \\nseeing historic obstructionism in the Senate today. It has been going \\non for the last 2 years.\\n  One of the fundamental responsibilities in the Senate is to provide \\nadvice and consent on Presidential nominations. When President Trump \\ntook office, he acted with urgency to fill positions in his \\nadministration with highly qualified and highly skilled, experienced \\nindividuals from the real world--not just people from the bubble but \\npeople from America. Unfortunately, Democrats have slow-walked this \\nconfirmation process every step of the way. In my view, this is \\nhistoric obstructionism, and it needs to stop.\\n  This is the first time in U.S. history that the minority party has \\nnot waived the 30-hour debate rule to this degree. As a result, of the \\n1,200 nominees to be confirmed by any new President, only 714 have been \\nconfirmed to date. At the end of last year, because of this historic \\nDemocratic obstructionism, we had 386 nominations in line waiting to be \\nconfirmed. At the end of Obama's first 2 years, only 5 nominees were \\noutstanding, compared to the 386 for President Trump at the end of last \\nyear.\\n  Let me say that again. At the end of President Obama's first 2 years, \\nonly five nominees had not been confirmed. That means that out of \\neverybody he sent to the Senate, only five at that point had not been \\nconfirmed. However, at the end of December this past year, President \\nTrump still had 386 nominees in the pipeline right here in the U.S. \\nSenate, waiting for us to get to them.\\n  Of the last three Presidents, we have collectively only had 24 \\ncloture votes required by the minority party--only 24. However, during \\nPresident Trump's first 2 years, Democrats forced 128 cloture votes on \\nnominees on the Senate floor. Each one of these cloture votes requires \\n30 hours of debate. We can't do anything else on the floor while we are \\ndoing that. That means the normal business of the Senate cannot be \\ntransacted because we are waiting, due to the 30-hour debate rule, to \\nget to the vote. Basically, under those realities, the Senate is able \\nto do only one confirmation per week. Do the math--386 weeks is a long \\ntime.\\n  What is going on here has nothing to do with the nominees' \\nqualifications, either. Every single one of Donald Trump's nominees who \\nreceived a recorded vote was passed. Not one has failed to pass in this \\nbody--not one. The vast majority of these nominees are noncontroversial \\nand get more than 70 or 80 votes and in some cases more than that.\\n  This chart shows that of the cloture votes we have had to take, 48 \\npercent got more than 60 votes, and 37 percent got more than 70. That \\nmeans 70 percent of the nominees got more than 60 votes. These are not \\ncontroversial nominees. That is not the issue.\\n  My own cousin, who is now Secretary of Agriculture, waited 4 months. \\nI know this personally because he bunked in my place for 4 months while \\nwe were waiting to get his confirmation. When he finally got to the \\nfloor of the Senate, he got 87 votes.\\n  It is clear that the Democrats will stop at nothing to obstruct the \\nSenate from working on real issues. Every hour we have to spend in the \\n30-hour waiting period is time we can't utilize to take up the \\ncountry's business and the priorities Americans want us to be working \\non. If this obstruction continues, President Trump will not have his \\nfull team in place until the end of his second term.\\n  These delays are petty, and the American people have had enough. I \\nhear about it every time I go home.\\n  For the last 2 years, several of my colleagues and I have pushed to \\nkeep the Senate in session during the traditional August State work \\nbreak in order to confirm nominees and make progress on funding the \\nFederal Government. In August of 2017, the leader of the majority \\nparty, Senator McConnell, agreed to keep us here for the month of \\nAugust in order to work on several things we were working on, including \\nconfirming these nominees. The minority party agreed, after 4 days, to \\nbasically confirm 77 nominees on that one day. What makes that \\nimportant is that prior to that time in August, in all of that year, we \\nhad only been able to get 44 nominees confirmed. While staying here \\nlast August, in 2018, we confirmed 43 nominees and completed 75 percent \\nof the government funding bills.\\n  As I speak today, there are 249 nominees before the U.S. Senate \\nwaiting to be confirmed. Basically, that would require 249 weeks to do \\nif we follow the rule we have been following over the last 2 years. \\nThese nominees include the Assistant Secretary of Readiness for the \\nDepartment of Defense, who has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 \\nmonths. This is in the Department of Defense, the Assistant Secretary \\nfor Readiness--one of the crisis areas we have in our military. For 8 \\nmonths this nominee has been waiting to be confirmed. The Under \\nSecretary for Food Safety in the Department of Agriculture--one I hear \\na lot about--has been waiting 9 months in line to be confirmed.\\n  The people on the other side are saying: The President is just not \\nsending up nominees fast enough.\\n  Well, what happens with these folks who have been sitting here for 9 \\nmonths waiting to be confirmed?\\n  The Assistant Secretary for Economic Development at the Department of \\nCommerce has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 months.\\n  These are not low-level nominees; these are Assistant Secretaries who \\nare waiting to be confirmed.\\n  This has to stop. This President is not even able to form his own \\nCabinet in complete terms because these Assistant Secretaries are not \\nin place. We should be working around-the-clock to get these people \\nconfirmed.\\n  If this obstructionism continues, we should try to change the \\nexisting rules for confirming nominees by reducing the 30-hour debate \\nrule at minimum. There is a plan in the Senate right now that would \\nreduce the 30 hours of debate to 8 hours for most and 2 hours for\\n\\n\\nsome. Reducing the debate time required would speed up the confirmation \\nprocess and allow us to focus on other business in the Senate that \\npeople want us to address. Every single Democrat in the Senate today \\nwho was also here in 2013 supported reducing debate time on nominees, \\nand they should do so again right now.\\n\\n  I will close by saying that despite this historic obstructionism, the \\nSenate has, indeed, over the last 2 years--because we focused on this \\nas a priority, even with this 30-hour debate rule being enacted--we \\nconfirmed 63 district court judges, 31 circuit court of appeals \\njustices, and two Supreme Court Justices. These judges will have an \\nimpact on the judiciary for years to come.\\n  By the way, these are not activists with political agendas or \\nmotives. They are accomplished, experienced jurists, dedicated to \\nupholding the Constitution and adhering to the rule of law. It is \\ncriminal that we waited that long to get these people confirmed.\\n  I applaud the President for nominating such outstanding individuals \\nto these positions. If this historic obstructionism continues in the \\nSenate, I believe President Trump will not have his full team in place \\nuntil the end of his second term, if then. This obstruction needs to \\nend. The resistance movement threatens the security of our country and \\nour ability to deal with the problems facing America today. It is time \\nto rise above this partisan gridlock, change the rules, confirm these \\nnominees, and finally begin to get results for the American people.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=945, text=\"  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \\nIRS and tax issues and the tax bill last year, but following on what \\nSenator Perdue said, I want to, first of all, compliment him for not \\nonly this speech but several times he has talked about how the Senate \\nhas stalled time after time on nominees.\\n  I want to bring to my colleagues' attention that at one time, there \\nwas a lot of concern by President Obama that his nominees were not \\nbeing confirmed fast enough. We started hearing that in January 2013. \\nAll of a sudden, there was a feeling that we ought to have a bipartisan \\nsolution to this issue to speed along President Obama's nominees. At \\none time, the Democratic leader then was talking about using a nuclear \\noption to accomplish a change in rules. Both Republicans and Democrats \\nthought that wasn't a very good idea, so Republicans and Democrats got \\ntogether and agreed to reduce postcloture debate time for the rest of \\nthe 113th Congress, although, before that Congress ended, Senator Reid \\ndecided to use the nuclear option anyway, and he did that at a later \\ntime.\\n  If Republicans and Democrats could get together in the 113th Congress \\nto speed up the time and have less postcloture debate time, why can't \\nwe do it now? The problem, of course, is for the Trump nominees being \\nheld up in the Senate, the time is far worse than it was under \\nPresident Obama or, for that matter, any other President before that.\\n  It seems to me, as we are talking about changing the post-debate time \\nagain--because there is a resolution out of our Rules Committee--I \\nthink it is about time that we think that what is good for the goose is \\ngood for the gander, and we ought to reinstate that bipartisan \\nagreement. I hope we can get the support of Democrats to do that like \\nthey had the support of Republicans to do that when we had a Democratic \\nPresident.\\n  I thank Senator Perdue for what he spoke about on a longer basis than \\nI just did, but I want to back him up fully.\\n\\n\\n                               Tax Reform\\n\\n  Mr. President, we are in the fifth week of the tax filing season. \\nBased on all reports from the IRS, the filing season is running \\nsmoothly. All systems are operating as expected. Returns are being \\nprocessed and refunds are being sent out without any major \\ncomplications.\\n  According to IRS Commissioner Rettig, his Agency has even set a \\ncouple of internal records for the speed at which returns are being \\nprocessed. At one point, the IRS processed 1.9 million returns in an \\nhour. That is 536 every single second.\\n  Of course, you don't hear much about how the filing season is running \\nsmoothly from our mainstream press. There is a lot of positive news, \\nbut positive news doesn't seem to make good headlines. Instead, an \\nobsession has developed around the size of the tax returns, not the \\nexact tax that might actually be paid.\\n  Let's set aside that the available Treasury data is merely in the \\nfirst few weeks of a very unusual tax season due to the partial \\ngovernment shutdown. Never mind that the size of the average tax refund \\ncan vary greatly from week to week, making year-over-year comparisons \\nearly in the filing season essentially meaningless. Let's ignore the \\nimportant fact that less than half as many child tax credits and \\nearned-income tax credits have been issued as compared to the last year \\nbased almost entirely on calendar factors, and, most importantly, we \\nought to somehow forget about the fact that the size of one's tax \\nrefund tells you absolutely nothing about a taxpayers' overall tax \\nreturn.\\n  I have been amazed by how many of my colleagues on the other side of \\nthe aisle, who should know better, have sought to equate incomplete \\ninformation about lower average refunds--telling us all that means \\npeople have not received a decrease in their taxes.\\n  I want to quote Howard Gleckman, who should be well respected by \\npeople on the other side of the aisle because he is a senior fellow at \\nthe liberal Tax Policy Center. He characterized the current obsession \\nwith tax refunds as ``wrong-headed,'' noting that it is ``not how big a \\nrefund check filers get this year but how much total tax they paid for \\n2018.'' That is common sense. I thank Howard Gleckman for his common \\nsense.\\n  Yet my colleagues--again, on the other side--continue to try and push \\nthe false narrative that a smaller refund is synonymous with tax \\nincrease. That doesn't meet the commonsense test.\\n  Just such a claim by a Senate Democrat running for President was \\nobserved by the Washington Post's Fact Checker as being ``nonsensical \\nand misleading.'' The claim was awarded four Pinocchios. Four \\nPinocchios is a rating the Post reserves for the biggest whoppers.\\n  Here are the straight facts. Anyone telling the American public that \\na smaller refund is the same as a tax increase is being intentionally \\nmisleading and doing a disservice to the public. I classify that as a \\nbig lie. The size of one's tax refund merely reflects what that \\ntaxpayer overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year. For the vast \\nmajority of Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 \\ndelivered larger paychecks starting last February. The liberal Tax \\nPolicy Center confirms that 90 percent of middle-income taxpayers will \\nreceive a tax cut. That is right. Taxes went down, not up, for the vast \\nmajority of American families.\\n  This tax relief stems from the combination of pro-middle-class and \\npro-family provisions, including a nearly doubled standard deduction, \\nan increase in the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and overall \\nlower tax rates. That is how you give the middle class a tax cut.\\n  Some may believe that we would have been better off depriving \\ntaxpayers of their tax cuts until the IRS sent them a refund after the \\nend of the year, but this thinking gets things exactly backward. The \\nexcess tax withheld from paychecks throughout the course of a year \\ndoesn't belong to the government; it belongs to the taxpayers who \\nearned that money. It is the taxpayers who should be able to decide \\nwhether they want to put their weekly or monthly tax savings in a \\nretirement account, pay down a credit card bill, enroll their children \\nin some club, sport, music, or dance lessons, or maybe even make an \\nextra car payment.\\n  I encourage all taxpayers interested in how tax reform affects their \\nbottom line to compare this year's tax return with last year's tax \\nreturn. That is the commonsense way of figuring out whether your taxes \\nwent up or down as a result of the tax bill of 2017. When they do that, \\nthe vast majority will see less of their hard-earned money being sent \\nto Washington, DC. Really, that is what ought to matter.\\n  I encourage those in the media who are actually interested in how tax \\nreform has affected taxpayers to take\\n\\n\\ninto account the positive signs we see all around. It is a positive \\nsign when we write about how blue-collar employment has surged; \\npositive signs about how low-income workers experienced the highest \\nwage growth in a decade; positive signs when we report how new business \\nstartups are climbing and how U.S. manufacturers had their best year \\nsince 1997; and positive signs as you discuss how the economy grew \\nalmost 50 percent faster in 2018 than as President Obama's economists \\npredicted when they predicted slow growth would be the new normal.\\n  All of these subjects are far more important than what has thus far, \\nin most all respects, been an uneventful filing season. Compare this \\nyear's tax bottom line with last year's tax bottom line to decide \\nwhether you got a tax decrease or a tax increase, not the size of your \\nrefund.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Social Security & Tax Reform'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=949, text=\"  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, 2 years ago, I came to this floor of the \\nSenate to talk about the rules process and nominations in particular \\nbecause, even 2 years ago, we were experiencing the beginning of what I \\nsaw to be a trend.\\n  When elected to office, every President has about 1,200 nominations \\nthat have to come through the Senate for what is called advice and \\nconsent. Those individuals go through background checks at the White \\nHouse, they go through interviews through the White House, and they go \\nthrough the extensive review of references. Then they are recommended \\nto the respective committees here, where they again go through \\nbackground checks, have conversations, interviews, public hearings, \\nquestions for the record after the hearings are over, and go through \\nany followup from any individual American who wants to give input \\nwhether that input be from outside groups here or from anywhere else in \\nthe country. Then they come to the floor of the Senate.\\n  In the past, those individuals moved through quickly because there \\nwere 1,200 of them, but the minority has always had the right to have \\none last, little slowdown when they have gotten to the floor. They can \\nmake what is called a cloture vote request. The minority--any \\nindividual--could always make a request for a cloture vote to say: I \\nknow they have gone through all of these extensive checks, that they \\nhave already passed the committee, that they have gone through all of \\nthe process, but at the end, I want an additional 30 hours of debate on \\nthese people. Yet it is not just 30 hours of debate; it is actually \\nwhat is called a full intervening day. After that, there is an \\nadditional 30 hours of debate for that person.\\n  That has been done in the past but very rarely in the first 2 years \\nof a Presidency because there are so many nominations that have to go \\nthrough the process. If we go back to President Clinton, there were \\neight of those requests. For President Bush, there were four of those. \\nFor President Obama, there were 12 of those. For President Trump, there \\nhave been 128 of those.\\n  Two years ago, I saw the trend of where this was heading. This was a \\nnew structure for the beginning of a Presidency. I was concerned at \\nthat time, but I have an even greater concern now. It is the trend of \\nwhere we are headed as a Senate. Is this going to be the new normal? \\nThis used to be what was normal: Occasional nominees would come through \\nif they were very controversial. Yet most of these nominees were not \\nreally all that controversial. In fact, 48 percent of those nominees \\nwho had the additional cloture time then got more than 60 votes. In \\nfact, 37 percent of them got more than 70 votes. These were not \\ncontroversial individuals coming through; it was just an intentional \\nslowing down of the process.\\n  I have heard folks say: There are so many of these judges who are \\ncoming through at the district court level that they become very \\ncontroversial.\\n  Quite frankly, every single judge who comes through has to be \\napproved by the two Senators from that State through what is called the \\nblue-slip process. This is for all of those district court judges. It \\nis a process that has been honored by previous administrations and by \\nthis administration. This Senate has honored those same blue slips for \\nall of the district court judges. If the judges are from a Democratic \\nState, both of those Democratic Senators have to approve of them before \\nthey come. If the judges are from a State that has one Democrat and one \\nRepublican, it has to be split. If there are two Republicans, they both \\nhave to agree to it. This is for all of the district court judges. Yet \\nthey are still being slowed down. They have gone through the background \\nchecks, and they have been approved by their home State Senators \\nregardless of party; yet they are slowed down.\\n  So whether they are executive nominees or whether they are judicial \\nnominees, these 128 individuals being slowed down has created a new \\nslowdown in the Senate.\\n  Two years ago, I made a proposal to go back to something that Harry \\nReid proposed and was passed by this Senate in 2013, which was long \\nbefore I was here. It was a 2-year agreement to just say: Here is how \\nwe are going to deal with what is called postcloture debate time. If \\nthere is a controversial nominee, here is how we will handle it.\\n  I went to my colleagues and said: Let's revive that rule. Instead of \\nmaking it for 2 years, which was the Harry Reid rule, let's just make \\nit from here on out. I made that proposal in the last Senate. We took \\nthat to the Rules Committee. It passed the Rules Committee, but it \\ncould not pass on this floor.\\n  I thought it was eminently kind and bipartisan to say that I would go \\nback and grab Harry Reid's rule and that if it was good for the \\nDemocrats when they were in the leadership, it should be good for \\neverybody regardless of whether it is the Republicans or the Democrats. \\nIt did not pass.\\n  I have once again come back and made a proposal to say let's fix this \\nand to not just fix this for now but to fix this from here on out. \\nWhether there will be a Democratic President or a Republican President \\nin the future, let's have a simple rule: If we get to a nominee who has \\ngone through the background checks of the White House, has gone through \\nthe committee and passed the committee, and has gone through additional \\nquestions for the record--all of that--if people still want additional \\ntime, they can still request the intervening day, but then instead of \\n30 hours after that full day, it would be just 2 hours of additional \\ntime.\\n  Quite frankly, during most of the time that we have had the 30 hours \\nof debate, there hasn't really been debate on the floor for 30 hours; \\nthere has been debate on the floor for, say, 15 or 20 minutes. For the \\nrest of the time, the floor has sat empty or we have debated other \\nthings other than the nominee.\\n  So we would set aside 2 additional hours. We would do this for \\ndistrict court judges, and we would do this for most of the nominees \\nfor the executive branch, but we would still hold that 30 hours for \\nthings like nominees for the circuit court, the Supreme Court, and \\nthose at the Cabinet level. For those types of positions, sure, keep \\nthe 30 hours, but for the other 1,000-plus nominees who are to be the \\nDeputy Secretaries or assistants of whatever it may be, allow them to \\ngo through the normal process and not slow it down.\\n  The Chief Counsel for the IRS has not been confirmed. He went through \\nthe last Congress, but he didn't get there. He passed 25 to 2 out of \\ncommittee. He passed 26 to 2 out of committee this time; yet there is a \\nrequirement of 30 additional hours of debate on the floor. He will \\nprobably pass overwhelmingly, but it is just a tactic to slow down this \\nfloor.\\n  We have a lot of business to do. Let's make a rule that is fair, and \\nlet's make it work for everyone. My concern is, long-term for the \\nSenate, this will be the new trend, and the next time there is a \\nDemocratic President, this is what Republicans will do to Democratic \\nPresidents, and this will be the new way that we operate.\\n  This isn't helpful for any President; this isn't helpful for the \\nSenate; and this is something we need to fix.\\n  We have 2 years of muscle memory on this now--of doing it over and \\nover\\n\\n\\nand over. I don't think this gets better because I think the political \\npressure will be there just to keep doing this and slowing things down \\nfor everybody.\\n  So we put a rule out there. It has gone through the Rules Committee. \\nI have encouraged my Democratic colleagues to join in with this because \\nthere will be a Democratic President someday in the future, and they \\nwill not want this coming back at them and will say this is unfair, and \\nI will agree. But it will happen, so let's fix it now. Let's resolve \\nthis in this Senate in this time from here on out--not a short-term \\nrule but long-term, permanent--to take us back to this being the norm, \\nwhen we could work better together.\\n  I love hearing everyone say that we should be more bipartisan as a \\nbody. I would love to get this body working again. That is this \\nproposal. This proposal is not a partisan proposal. It is not trying to \\nget leverage on anybody. It is trying to get this body back to working \\nagain, and I hope in the weeks ahead, when this rule actually comes to \\nthe floor of the Senate, we can get overwhelming bipartisan support for \\nit so that we can get back to working together.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a vote that \\nwe will be having in just a few minutes on the process of moving Andrew \\nWheeler forward as the EPA Administrator.\\n  This is not a time for talk; it is not time for theoretical debates. \\nThis is certainly not the time for an EPA Administrator who, during his \\ntime at the EPA, has ignored climate scientists, rolled back climate \\nregulations, and taken action that will lead to more carbon pollution.\\n  Instead, this is a time for bold, decisive action. We need to act \\ntoday because life on our planet depends on it. The fate of our Nation \\ndepends on it. Our children's and grandchildren's futures depend on it.\\n  For those reasons, I cannot support Andrew Wheeler for the critical \\nposition of EPA Administrator.\\n  Climate change is real. In fact, it is more than real. It is an \\nexistential crisis, and it is already having real impact on Michigan \\nfamilies and Michigan's economy.\\n  Some call it global warming. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist \\nfrom Texas Tech, has a better term. She call calls it ``global \\nweirding.'' Ask anybody in Michigan. Things have been weird.\\n  Our lakes are heating up. In fact, Lake Superior is getting about 2 \\ndegrees warmer each decade. That could make the lake a happy home for \\ninvasive species, like sea lamprey.\\n  As the waters warm, these parasites grow and kill off more trout and \\nsalmon and other fish that are key to the Great Lakes' $8 billion \\nrecreational fishing industry. It is believed that warmer temperatures \\ncontributed to algal blooms on the lake last summer.\\n  Other changes we are seeing are life-threatening.\\n  Thanks to the polar vortex in January, Michigan experienced \\ntemperatures colder than Antarctica. Scientists believe that climate \\nchange has caused the jet stream to become wobbly--that is a technical \\nterm, ``wobbly''--pushing dangerously frigid air south.\\n  Folks say: Well, how can it be global warming when we see the polar \\nvortex? It is about what is happening to destabilize the atmosphere and \\nthe planet and the changes that are occurring.\\n  Last weekend, a bomb cyclone hit my State, leaving tens of thousands \\nof Michigan residents without power.\\n  We are having to come up with new terms. I had never heard of a bomb \\ncyclone--60-mile-an-hour winds, ripping up homes and farms and \\nroadways.\\n  The intensity of what is happening is incredible. The travel was so \\ntreacherous in Otsego County that all roads were closed--all of the \\nroads were closed. Even drivers on Interstate 75 were getting stuck in \\ndrifts. That is our major highway.\\n  We can't link any specific storm to climate change. However, we do \\nknow that overall climate change is making storms more intense. They \\nare longer. They are more intense. They are happening more frequently \\nwith more intensity.\\n  Last summer in Houghton County, more than 5\\\\1/2\\\\ inches of rain fell \\nin 6 hours. It caused at least $100 million in damage to \\ninfrastructure, and a 12-year-old-boy died when the basement of his \\nhome collapsed.\\n  Our climate is changing, but you don't have to take my word for it. \\nJust ask insurance company executives. Their companies paid out a \\nrecord $135 billion--billion dollars--from natural disasters in 2017 \\nalone. That is almost three times as much as the historic annual \\naverage, and their projections show it getting worse.\\n  We need to take action on climate change. While it is not widely \\nrecognized, I want to speak about something positive that we have done, \\nand that was last year's farm bill.\\n  As you know, the farm bill passed the Senate with a vote of 87 to \\n13--the most votes in history. While the bill was historic for a number \\nof reasons, one of those is that it includes the most ambitious Federal \\nclimate-smart agricultural and forestry policies to date, working with \\nfarmers and ranchers as partners.\\n  It helps farmers implement climate-smart policies by revamping USDA \\nconservation programs to prioritize investments in soil carbon \\nsequestration, incentivizing the planting of cover crops, and expanding \\nUSDA support for farmer participation in carbon markets.\\n  It also invests in the Rural Energy for America Program, which helps \\nfarmers and rural small businesses install renewable energy systems and \\ncreates a joint USDA-Department of Energy education grant program to \\ndrive carbon capture projects across rural America.\\n  We must also protect forests and farmland, which serve as vital \\ncarbon sinks that hold carbon rather than releasing it and making the \\ndestabilization even worse.\\n  The farm bill amends the popular Healthy Forests Reserve Program to \\nprioritize carbon sequestration practices programs and discourage the \\ndevelopment of forestland. It authorizes new programs to restore \\nnational forest landscapes, protect carbon-rich, old-growth trees, and \\nprevent uncharacteristic wildfires and their emissions. It establishes \\na landmark soil health demonstration trial to keep carbon in the ground \\nand promote healthy and productive farmland.\\n  I am proud of what we did. It was done with the partnership of \\nfarmers and ranchers, and I have to say that our farmers understand the \\nimportance of protecting our land--their land--air, and water, I think, \\nas much as, if not more than anyone else. No one's business is more \\nimpacted by severe and erratic weather than our farmers. They are \\ncaught right in the middle of it, and I appreciate their working with \\nus to be part of the solution.\\n  I am also working with my colleagues on policies to ensure that the \\nUnited States, not China, is the global leader on advanced \\ntransportation technologies like electric and hydrogen vehicles.\\n  Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration are upending \\nfuel economy and carbon regulations in a way that hurts the auto \\nindustry, consumers, and our environment. We need to invest more in \\nrenewable energy and the research that is making it more affordable all \\nthe time.\\n  Electric utilities in Michigan have committed to dramatically \\nincrease renewable electricity, reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent, \\nand stop burning coal.\\n  Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration have rolled \\nback the historic Clean Power Plan.\\n  I am proud of the fact that Michigan utilities are moving forward \\nanyway because they know it is the right thing and they know what is at \\nstake. But this administration--Andrew Wheeler--has rolled back the \\nhistoric Clean Power Plan, the Nation's first regulation of greenhouse \\ngases from the power sector.\\n  We need to be laser-focused on climate change and the existential \\nthreat it represents. Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump \\nadministration are doing their best to pretend that climate change is \\nno big deal. That is even as the Pentagon recently concluded that two-\\nthirds of critical military installations are threatened--two-thirds of \\ncritical military installations are threatened--by climate change.\\n\\n\\n  Climate change is a big deal, and it is time to do something about it \\nthat is real--not play political games, but to actually do something \\nthoughtful and real about it.\\n  In the wise words of Hank Williams, Jr., ``We need a little less talk \\nand a lot more action.'' Andrew Wheeler has repeatedly shown no \\ninterest in acting. In fact, he wants to take us backward--and is \\ntaking us backward--on climate change. He has no interest in reducing, \\nlet alone eliminating, carbon pollution. We need to act, and it is \\nclear that Andrew Wheeler is the wrong person to lead the EPA at this \\ncritical time for our country.\\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on Andrew Wheeler for EPA Administrator.\\n\\n\\n                        Nomination of Neomi Rao\\n\\n  Mr. President, one other brief comment, as some colleagues will be \\ncoming to the floor in a bit, and I want to join them in speaking about \\nthe DC Circuit Court nominee Neomi Rao. I stand with them in opposing \\nthis nomination.\\n  In the era of #MeToo, when women are sharing their stories about \\nassault and abuse, we don't need a judge who has written that women who \\ndrink are to blame if they are then sexually assaulted.\\n  We do not need a judge who blocked a critical equal pay measure \\nintended to help close the wage gap.\\n  So I join with colleagues in encouraging, at the appropriate time, a \\n``no'' vote on this nomination.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",

They rallied. They marched. They made clear they do \\nnot want to go back to the days before the Roe v. Wade decision \\naffirmed their right to make their own healthcare decisions.\\n  Incredibly brave survivors, such as Dr. Ford and so many others, said \\nthey wanted to be heard and believed, not silenced.\\n  Families across the country said they wanted a Justice who would \\ninterpret the law fairly and objectively, without partisanship--someone \\nwhose priority is the Constitution and people across the country, not \\nPresident Trump and his extreme agenda.\\n  Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it is clear that President Trump \\nand Republicans in Congress aren't listening to women or survivors or \\nfamilies, because the next nominee for the DC Circuit Court fails on \\neach and every count I just listed.\\n  As we speak, Neomi Rao is enacting the Trump agenda in her role as \\nthe head of the Agency that reviews and approves the Trump \\nadministration's changes to regulations impacting so many people in \\ncommunities who stood up to oppose Justice Kavanaugh's nomination.\\n  Under Ms. Rao's leadership, the Trump administration finalized a rule \\nthat prevents healthcare providers from even informing patients who \\ncome to title X-funded health centers about where to go to get safe--\\nsafe--legal abortions and places new, burdensome, medically unnecessary \\nrequirements on title X-funded health centers, designed specifically to \\nprevent Planned Parenthood from receiving these funds, meaning millions \\nof patients may lose a source of quality, affordable, basic healthcare \\nthey trust.\\n  Ms. Rao has helped put forward rules that would make it harder for \\nmembers of the LGBTQ community and women to get the care they need by \\nallowing providers to turn them away simply because of who they are or \\nbecause they want birth control.\\n  I also want to take a few minutes to address Ms. Rao's deeply \\nconcerning comments about rape and sexual assault. While in college, \\nshe wrote that ``a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay \\nreasonably sober.''\\n  Let's be clear. It is never a survivor's fault, ever, that someone \\nraped or sexually assaulted them.\\n  Ms. Rao was given an opportunity to explicitly reject those comments \\nand failed to do so. She then sent a letter attempting to walk them \\nback, but her actions speak louder than a letter sent during a \\nnomination process, and her actions on this issue have been harmful.\\n  In her role within the Trump administration, Ms. Rao has helped \\nSecretary DeVos to roll back protections that help survivors get \\njustice when they are sexually assaulted on campuses. In other words, \\nat the same time that Ms. Rao claims her views have changed on sexual \\nassault and consent, her actions are aligned with those who believe \\nwhat she wrote in college. To the survivors I hear from and those who \\nbravely spoke out against Justice Kavanaugh and so many others, Ms. \\nRao's actions are what matters.\\n  Ms. Rao is also listening to corporate lobbyists instead of \\nscientists when it comes to climate and our public health and is \\nadvancing rules that would allow more discrimination in our Nation's \\nhousing programs. Unfortunately, it seems that on many issues, where \\nPresident Trump wants to do damage and hurt families, Ms. Rao is right \\nbehind him with a rubberstamp, just like Justice Kavanaugh and so many \\nothers President Trump has nominated to the bench.\\n  We need judges who will do what workers and families expect of a \\njudge--to interpret our laws according to the Constitution and what is \\nbest for our country, not according to politics and what is best for \\nPresident Trump.

      "Pandas(Index=957, text=\"  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to President \\nTrump's nominee for Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service, \\nMichael Desmond.\\n  This nominee comes before us just a week into this year's filing \\nseason, when our need for an IRS that treats all taxpayers fairly is \\nclearer than ever.\\n  Already, thousands of taxpayers across America are grappling with the \\nfallout of the Trump tax bill and its capping of the State and local \\ntax, or SALT, deduction. Already, the IRS has reported an average 17 \\npercent drop in the size of tax refunds this year. Already, the broken \\npromises made by President Trump and his Republican allies are being \\nlaid bare.\\n  They promised middle-class families thousands of dollars of tax \\nrelief and a $4,000 raise in their salaries. Instead, they got $1.5 \\ntrillion in more debt and an economy that is even more rigged for big \\ncorporations and wealthy CEOs.\\n  As bad as the Trump tax scam is for the whole country, it is worse \\nfor New Jersey families. That is because Republicans paid for a big \\nchunk of their corporate giveaways by gutting the State and local tax \\ndeduction that New Jersey and other States' middle-class families \\ndepend on to write off their property taxes. In 2016, 1.8 million \\npeople--about 40 percent of New Jersey taxpayers--deducted their \\nproperty and State income taxes. More than 80 percent of them earned \\nless than $200,000, and the average deduction totaled $18,000--far \\nabove the arbitrary cap imposed by the Trump tax bill.\\n  With tax season under way, many homeowners are just now realizing how \\nbadly their President ripped them off. To add insult to injury, the IRS \\nissued haphazard guidance for the Trump tax bill that unfairly targets \\nStates like New Jersey, trying to simply lessen the burden heaped on \\nthem by the GOP.\\n  In the final days of 2017, just days after President Trump signed the \\ntax bill, New Jerseyans rushed to prepay their 2018 local property \\ntaxes and preserve their deductions before the new cap on the SALT \\ndeductions took effect. But then came Trump's IRS, which issued \\nguidance to try to limit their ability to deduct property tax payments \\nmade in 2017 on their Federal returns--a stunning backdoor attempt to \\nretroactively apply the cap on property tax deductions without cleared \\nlegislative tax to warrant doing so.\\n\\n\\n  Months later, the IRS again changed the rules on us by attacking New \\nJersey's new charitable deduction tax credit program. The IRS never had \\na problem when 32 other States offered tax credits for charitable \\ndonations. Only when New Jersey and other similarly situated States \\ncreated a similar program did the IRS decide to change the rules.\\n  Mr. Desmond would be the Chief Counsel of the IRS, the position \\ndirectly overseeing the IRS's interpretation of these rule changes. \\nThroughout his nomination, I was given no indication that Mr. Desmond \\nwould give fair treatment on these important issues affecting New \\nJersey and other States.\\n  The full deductibility of State and local taxes has been a bedrock \\nprinciple of our Tax Code since the income tax's creation in 1913, and \\nthat concept stretches all the way back to Alexander Hamilton's \\nwritings about the autonomy of States under the U.S. Constitution.\\n  This commonsense policy allows States to invest in things like public \\nsafety, education, and infrastructure--the very things that make New \\nJersey a great place to live, work, and raise a family.\\n  Make no mistake, the property tax deduction isn't just important for \\nhomeowners. It matters to all New Jersey families. It is why our public \\nschools rank among the best in the Nation. It is why Save the Children \\nnamed us the No. 1 State in America to raise a child. I want it to stay \\nthat way.\\n  We must protect the investments that make New Jersey a place where \\nfamilies thrive. That is why last month I introduced bipartisan \\nlegislation to fully restore the State and local tax deduction. It is \\ncalled the SALT Act, which stands for ``Stop the Attack on Local \\nTaxpayers.'' It is no secret that in New Jersey and in many of the \\nNation's most economically productive States, families face high \\nproperty tax bills and a higher cost of living. Our bill is designed to \\nprovide some relief. Simply put, the more you pay in property and State \\ntaxes, the more relief you get from our bill, and we help pay for it by \\nrepealing some of Trump's most unnecessary tax breaks for the \\nsuperwealthy. It is the exact opposite of what the Trump tax bill says, \\nwhich is, basically that the higher the cost of living is in your \\nState, the more you pay in State and local taxes and the more you will \\nowe to the Federal Government. That makes no sense.\\n  Make no mistake, President Trump and his administration and the IRS \\nhave it out for States like New Jersey. Mr. Desmond would be the \\narbiter of how the IRS would interpret important tax issues affecting \\nthese States. That is why I oppose his nomination.\\n  I yield back my time.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=987, text=\"  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \\nhighlight the visionary and unwavering leadership of civil rights icon \\nand notable Oklahoman Ms. Clara Luper.\\n  Six months ago, I got to witness history as Oklahoma City \\ncommemorated the 60th anniversary of the sit-ins she organized. I rise \\ntoday because, even as a fifth-generation Oklahoman, I realized how \\nlittle I knew.\\n  Clara Luper and her students sparked a movement, the sit-ins that led \\ninto our Nation's civil rights movement. They deserve to be a household \\nname.\\n  Clara Luper made her mark in a time when people of color couldn't \\neven walk into the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They were \\nrelegated to hidden back rooms.\\n  But she had a vision for equality, a heart for service, and a \\ncommitment to justice. She, in her words, ``believed in a sun when it \\ndidn't shine and the rain when it didn't fall.'' She knew that Oklahoma \\nand this country could be a place where everyone is treated with \\nrespect, dignity, and humanity.\\n  Even as a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer, Oklahoma, \\nMs. Luper instilled those principles in her students. Her steadfast \\ncommitment to ending racism and systemic discrimination inspired her to \\norganize America's first sit-in.\\n  In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP Youth Council students walked \\nup to a lunch counter they knew would refuse them, and they ordered a \\nhamburger and a Coke. They were denied, but they did not waver. They \\nknew what was on the line because, in Ms. Luper's words, ``within that \\nhamburger was the whole essence of democracy.''\\n  At their own personal peril, they returned each day with more people \\nuntil they broke the barrier. It was never easy. The protesters were \\nverbally and physically assaulted, and Ms. Luper received death \\nthreats.\\n  Because of Ms. Luper and her students' fearlessness and \\ndetermination, the Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters, \\nnot just in Oklahoma City but also in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa.\\n  When the 1958 sit-in happened in Oklahoma City, a group of college \\nstudents in North Carolina were inspired by what had taken place in \\nOklahoma City, and they took note. In 1961, those students launched the \\nGreensboro, North Carolina, sit-in at the Woolworth lunch counter, \\nwhich fueled momentum within the civil rights movement.\\n  It didn't end there. For years, Ms. Luper and others continued their \\nfight. The sacrifices continued, too.\\n  Authorities arrested Ms. Luper 26 times during her fight for freedom. \\nClara Luper empowered young people to imagine a future brighter than \\ntheir present and taught them how to make that future a reality.\\n  She changed lives and planted seeds of ethical leadership into those \\nwho were lucky enough to be mentored by her. Each of her former \\nstudents talks about the pivotal role Ms. Luper played in instilling \\nconfidence, character, and dignity in them.\\n  Generations reap the benefit of her sacrifice and efforts to \\nintegrate not only businesses in Oklahoma City but educational spaces.\\n  Ms. Luper integrated the history department at the University of \\nOklahoma, becoming the first Black graduate of that master's program. \\nHer contributions are reflected across our\\n\\n\\nown State, in a namesake scholarship program at Oklahoma City \\nUniversity, a corridor on the northeast side of Oklahoma City, a \\nclassroom at the University of Central Oklahoma, by the designation of \\nthe Oklahoma City Public Schools District building as The Clara Luper \\nCenter, and naming the African American studies department at the \\nUniversity of Oklahoma after her.\\n  As a lifelong Oklahoman and representative of the Fifth Congressional \\nDistrict, and as an American, I recognize how we are beneficiaries of \\nClara Luper's efforts to create a more just and equitable place to \\nlive. I cannot and will not take that history and impact for granted.\\n  Although we have come so far because of her sacrifices and the \\nsacrifices of other heroes during the civil rights era, there is so \\nmuch work to be done. Even with the number of accolades given to her, \\nthe best way we can honor Ms. Luper is to uphold her legacy through \\ncommitment to justice and equality in the policies that we propose.\\n  She knew that democracy is not a spectator sport. It is our duty as a \\nCongress and as Americans to make good on the constitutional promise of \\nestablishing justice and ensuring domestic tranquility, so we must \\ncontinue to work for an inclusive, equitable place for everyone to live \\nand feel safe, as well as to build an economy where every American has \\nthe opportunity to thrive.\\n  Thank you to the sit-inners, and thank you to Clara Luper for your \\nresilience and for giving us the torch to carry.\\n\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Education', 'Civil Rights', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=992, text=\"  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader and \\nall of those persons in leadership who make it possible for us to have \\nthese opportunities.\\n  I am especially proud to be here tonight because we have two \\nresolutions that will be presented. These two resolutions have been \\npresented before. One is H. Res. 154. This resolution is one that \\nhonors and praises the NAACP, the National Association for the \\nAdvancement of Colored People. The second is H. Res. 155. It is a Black \\nhistory resolution.\\n  It is interesting to note that the NAACP was founded during Black \\nHistory Month. The NAACP was founded February 12, 1909. The NAACP has a \\nproud history, and I will say more about it in just a moment.\\n  Next, I would like to talk for a brief moment about the resolution \\nthat we have for Black History Month.\\n  Black History Month didn't start out as Black History Month. The \\nHonorable Carter G. Woodson initiated what was called Negro History \\nWeek. Negro History Week was a time for us to acknowledge the \\naccomplishments of African Americans, at that time called Negroes. We \\nhave metamorphosed through many titles, many names, from Negroes to \\nAfrican Americans.\\n  Black History Month was something that Mr. Woodson found to come into \\nbeing in 1976. This was done by President Joe Ford. As it has been \\ndesignated as Black History Month, we have celebrated it as such across \\nthe length and breadth of this Nation.\\n  Carter G. Woodson was a person with great vision. He obviously knew \\nthat in 1926, when this was initially brought to the attention of the \\npublic, there was not a good likelihood that you would be able to have \\na Black History Month. But he knew that, if you can start someplace, \\nyou might finish in a greater place. So he started in 1926 with Black \\nHistory Week, and it has metamorphosed into a month.\\n  You and I know that every day is a day that we should celebrate all \\nhistory, and Black history is no exception. I am not a person who \\nbelieves that we should have Black History Month forever. I think that \\nBlack history, properly incorporated and celebrated within American \\nhistory and world history, would be more than enough. But today, we are \\nhonored to celebrate Black History Month and the NAACP as an \\norganization that was founded during Black History Month.\\n  I would like to say just a few words about this NAACP resolution in \\nterms of the first time we brought it to the floor of the Congress of \\nthe United States of America.\\n  When we brought it to the floor the very first time, the cosponsor of \\nthe resolution was Mr. Henry Hyde, and the person who controlled the \\ntime was Mr. Jim Sensenbrenner. Mr. Sensenbrenner, at that time, was \\nthe chairperson of the Judiciary Committee. I recall Mr. Sensenbrenner \\nstanding\\n\\n\\nover to my right and making his commentary about the NAACP. He spoke \\nwith a degree of fervor that I thought was needed at the time.\\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner, while he brought it to the floor and did direct \\nthe traffic, I would note that it was not an easy resolution to get \\npast the House of Representatives. It did pass with consent of the \\nHouse. It was agreed to, if you will.\\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Hyde had a difficult time getting it \\nthrough the House. I am proud that they did, and I am pleased that none \\nof the Members at that time voiced objections to the resolution being \\nagreed to. Mr. Sensenbrenner I will always remember as a person who was \\na champion for this resolution, and Mr. Hyde was the cosponsor of the \\nNAACP resolution.\\n\\n  The NAACP is celebrating its 110th anniversary. This is probably the \\nNation's oldest and best known civil rights organization, founded on \\nFebruary 12 of 1909, the date of the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's \\nbirth, the centennial of his birth.\\n  It is interesting to note that Black History Month was considered \\nbecause of Abraham Lincoln's birth as well, so the two resolutions have \\nthis in common, Black History Month and the NAACP's being celebrated \\nand recognized today.\\n  It was founded by a diverse group of persons who were outstanding \\ncitizens. I would also add that it was not founded by a group of \\npersons all of whom were African American. I will call off the names \\nfor you to give you some indication.\\n  Ida Wells-Barnett, the well-known W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry Moscowitz, \\nMary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William English \\nWalling--all persons who were founders of the NAACP.\\n  The NAACP, for the early part of its history, had a minority of \\nminorities, meaning African Americans were not the dominant force \\nwithin its leadership. They had persons who were carrying the torch of \\nfreedom such that African Americans could be a part of it. But it is \\ninteresting to note that, early on, the leadership was predominantly \\nAnglo persons.\\n  The NAACP, as indicated, is the oldest, largest, and most widely \\nrecognized grassroots-based civil rights organization in the United \\nStates. The active membership is in all 50 States, including State \\nconferences of branches and local branches, as well as branches in \\nprisons and chapters on college campuses and high schools throughout \\nthe Nation.\\n  The NAACP has its national headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland.\\n  The NAACP is here to ensure the political, educational, social, and \\neconomic rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and \\nracial discrimination.\\n  The NAACP is committed to achieving its goals through nonviolence, \\nincluding negotiation, litigation, and protestation.\\n  The NAACP is well known for its litigation. The Honorable Thurgood \\nMarshall, an African American to become Supreme Court Justice, was the \\nchief litigator for the NAACP. Under his leadership, with the \\nassistance of a good many other people, the NAACP was able to win many \\nlawsuits before the Supreme Court. The lawsuit Brown v. Board of \\nEducation is one of the most notable lawsuits that the NAACP \\nchampioned.\\n  The NAACP has used political pressure, marches, demonstrations, and \\neffective lobbying to secure the voice for those who are considered \\nvoiceless in the United States of America.\\n  The NAACP has been fighting segregation in public schools under the \\nleadership of Thurgood Marshall, as I indicated earlier, and its \\ngreatest victories, of course, include, as I indicated, Brown v. Board \\nof Education.\\n  The NAACP, in 2005, launched the Disaster Relief Fund to help \\nhurricane survivors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and \\nAlabama to rebuild their lives.\\n  So the organization has metamorphosed into one that does more than \\nchampion the causes of civil rights as they relate to persons being \\ndiscriminated against. It also champions the causes of those who are \\namong the least, the last, and the lost in our society: persons who \\nhave been locked out, persons who have been left behind, persons who \\nbut for the NAACP might not have a voice.\\n  I was very honored to be a part of the NAACP's disaster relief help. \\nI am also honored to have been a branch president of the NAACP in \\nHouston, Texas.\\n  The NAACP was instrumental in the enactment of the Matthew Shepard \\nand James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which generally and \\ngreatly expanded the legal definition of a hate crime. This was an \\nimportant piece of legislation. I was honored to be here at the time we \\ntook up the legislation.\\n  Hate crimes are still crimes that we have to not only acknowledge \\nexist, but the law ought to have consequences for persons who commit \\nthese dastardly deeds.\\n  Throughout its existence, the NAACP has led the charge to defend the \\nconstitutional right to vote. That is an important piece of commentary, \\nthe right to vote. The NAACP is still a part of the effort to assure \\nevery person the right to vote in this country.\\n  The NAACP has taken on the challenge of dealing with the photo IDs \\nthat are required in an insidious way. It has also taken on the \\nchallenge of making sure that persons are properly registered so that \\nthey can vote, and also making sure that those who would thwart the \\nefforts to register persons to vote are not successful in doing so.\\n  The NAACP has led the effort to strengthen the Voting Rights Act and \\nto protect the principle of one person, one vote. The NAACP led the \\ncharge in raising awareness about and challenging voter suppression \\nlaws in Federal courts across the Nation.\\n  The NAACP board of directors unanimously elected Derrick Johnson as \\nits President and CEO, who is doing an outstanding job. I am proud to \\nbe associated with him and the endeavors.\\n  I am a proud member of the NAACP. I have been such for a good deal of \\nmy life. I am honored to have a life membership, to have a golden \\nheritage membership, and to have a diamond membership.\\n  I believe those of us who have benefited from the NAACP ought to be \\nmembers of the organization that has made it possible for us to have \\nmany of the opportunities that we have. I always acknowledge my \\nmembership in the organization, and I encourage others to do so who \\nhappen to be members as well: the NAACP, a proud organization that we \\ncelebrate during this Black History Month.\\n  The Black history resolution covers more than the NAACP. It talks \\nabout Black migrations. It emphasizes the movement of people of African \\ndescent to new destinations and new social realities. This focuses on, \\nprimarily, the migration of African Americans in this country. It \\nfocuses specifically on the 20th century through today.\\n  It deals with patterns of movement, including the relocation of \\npersons of African ancestry from Southern farms to Southern cities; \\nfrom the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West; and from the \\nCaribbean to the United States. Black people have been in motion in the \\n20th century and up to this date, and this resolution acknowledges \\nthis.\\n\\n\\n  It also talks about the interactions with law enforcement that often \\nresult in some ugly circumstances, imprisonment and convict leasing.\\n  Convict leasing is something that we should give a little bit more \\nemphasis to.\\n  In the State of Texas, we recently discovered a grave site containing \\n95 bodies. These 95 bodies were of persons who were victims of the \\nState's law that allowed convict leasing.\\n  Many times persons were charged with minor offenses and while they \\nwere incarcerated, they could be leased to private parties for the \\npurpose of having them work as convicts. And many times--too often, I \\nmight add--the persons who were leased out, were not treated properly. \\nIn fact, they were treated poorly.\\n  Many times they were not given proper food, proper clothing, and \\nproper shelter; and as a result, many of them died at an early age. In \\nthis grave of 95 persons, there are persons who were thought to have \\nbeen teenagers at the time of that death.\\n  We are not absolutely sure they were all African Americans, but the \\nsuspicion is that a good many of them were. Some of them were likely to \\nhave been Anglos as well.\\n  After finding their bodies in Sugar Land, Texas, on the site of a \\nschool,\\n\\n\\nschool property, the bodies were exhumed, and they were to be relocated \\nto another place. And in so doing, a good many of the citizens, the \\nactivist community, decided that this was an inappropriate thing to \\ndo--the bodies being exhumed and reinterred at another location.\\n  There was a serious meeting before the school board. And the school \\nboard and the county commissioners, the commissioners court decided \\nthat it would be appropriate to further study the possibility of \\ninhuming these bodies in the place where they were exhumed.\\n  And my hope is we would follow through on this and give them not only \\na burial site with a proper plaque to memorialize their being in this \\nplace, but also to do a little bit more and have some sort of structure \\nor facility that would allow persons to acquire intelligence about what \\nactually happened to these people, how they lived, and how they died, \\nand why.\\n  This country has come a long way, but, of course, we still have much \\nmore to do. But we want to make sure that we do not overlook the \\nhistory associated with persons who were leased as convicts to private \\npersons for the purpose of performing work for them.\\n  This migration that I spoke of earlier, known as the Great Migration, \\nwas caused by a lack of economic opportunities because of harsh \\nsegregation laws in the south and because of the terror that was \\nperpetrated against African American communities by the KKK.\\n  The KKK, obviously, was active in the south; and the KKK, obviously, \\nwas in the business of terrorizing African American persons. And it is \\ninteresting to note that while this House has condemned a good many \\npersons for their activities, I have not been able to find a record \\nshowing that the KKK has been condemned for its activities by way of a \\nresolution that actually focuses on a person who has been associated \\nwith that organization.\\n  The KKK has a horrible history in this country, and it is my hope \\nthat we in the House of Representatives will take up a resolution \\ncondemning this entity for what it has done.\\n  I plan to bring such a resolution to the attention of the House.\\n  This resolution on black history indicates that prior to 1910; more \\nthan 90 percent of African Americans lived in the south. And by the \\n1970s, 47 percent of all African Americans were living in the north and \\nin the west.\\n  This is why it is called the Great Migration. When you have this much \\nof a population moving for opportunities, moving for reasons associated \\nwith concern for their well-being, that is a significant migration.\\n  And during World War I, when slowing immigration from Europe created \\na labor shortage in the north, companies began recruiting African \\nAmericans to fill the assembly lines, to work in steel mills and \\nrailroads and factories. It was not unusual to hear persons talk about \\n``going up north,'' going up north so that they could have \\nopportunities in the north that they were unable to acquire in the \\nsouth.\\n  African Americans who migrated to the north still faced racial \\ndiscrimination in the form of redlining, in the form of racially based \\nhousing ordinances, in the form of higher rent based on race, and for \\nthe resurgence of the KKK, and the rising instances of race riots.\\n  African Americans were not always welcomed with open arms when they \\nsought to migrate to these new destinations.\\n  African Americans created their own cities and neighborhoods, free of \\ndiscrimination, where their culture expanded.\\n  For example, in Harlem, New York City, that housed over 200,000 \\nAfrican Americans, there was a culture that was created there in \\nHarlem. And we are proud to say that that culture still exists. Harlem \\nhas been a very important part of African American history.\\n  Efforts were made to provide educational opportunities for African \\nAmericans, including the founding of what is now North Carolina Central \\nUniversity.\\n  Greenwood, Oklahoma, is another part of the history that we ought to \\nacknowledge. It was a part of Tulsa, and became the home of a thriving \\nblack business--a section also known as Black Wall Street--until the \\nTulsa riot of 1921, in which a white mob literally burned down \\nGreenwood.\\n  U.S. history has some parts of it that we are not proud of, but we do \\nhave to acknowledge.\\n  In Houston, Texas, there is an area known as Freedmen's Town. And \\nfreed slaves were given the opportunity to purchase land and build \\ntheir homes along the bayou, known as Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas. \\nAnd this was at the end of the Civil War.\\n  And over six decades, the town thrived with churches and schools and \\nstores and theaters and jazz spots--clubs, if you will. This was a \\nthriving area dominated by African Americans.\\n\\n  I would also like to mention another personality;\\n  Judge Frank M. Johnson, who was said to be one of the most courageous \\njudges ever to occupy a Federal bench; he was a part of the effort to \\nintegrate the south. There are many people who have praised him, \\nincluding Dr. Martin Luther King.\\n  He is the person who issued the order to require the constabulary to \\nallow the marches to proceed across the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they \\nmarched from Selma to Montgomery.\\n  He is the person who filed the order--along with the other judges--to \\nintegrate the bus line, that was called the Montgomery bus boycott. He \\nopened the doors to persons of all hues, especially those of African \\nancestry who had been locked out.\\n  Frank M. Johnson will ever be remembered as a champion of human \\nrights. In fact, he will also be remembered as a person who did it \\nunder adverse circumstances, because he had to have, for many years, \\n24-hour security. His mother's home was torched at one time.\\n  It was not easy to be on the side of African Americans in the early \\npart of history.\\n  Frank M. Johnson took such a stand.\\n  We would also recognize Senator Edward Brooke, III, who became the \\nfirst African American popularly elected to the United States Senate.\\n  He was from Massachusetts, and he served there for many years. He was \\nthe first attorney general of African ancestry in any state.\\n  In 1962, he cowrote the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited \\ndiscrimination in housing. He was the first Republican to call for \\nPresident Nixon's resignation in light of the Watergate scandal.\\n  The history of African Americans in the north is one that is rich; \\nthe history in the south is one that is rich; but they all started, to \\na greater extent, with a migration that proceeded from the south to \\nmany destinations in the north, as well as in the west.\\n  So today, we have a resolution that encourages the continued spread \\nof knowledge regarding black history, and that it not be limited to one \\nmonth, but that we do this throughout the entire year.\\n  I am so honored that my colleagues have signed on to this resolution. \\nWe have had more than 60 colleagues to sign on to one, and I would hope \\nthat as we continue to present these resolutions, we will have more \\npersons who will find favor with them.\\n  In closing, simply this: The success that we have had as African \\nAmericans--if we look closely at our history--we will find that it was \\nnot something that was acquired by our own efforts alone.\\n  Of course, we have done our part to extricate ourselves from some \\ncircumstances that were indeed unpleasant and very harmful and hurtful, \\nbut there were other persons who were there to be of assistance and \\nhelp.\\n  Many of the stations at the Underground Railroad had persons who were \\nnot of African ancestry that were there for us as we were traversing \\nour way to freedom.\\n  In many of the battles that were fought in the courtrooms, there were \\npersons who were funding the litigation that were not of African \\nancestry.\\n  The Spingarn brothers are such persons. The NAACP awards its highest \\nmedal annually in the name of the Spingarns.\\n  When we have had few people to stand with us, the Jewish community \\nhas been there. When we have had few people to stand with us, the LGBTQ \\ncommunity has been there. When we have had few to stand with us, we \\nhave had persons of all stripes; Muslims have been there; persons of \\nall faiths have been there.\\n\\n\\n  At the March on Washington, if you take a close look at that march, \\nyou will see persons of many hues, many stripes, persons from many \\nwalks of life.\\n  So we are here today, proud to be here in the well of the Congress of \\nthe United States of America, but we understand that we didn't get here \\nby ourselves, and we are proud to celebrate black history. But we are \\nalso proud to acknowledge that black history includes the history of a \\nlot of persons who were associated with our efforts to acquire our \\nfreedom, our liberty, and the opportunities that we enjoy today.\\n  Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for the time, and I proudly \\nyield back the time such that you may continue with the business of the \\nHouse.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Civil Rights', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=1008, text=\"  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about climate \\nchange and about our climate crisis.\\n  Climate change is an existential threat to our country and the \\nplanet. We know this because the world's leading scientists--the United \\nNations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--just made that very \\nwarning last year. The U.N. report told us that we have very limited \\ntime until we are past the point of no return and the most catastrophic \\nimpacts of climate change are irreversible. Our own Federal scientists \\nacross 13 Agencies also just warned in the ``National Climate \\nAssessment'' that the impacts of climate change are not in the future \\nbut are happening in our communities right now. Here is what all 13 \\nFederal Agencies said: ``Our efforts do not yet approach the scale \\nnecessary to avoid substantial damages to the economy, environment, and \\nhuman health.''\\n  These are Earth-shattering reports about the state of our Earth. \\nThese are the doomsday reports about what will happen if we do not take \\nbold action.\\n  The consequences of climate change will be dire: a tenfold increase \\nin ice-free summers in the Arctic, a 99-percent loss of coral reefs, \\nand a doubling of species lost around the world. In worst-case \\nscenarios in the Northeast, by the end of the century, both the \\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and Logan Airport will be \\nunderwater. Climate emissions are not slowing down. In 2018, greenhouse \\ngas emissions in the United States increased by 2.8 percent. We have a \\ndenier-in-chief in the White House.\\n  This week, Republicans in the Senate are poised to confirm a coal \\nlobbyist to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is \\nunbelievable that we will confirm a coal lobbyist to be the head of our \\nenvironment in our country. Andrew Wheeler's denial of the climate \\ncrisis should in and of itself be disqualifying. His record as a coal \\nlobbyist should be disqualifying.\\n  We should come together and reject Andrew Wheeler as the next head of \\nthe Environmental Protection Agency. The impact of climate change on \\nordinary families, on their health, on our Nation, on our security, and \\non our future is too urgent.\\n  The United Nations tells us that climate change is an existential \\nthreat to the planet. It is the national security, health, economic, \\nand moral issue of our time--of all time. We have a responsibility to \\nact. We must be bold. We must be ambitious. That is why I have \\nintroduced the Green New Deal resolution, because it lays out a \\nserious, bold, and aspirational set of goals\\n\\n\\nthat meet the scale of the threat. It is a set of principles and not \\nprescriptions. It challenges this country to find solutions to this \\nproblem.\\n  The Green New Deal is a climate plan about net-zero emissions. The \\nRepublican climate plan is in zero existence. They don't have a climate \\nplan. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal because they don't like \\na functional government. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal \\nbecause they don't like climate science. Republicans don't like the \\nGreen New Deal because their allies--the oil companies, the coal \\ncompanies, and the corporate polluters--don't like wind power or solar \\npower or all-electric vehicles or the millions of blue-collar jobs they \\ncan create. We can save all of creation by engaging in massive blue-\\ncollar job creation in this country. Republicans don't like the Green \\nNew Deal because clean energy is a direct threat to the interests and \\nthe bottom line of Big Oil and King Coal.\\n  The Green New Deal isn't just a socialist manifesto. It isn't pie in \\nthe sky. It isn't a takeover. It isn't any of the misinformation and \\ndistortions that Republicans and their fossil fuel allies have called \\nit. The Green New Deal isn't, as the Republican leader called it this \\nmorning, ``the far left's Santa Claus wish list dressed up to look like \\nserious policy.'' If it were, then Republicans in this Chamber wouldn't \\ncare enough about it to spend their entire morning remarks on it, and \\nthe majority leader wouldn't be threatening to bring it to the floor \\nwithout any hearings, without any expert testimony, without any \\namendments, and without any science.\\n  Let's have the debate. Let's have the hearings. Let's bring in all \\nthe experts. Let's let the U.N. testify. Let's let our own scientists \\nand every one of the Federal Agencies in America testify. Let's bring \\nin all of the corporate executives right now on wind, solar, all-\\nelectric vehicles, and storage batteries in our society. Bring them in. \\nLet's hear the stories. Instead, what we have is just an attempt to \\nshort-circuit the debate.\\n  They may not believe climate change is an existential threat to human \\nkind, but they are smart enough to know that the bold goals of the \\nGreen New Deal are an existential threat to the Koch brothers and all \\nof their other corporate polluter and fossil fuel allies.\\n  Let me just read some of what is in the Green New Deal that \\nRepublicans are opposed to: securing for all people of the United \\nStates for generations to come clean air and water, climate and \\ncommunity resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable \\nenvironment.\\n  Are Republicans opposed to access to nature? That is in the \\nresolution. Are Republicans opposed to clean air and water? That is in \\nthe resolution too. Do you know what is not in the resolution? Ending \\nairline travel. Do you know what is not in the resolution? No more \\ncows.\\n  Do you know what is not in the resolution? A prohibition on nuclear \\nenergy or carbon capture and sequestration. The Green New Deal \\nresolution is bold, and it is aspirational in its principles, but it is \\nnot prescriptive in its policies.\\n  Let's look at some of what is actually in this resolution: to create \\nmillions of good, high-wage jobs--I guess Republicans don't believe in \\nthat; to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States \\nto sustainably meet the challenge of the 21st century--I guess \\nRepublicans don't believe in that; guaranteeing universal access to \\nclean water, supporting family farming, cleaning up existing hazardous \\nwaste and abandoned sites, ensuring economic development and \\nsustainability on those sites--I guess Republicans don't believe in \\nthose either. Those are all part of the Green New Deal and climate \\nsolutions.\\n  We already know that Big Oil and King Coal and other fossil fuel \\ncompanies don't want to compete with clean energy because that is a \\ndirect threat to their business plan.\\n  Clean energy makes the air we breathe cleaner, it saves consumers \\nmoney, it makes us safer, and it creates jobs.\\n  In his remarks, the Republican leader called the Green New Deal \\n``foolish and dangerous.'' With all due respect to the leader and my \\nRepublican colleagues, the only foolish and dangerous thing about the \\nGreen New Deal is to ignore the $400 billion in damage to our country \\nover the last 2 years from supercharged storms and wildfires all over \\nCalifornia and all over the West.\\n  To ignore the tens of trillions of dollars in damages we will see \\nfrom climate change in the United States by 2100 is something that \\nultimately, from my perspective, is foolish and dangerous. An ounce of \\nprevention is better than a pound of cure. Ignoring what is happening, \\nignoring the warnings from all of the top scientists in the world and \\nin the United States and continuing on the same pathway--that is \\nfoolish, that is dangerous, and that is going to cost us tens of \\ntrillions of dollars in damages that would have been otherwise avoided \\nif we unleashed a technology revolution in our country that would \\ncreate millions of new jobs.\\n  It is also dangerous to send our men and women in the military \\noverseas to protect tankers of oil coming from the Middle East to the \\nUnited States. We are still bringing in oil from Saudi Arabia. We are \\nstill bringing in oil from other countries in the Middle East. What if \\nwe could dramatically increase the fuel economy in the vehicles we \\ndrive? What if we could accelerate the pace to use all-electric \\nvehicles? Wouldn't it be great if we could say that the day arrived \\nwhen we never have to see another tanker of oil from the Middle East \\ncoming into our country? Would that not make us safer? Would that not \\ngive us better control of our own foreign policy and where we send \\nyoung men and women in uniform? I think it would.\\n  I think it would be foolish and dangerous not to take that pathway. \\nThe superstorms, the wildfires, the rising seas, and the other extreme \\nweather events--the impacts of climate change if we do not act boldly \\nto stop it--that isn't just dangerous; that is an existential threat. \\nThat is what the world's scientists have called it.\\n  The Green New Deal is dangerous for the status quo of doing nothing \\non climate change. It is dangerous for the Koch brothers and those who \\nare used to killing off every climate debate before it gets a chance to \\nstart. It is dangerous for those who want us to limp into a frightening \\nfuture with no plan and no protections in place. It is dangerous for \\nthose who benefit from the continued devaluation of our workers, the \\nhistoric oppression of vulnerable communities, and from the continued \\ndestruction of the environment. Those are the ones who would think the \\nGreen New Deal is dangerous.\\n  We want to support working families and support a safe climate future \\nwhere all communities are protected. We welcome a debate on proposals \\nfor how to get there, but the science is clear as to where we need to \\nend up.\\n  The Republicans may think that the Green New Deal is just a \\nresolution, but it is a revolution. It is a revolution. Young people \\nwant a green energy revolution in our country. They know we can do \\nthis. They know that all of these new technologies can be invented; all \\nof these new technologies can be deployed.\\n  It is not just a resolution; it is a revolution. All across this \\ncountry, when the Republicans have refused to bring their climate plan \\nout there because theirs is a party of science denial--the President is \\nthe ``Denier in Chief'' on climate science--then we are going to allow \\nthis problem to worsen and worsen and worsen.\\n  Do you know who should know best? Donald Trump, because within 30 \\nyears, according to the science, Mar-a-Lago is going to become Mar-a-\\nLagoon. It is right on the coast. It has already begun to happen. It is \\njust going to continue.\\n  The President might be able to protect his property, but we are going \\nto lose tens of trillions of dollars for the properties of other \\nAmericans because he decided that he was going to deny the warning that \\nthe scientists have presented to us.\\n  When I was a boy, lying on the rug, looking at President Kennedy on \\nthe television, he challenged our country to send a mission to the Moon \\nand to return that mission safely to the United States within 10 years.\\n  When he gave that speech at Rice University, he made very clear in \\nthe speech that we would have to invent new metal alloys that did not \\nexist. We would have to invent new transmission systems that did not \\nexist, that we would have to return that mission safely from the Moon \\nthrough heat half the\\n\\n\\nintensity of the Sun. We would have to complete it within 10 years, and \\nwe would have to do it not because it was easy but because it was hard. \\nWe had to be bold.\\n  Because the challenge from the Soviet Union was so great, the United \\nStates did not have an option. Failure was not an option, and we \\ncompleted that mission.\\n  Well, the same thing is true here for a Green New Deal. Failure is \\nnot an option. The consequences will be catastrophic for our planet and \\nfor the United States of America, and the solution is to unleash this \\ngreen energy job-creation engine. We now have 350,000 solar and wind \\nworkers in the United States. It is up from almost nothing in 2008. It \\nhas already happened over 10 years.\\n  We had only 1,000 megawatts of solar in our country in 2008. We now \\nhave 62,000 megawatts of solar.\\n  We had only 25,000 megawatts of wind. We now have 98,000 megawatts of \\nwind.\\n  We had only 2,000 all-electric vehicles in our country in 2008. We \\nnow have a million, and between Tesla and all of the other companies, \\nthey are going to sell 500,000 just this year in our country. They have \\ninvented new metals. They have invented new battery systems. They have \\ninvented new propulsion systems in order to solve those problems, but \\nwe still have a long way to go.\\n  It is imperative that we put the tax breaks for wind and solar, for \\nall electric vehicles, for batteries on the books and make them \\npermanent because this problem is going to be solved only if we can \\nconvince the smartest young people in our country that all of the \\nincentives, all of the policies are there and that their country has \\ntheir back and wants them to solve the problem in the same way that our \\nwhole country had the back of NASA in the 1960s. If we do that, we will \\nbe successful. There is no question about it in my mind.\\n  I am a technological optimist, and I hate the pessimism of the other \\nside. I hate this ``can't do'' mentality that they have, especially \\ngiven what has happened in the last 10 years in electric vehicles and \\nwind, solar, and storage technology breakthroughs. It is just really \\nsad to hear this.\\n  I think, ultimately, something is rising up across this country. \\nYoung people, especially, know it is time for the revolution. They know \\nit is time to close the door on this era where all we do is \\nindiscriminately use the atmosphere as a sewer for all of this carbon \\nand all of these greenhouse gases.\\n  I am very confident that one way or another this body will start to \\nact or it is going to become one of the top two or three election \\nissues in 2020 because this generation knows that the planet is running \\na fever. There are no emergency rooms on planets, and it is going to \\ntake action in this body in order to put the policies in place, in \\norder to preserve this planet and hand it on better than we found it.\\n  The challenge is great. The Green New Deal sets the framework for \\nlaying out how serious the problem is and how bold the action has to be \\nto deal with that serious problem for our planet.\\n  If we do it right, I think future generations will look back on ours \\nin the same way we now look back on President Kennedy and that \\ngeneration, and they will know that they discharged their historic \\nresponsibility to our country and to the planet.\\n  With that, I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1013, text=\"  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, in many ways, Andrew Wheeler is a perfect \\nexample of a Cabinet appointment in the Trump era--conflicted, \\nunethical, and hostile to the mission of the Agency he was nominated to \\nlead.\\n  He shouldn't have been confirmed to this position as Deputy \\nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, and he \\ncertainly shouldn't be confirmed to lead the Agency on a permanent \\nbasis.\\n  Prior to his service at EPA, Mr. Wheeler spent 8 years lobbying for \\nmany of the special interests that he is targeted or charged with \\nregulating. For example, in his work for Murray Energy, whose \\npresident, Robert Murray, was among the largest donors to Donald \\nTrump's 2016 campaign, Mr. Wheeler worked to kill a rule that would \\nhave prevented coal companies from dumping mining waste into American \\nstreams and waterways.\\n  As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Mr. Wheeler also fought tooth and \\nnail against President Obama's Clean Power Plan, a forward-looking \\ninitiative that would have substantially reduced carbon emissions from \\npower generation.\\n  Mr. Wheeler's client, Robert Murray, was present front and center as \\nformer EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed an Executive order to \\nbegin the process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan. I don't think \\nthat was a coincidence.\\n  After Mr. Wheeler's confirmation as the EPA's Deputy Administrator, \\nhe assured Bloomberg News in June 2018: ``If I lobbied on something, I \\ndon't think it's appropriate for me to participate [in policymaking].''\\n  Of course, he was lobbying on a lot of things for years. In fact, Mr. \\nWheeler participated in meetings with three former clients with \\ninterests before the EPA. Holding these meetings with former clients is \\na clear conflict of interest and ethical lapse. Andrew Wheeler fits \\nright in with Donald Trump's version of ``draining the swamp,'' which \\nis more like ``come on in, the water's fine.''\\n  We have already had one EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, resign in \\ndisgrace over ethical lapses and potentially illegal behavior in \\noffice. We don't need another.\\n  Mr. Wheeler's work at the EPA is also consistent with the hostility \\nof Trump Cabinet officials to the core mission of the Department or the \\nAgency that they are appointed to lead.\\n  The EPA is the primary Agency charged with safeguarding the \\nenvironment and protecting public health from dangerous and toxic \\nchemicals. At its core, the EPA is tasked with making sure we have safe \\nair to breathe and clean water to drink.\\n  Yet, during his time as Deputy Administrator, Mr. Wheeler has \\nchampioned a deregulatory agenda that fundamentally undermines the \\nEPA's core mission. Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has \\nproposed undermining the legal authority of the mercury and air toxics \\nstandard to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air emissions \\nfrom coal and oil burning powerplants.\\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, mercury exposure can \\ndamage the nervous, digestive, and immune systems and is a serious \\nthreat to child development. The EPA's current efforts to reverse these \\nemission standards, in place since 2012, come after utilities across \\nthe country had already invested resources in reducing mercury \\nemissions by 90 percent.\\n  Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the Trump administration has also \\nproposed a dramatic weakening of fuel economy and greenhouse gas \\nemissions standards for cars. Their proposed rule would increase air \\npollution from vehicles and would result in Hawaii families ending up \\npaying thousands more dollars for gasoline to fill less efficient \\ncars. Through his opposition to the Clean Power Plan and his efforts to \\nrepeal it at the EPA, Mr. Wheeler serves as a primary architect of the \\nTrump administration's assault on climate science and their refusal to \\nact decisively against climate change. This assault can also be seen in \\na new proposed rule from the EPA that would exclude rigorous, peer-\\nreviewed scientific studies under the guise of promoting scientific \\ntransparency.\\n\\n  At first glance, the rule sounds like something everyone should \\nsupport, but like so many initiatives proposed by this administration, \\nthe rule's true intent is much more sinister.\\n  Insisting that policymaking rely only on studies that make all of \\ntheir data public would exclude studies that rely on confidential \\nmedical information that by law cannot be made public. Limiting the \\nfactual basis on which the EPA can make decisions in this manner would \\nhave a catastrophic impact on public health.\\n  If this rule had been in effect in 1993, the ``Six Cities'' study by \\nthe Harvard\\n\\n\\nSchool of Public Health would never have transformed the way we \\nregulate air pollution in this country. The study showed that Americans \\nliving in cities with more air pollution have shorter lifespans than \\nAmericans living in cities with less air pollution.\\n  Using confidential medical information, the study conclusively \\ndemonstrated that fine particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 \\nmicrons is exceptionally deadly to human beings. These findings, which \\nhave been backed up in subsequent studies, provide the basis for cost-\\nbenefit analyses done by EPA for future rules regulating air pollution. \\nUndermining this kind of evidence-based policymaking would give \\nindustry the green light to pollute with fewer consequences.\\n  This proposed rule is consistent with an administration-wide effort \\nto promote ignorance in the face of the real threat climate change \\nposes to national security, public health, and public safety.\\n  Climate change is an issue where ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is \\ndangerous. The President's own top security officials agree. Director \\nof National Intelligence Dan Coats, for example, issued a new worldwide \\nthreat that concluded that ``climate hazards'' like extreme weather, \\nwildfires, droughts, and acidifying oceans are, ``threatening \\ninfrastructure, health and water and food security.''\\n  In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis told the Senate Armed \\nServices Committee that ``climate change is impacting stability in \\nareas of the world where our troops are operating.'' He went on to say \\nthat ``climate change is a challenge that requires a broader whole-of-\\ngovernment government response.''\\n  Instead of accepting the conclusions of his top national security \\nofficials, Donald Trump is following the recommendation of William \\nHapper, a notorious climate denier and now a Senior Director on the \\nNSC, to establish a new Presidential Committee on Climate Security.\\n  Dr. Happer is particularly notorious for his assertion that ``the \\ndemonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the \\npoor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the \\nworld, and so are the Jews.\\n  Anyone who makes this kind of outrageous analogy should not be \\nentrusted to lead anything on climate security, in my view.\\n  No one should doubt that the President and Dr. Happer have a \\npreordained outcome in mind. They want to legitimize ignorance and \\ndenial of climate change and abandon tens of millions of Americans to \\nthe disastrous impacts of climate change in the coming decades.\\n  I repeat, with climate change, ignorance is not bliss. It is \\ndangerous. It is dangerous for a State like Hawaii that would be the \\nhardest hit by the impact of climate change. With extreme weather, \\nocean acidification, coral bleaching, and rising seas, climate change \\nposes an existential threat to our State. It is one of the reasons \\nHawaii has implemented some of the most ambitious and aggressive \\npolicies to combat climate change in the country.\\n  Hawaii was the first State to separately ratify the Paris climate \\nagreement and has set an ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral and \\ngenerating 100 percent of our power from renewable sources by 2045. \\nHawaii's ambitious effort to confront climate change and the success we \\nhave already seen in moving toward our goals demonstrate that we can \\nembrace similarly ambitious policies at the national level.\\n  It is one of the reasons I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Green \\nNew Deal--an aspirational effort to transform our economy to combat \\nclimate change.\\n  In the weeks since the plan was introduced, we have endured all kinds \\nof mocking outrage from people who would rather stick their heads in \\nthe sand as science and fact deniers. They paint the Green New Deal as \\nsomething scary and dangerous for the country. What is really scary and \\ndangerous are people like them who deny that climate change is real and \\nrefuse to do anything about it in their steadfast support and alliance \\nwith the fossil fuel industry. History will not be kind to them.\\n  Rejecting the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator \\nof the Environmental Protection Agency, we can take one step forward in \\nthe fight against dangerous ignorance.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",

A month later, on Black Friday, we had the release of \\nthe ``Fourth National Climate Assessment''--the Trump administration's \\n``Fourth National Climate Assessment''--and it concluded that ``Earth's \\nclimate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of \\nmodern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.''\\n  There was a report from the Global Carbon Project that which found \\nthat global carbon emissions are going up. They went up 0.7 percent in \\n2018, hitting a record breaking 37.1 metric tons around the world. That \\nis human activity putting out carbon dioxide that acts as a blanket on \\nthe planet. This isn't some new thought.\\n  We go back to 1959. We had an eminent scientist who became better \\nknown for his work in the nuclear world, but he was asked to address \\nthe 100th anniversary of the petroleum industry. At that speech in \\n1959, he said: The energy you have unleashed and harnessed can do \\ndramatic things to\\n\\n\\nchange the world, but you have a couple of challenges. One challenge is \\nthat there isn't an infinite amount of petroleum in the ground. Another \\nchallenge is it creates carbon dioxide. It doesn't look like a \\npollutant because you can't see it and you can't smell it, but in fact, \\nit traps heat. I think he framed it more scientifically, that it traps \\ninfrared energy.\\n  He said that is going to be a problem, and, of course, we are seeing \\nthat problem all the time now. You don't need these scientific reports \\nout of a global panel or a fourth assessment from the administration to \\ntell us what is going on because we see the facts on the ground.\\n  In my home State of Oregon, you can't move around the State without \\nseeing the impact. In Eastern Oregon, you have the warmer winter. It is \\nnot killing the pine beetles. So the pine beetles are killing the \\ntrees. More pine beetles and less trees is not a good thing.\\n  If you are over on the coast, the oyster men will tell you they had a \\nbig crisis in 2008 and 2009 because all of the baby oysters were dying, \\nnot because of a bacteria but because the acidity in the Pacific Ocean \\nhas gone up. How is that related? Because carbon dioxide is absorbed by \\nthe ocean and becomes carbonic acid. We burn so much carbon dioxide \\nthat we changed the acidity of the ocean. Can you imagine that is \\npossible? It seems impossible, but it speaks to how much carbon dioxide \\nwe released within a few decades of human civilization on this planet.\\n  You can keep going on with this story around Oregon. Our kelp beds \\nare disappearing. They provide protection for all kinds of fish \\nspecies. The kelp are dying because the blue sea urchins are eating \\nthem. The blue sea urchins are expanding rapidly because the starfish \\nare dying because the ocean got too warm for them. It is one story \\nafter another. There is less irrigation water, less snowpack, warmer \\nstreams, and harsher conditions for trout and salmon all within the \\nState of Oregon, and there are similar stories throughout our Nation.\\n  Perhaps the most destructive factor, though, has been the increased \\nnumber of forest fires. There are bigger fires, hotter fires, and a \\nlonger fire season. They are not just ravaging our forests but \\nproducing smoke that has a huge impact on our towns. We take a lot of \\npride in our wine in Oregon, and a lot of our grapes had smoke taint \\nand weren't usable this last year.\\n  We have towns where furniture salesmen said they couldn't sell the \\nfurniture because it had the lingering smell of smoke.\\n  It had an impact on the entertainment world. The Shakespeare Festival \\nhad to shut down and partially move inside to smaller venues, which is \\nhaving a huge impact on their finances and a huge impact on the tourism \\nattraction.\\n  This stuff is real. It is why we should all be here, Democrats and \\nRepublicans, talking about the challenge and saying: What higher \\ncalling is there in our life than to come together to discuss this \\nhonestly and to work together to find solutions?\\n  This isn't something where we can just say that the next generation \\ncan deal with it because the effects are cumulative. They build up. \\nThey become worse. It is a lot worse now than it was 10 years ago, and \\n10 years from now, it will be more so.\\n  There is no easy, fast way to strip the carbon dioxide back out of \\nthe air. We can work at it, but it is not easy. We can plant more \\ntrees, yes, but, meanwhile, those hotter fires are killing more trees. \\nThose pine beetles are killing more trees. In other words, it is \\nurgent. The time to act is now.\\n  In 1988 George H. W. Bush ran for President as an environmentalist. \\nHe announced he was going to take on global warming. His opponent, the \\nDemocrat, ran on the coal industry. That is not the same partisan \\nalliance as you might hear today. George H. W. Bush said: ``Our land, \\nwater and soil support a remarkable range of human activities, but they \\ncan only take so much and we must remember to treat them not as a given \\nbut as a gift.''\\n  Those words should echo in this Chamber. We have other words in this \\nChamber that seem to not address all of the facts that are right in \\nfront of us. One individual said: ``The satellite says it ain't \\nhappening.'' Well, one could probably pick out some one piece of data \\nfrom one satellite somewhere and say it doesn't show the story, but you \\ncollect all the data together and it is happening.\\n  Here is a chart of how the globe is warming over time. It shows the \\ndifference in average temperatures. Here we are with just one tiny \\ncache where there is a significant drop in temperature. There is a \\nlittle bit of white and light blue showing that it stayed about the \\nsame, and there is a whole lot of red saying things are getting a lot \\nworse. That is the collected data. Maybe there is some satellite that \\ntook a picture of one little spot here, but to cherry-pick data like \\nthat is dishonest.\\n  We can't afford to pretend that things are OK when we are facing such \\na dramatic challenge to our blue-green home in the universe. NOAA, or \\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, works at this, and \\nthey record all kinds of data from all around the world.\\n  Here is another chart that shows the Earth's climate record. This one \\nshows the zigs and zags over time. We are going back to 1880, but if we \\nlook from 1880 to 1980, we see a significant rise in the temperature of \\nthe planet. If we go from 1980 until now, it is this absolutely \\nfrightening horror show of increasing temperature. That is what is \\nhappening when we talk about snowpacks. We talk about glaciers, we talk \\nabout coral, we talk about pine beetles, and we talk about 100 of these \\nthings where there is that feedback. All of those affect humans. Those \\naren't just some abstract things, like if a tree falls in the woods but \\nnobody hears it, did it really happen? Did we really hear it? Does it \\nmatter? No.\\n  These reverberate back on our quality of life in this planet, \\nincluding security concerns. The civil war in Syria that produced \\nmillions of refugees trying to get to Europe started with an extended \\ndrought because of the stresses of a warming planet.\\n  Our military weighs in and says that climate chaos accentuates all \\nthe security concerns we have. It creates instability around the world. \\nIf one doesn't want to listen to the scientists, how about if we listen \\nto our own military?\\n  That is what the discussion of Senator Carper's resolution is all \\nabout. That is what the Green New Deal is all about. The Green New Deal \\nsays a few simple things. It says we have a big problem. Check. Yes, we \\ndo. It says we need to take it on boldly and aggressively. Check. Yes, \\nwe do. It says when we take it on boldly, we can create millions of \\njobs, and that will be a good thing for our economy. Check. Yes, it is.\\n  Creating those jobs is good. It says when we do that, we shouldn't \\nleave our frontline communities behind. We should make sure those \\ncommunities--rural communities and inner-city communities that have \\nbeen left behind previously in different economic expansions--can't be \\nleft behind now. Check. That is absolutely right.\\n  Let's make this economic surge benefit everyone in every community, \\nwith special attention to communities that have been struggling.\\n  My colleague is here from Virginia. I am so glad he is. I am talking \\na lot about what is happening on the west coast of America. Perhaps he \\nwill fill us in a little bit on the perspective from the east coast. \\nThis is not one isolated spot on our planet. This is a concern to all \\nof us. We need bipartisan work on this. Some suggest we put a fee on \\ncarbon. Let's have that conversation. Some suggest we provide more \\nsubsidies to renewable energy. Let's have that conversation. Some say \\nwe should do a green workforce--green corps training. Let's talk about \\nthat. Let's talk about every strategy we can bring to bear and come to \\na collective plan because there is no space in the urgency of this \\nissue for us to retreat into blue and red corners. There is no time. It \\nis unacceptable.\\n  I feel it is such a privilege to come to this floor and be part of \\nthis conversation, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do likewise. \\nThere are few issues that threaten us on this scale, but this one does. \\nLet's work together to save our country and save our planet.\\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

This is a special day \\nwhere we will have the chance to recognize the pharmacy industry's many \\ncontributions to the American healthcare system.\\n  Organized by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), \\nthis event will take place on March 5-6, 2019. More than 400 \\nindividuals from all 50 states representing the pharmacy community--\\nincluding practicing pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty and students, \\nstate pharmacy association representatives, and pharmacy company \\nleaders--will be on Capitol Hill. They will visit every House and \\nSenate office to share their views with us about the importance of \\nsupporting their access agenda--legislative priorities that will ensure \\nthat our constituents will continue to have access to more than 40,000 \\ncommunity and neighborhood pharmacies across the country and be better \\nable to utilize pharmacists to improve healthcare quality while \\nreducing the cost of care.\\n  Local pharmacists are important community leaders, who are trusted by \\ntheir patients to efficiently provide high quality, convenient \\nhealthcare services. And as demand for healthcare services continues to \\ngrow, pharmacists are stepping in to fill gaps in healthcare delivery \\nby partnering with physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers \\nto address the unmet need. Moreover, pharmacists continually innovate \\nto provide unique services that improve overall patient health and \\nwellness.\\n  Further, in many communities the local pharmacist is a patient's most \\ndirect healthcare access point. This is particularly true in rural \\nareas. In fact, 91 percent of Americans live within five miles of a \\ncommunity pharmacy. These pharmacies bring value to their communities \\nby providing care to those who need it most--older Americans and those \\nwho manage chronic conditions, particularly in rural and underserved \\nareas. In addition, pharmacists frequently work with patients to \\nnavigate specific pharmacy benefits and the use of generic \\nsubstitutions to identify strategies to save money. Pharmacists also \\nensure medications are administered appropriately, and offer other \\npreventative services that help improve patients overall wellbeing and \\nquality of life.\\n  The pharmacy advocates attending NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill \\nwill be educating members on their access agenda. As we debate the \\nfuture of healthcare, the pharmacy community wishes to work with us to \\nhelp develop solutions that put pharmacy's value to work for patients \\nand payers. Specifically, NACDS's advocates will be seeking our support \\nfor policies that will help address prescription drug affordability and \\ntransparency through much-needed reform to DIR fees, a complicated fee \\nstructure imposed on pharmacies to participate in the Medicare Part D \\nprogram. They will also highlight proposals designed to address the \\nopioid epidemic.\\n  I believe Congress should work with the 2019 NACDS RxIMPACT Day on \\nCapitol Hill advocates to advance policies that support pharmacists in \\ntheir effort to improve care, increase access, and lower costs.\\n\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

The report compares current-law \\nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to \\nin the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is \\nnecessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether \\nbudgetary points of order lie against pending legislation. The \\nRepublican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget \\nOffice, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the \\nCongressional Budget Act, CBA.\\n  This is my second scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can \\nbe found in the Congressional Record for January 10, 2019. The \\ninformation included in this report is current through February 25, \\n2019.\\n  Since my last filing, two bills with significant budgetary effects \\ncleared Congress, the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019, P.L. 116-3, and \\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, P.L. 116-6.\\n  Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables 1-3.\\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \\nexceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays \\nunder the most recently adopted budget resolution and the fiscal year \\n2019 enforceable levels filing. This information is used for enforcing \\ncommittee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Over the \\ncurrent 10-year enforceable window, authorizing committees have \\nincreased outlays by a combined $3.4 billion. For this reporting \\nperiod, as in my last report, 8 of the 16 authorizing committees are \\nnot in compliance with their allocations. Two of these committees, \\nFinance and Judiciary, further exacerbated their violations during this \\nwork period with the passage of Medicaid Extenders and the authorizing \\ndivision, Division H, of the final 2019 appropriations bill, \\nrespectively. For the Finance Committee, P.L. 116-3 was estimated to \\nincrease budget authority over each enforceable period for its \\nallocation, with the largest violation, $120 million, occurring in \\n2019. For the Judiciary Committee, Division H of P.L. 116-6, which \\nincluded various immigration extenders, was estimated to increase \\nbudget authority and outlays by $30 million over the next 10 years.\\n  Table 2 provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on \\nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \\ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \\nspending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations \\nfor fiscal year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the \\nAppropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for fiscal \\nyear 2019. Those limits for regular discretionary spending are $647 \\nbillion for accounts in the defense category and $597 billion for \\naccounts in the nondefense category of spending.\\n  The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order \\nlimiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations \\nbills, CHIMPs. Table 3, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for \\nfiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $15 \\nbillion worth of full-year CHIMPs for fiscal year 2019. The fiscal year \\n2019 CHIMPs were contained in the Labor, Health and Human Services, \\nEducation and Related Agencies division of P.L. 115-245 and the \\nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies division of P.L. 116-\\n6. This information is used for determining the point of order under \\nsection 4102, overall limit, of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.\\n  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican \\nstaff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget \\ntotals approved by Congress.\\n  For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are $2.8 \\nbillion above and $3.3 billion below enforceable levels for budget \\nauthority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $426 million below \\nthe level assumed in the budget resolution. Further, Social Security \\nrevenues are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social \\nSecurity outlays are $4 million above assumed levels for the budget \\nyear.\\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate \\npay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases \\nin fiscal year 2019 of $1,930 million--$427 million revenue loss, \\n$1,503 million outlay increase--over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period \\nof $3,337 million--$894 million revenue loss, $2,443 million outlay \\nincrease--and over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $425 million--\\n$634 million revenue loss, $209 million outlay decrease. During this \\nwork period, one bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, \\nincluded a statutory exemption for the budgetary effects of its \\nDivision H from the Senate's PAYGO scorecard. The Senate's PAYGO rule \\nis enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.\\n  This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget \\nenforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May \\n7, 2018. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were \\nraised.\\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \\nthe Record.\", cat_list={'Social Security & Tax Reform', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Education', 'Homeland Security & Immigration'})\n",

It says, basically, that we want \\nto have a zero-carbon-dioxide emissions by then.\\n  I know there was some discussion in the rolling out of this bill that \\nthat would mean that ground transportation and air transportation would \\neither be eliminated or minimized--at least the way we travel right now \\nwould be. At some point in the future that may happen, but it is highly \\nunlikely it is going to happen in the next 10 years, which is what the \\nbill calls for. Maybe that is why they don't want to debate it. Even \\nPresident Obama's former science adviser says that this is not \\nfeasible. Harvard University professor John Holdren was quoted in the \\nNew York Times saying: ``As a technologist studying this problem for 50 \\nyears, I don't think we can do it.''\\n  So that is a pretty good source who indicates that what we are \\ntalking about here can't happen. So that big headline goal appears to \\nbe impossible, but we probably could debate it anyway. Let's hear from \\nthe other side, particularly the 12 cosponsors, to say why it is \\npossible, why we should be able to do that, and why that is in the \\nlegislation that they filed.\\n  The rest of the legislation goes really beyond things that don't \\nrelate to the environment. There is a laundry list of policies that \\nappear to be popular right now in the so-called progressive discussion. \\nOne is a single-payer health system and the other is a Federal job \\nguarantee. The talking points suggested that that would be a Federal \\njob guarantee for people who can't work or aren't willing to work. Of \\ncourse, that was so controversial that immediately people began to say: \\nWell, maybe that is something that the Republicans snuck into our \\ntalking points. But it turned out that wasn't true.\\n  There is a provision calling for ``repairing the historic oppression \\nof . . . youth.'' That is sort of what this whole Green New Deal seems \\nto focus on--accepting responsibility in a debate for things that \\nreally don't make the kind of sense one would want them to make as you \\nmove toward legislation. They don't really say what the ``historic \\noppression of youth'' was. Probably that is not related to the economy \\nor the environment or the greenness of the Green New Deal.\\n  But even if we agree that these ideas are good ideas, the other \\nquestion is this: How much is it going to cost?\\n  The American Action Forum looked at the biggest parts of the \\nlegislation, and they estimated that the total would run anywhere from \\n$51 trillion to $94 trillion over 10 years. To put this in perspective, \\nthe Congress right now appropriates about $1.5 trillion a year. We \\nspend more than that through programs that are in place like Social \\nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, but we appropriate $1.5 trillion a \\nyear. If the estimates of the Green New Deal are right, that would \\nsuddenly become $5 trillion to $9 trillion a year. That is a pretty \\ngood multiplier of $1.5 trillion a year--six times, in fact, of what we \\nare spending now--at the $9 trillion level. That works out to be about \\n$65,000 per family per year. That would probably be more government \\nthan we could afford, but that is how it works out.\\n  There is nothing that talks about how families are supposed to come \\nup with their share of the bill.\\n  While some of the ideas in the Green New Deal--Medicare for all or a \\njob for everybody, guaranteed by the government--sound like good ideas, \\nI don't think they are going to stand the test of the debate. I think \\nthat is one of the reasons that maybe the other side doesn't want to \\nhave the debate.\\n  Some talk about: Well, maybe we will all vote present or we will not \\nvote at all.\\n  I think it is pretty hard to defend what you are out there talking \\nabout when you are not willing to come to the floor and talk about it. \\nThat is a debate we are going to have. I suspect we are going to have \\nit sometime this month, and I look forward to engaging in that debate.\\n  This week, we are having another debate on nominees. Right now, the \\ndebate is on the nominee for the Administrator of the EPA. There has \\nbeen some discussion of the environment in the debate on the \\nAdministrator of the EPA. Next, we are going to go to someone to serve \\non the TVA commission. This is somebody who has been voted out of \\ncommittee two times in bipartisan voice votes and never allowed to have \\na vote in the Senate.\\n  I will remind my colleagues again that under President Reagan, the \\naverage time in days from when a person was voted out of committee--and \\nremember, as all of us on the floor would know, the committee is where \\nquestions are asked, and the background check has been completed. That \\nmay take a substantial amount of time, depending on the nominee and how \\ncomplicated their information is--sometimes less time, sometimes more. \\nThat has all happened in the committee.\\n  Under President Reagan, the average number of days from the time a \\nperson was voted out of committee until they were voted on, on the \\nfloor was 5. The total number of times the majority had to file cloture \\nto get that vote was less than a handful in the entire first 2 years.\\n  For President Trump, the average number of days for a nominee to be \\nvoted on is 55, and the majority leader had to file cloture 128 times \\neven to get a vote. We are going through some of those votes this week. \\nThe 30 hours of debate almost never includes debate about the nominee \\nwho is using up floor time that could be used for debating how we spend \\nour money, how we defend our country, or what our foreign policy \\noversight responsibilities are going to be.\\n  We are going to continue to look at the options and continue to talk \\nto our friends on the other side about how 60 Senators can work \\ntogether to change the rules in a way that they would be changed going \\nforward to get the rules back more to the days of Ronald Reagan, George \\nHerbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and all of their predecessors, where \\nnominees were never used as a way to use up time. Nominees were never \\nheld hostage so that other legislation or debate couldn't occur.\\n  We are working hard to find 60 of us who want to return to a time \\nwhen legislative priorities in the Senate still had the protections of \\nthe minority that have always been there, but those protections \\ncouldn't be used to the disadvantage of people who have stepped up and \\nare willing to serve and are often voted out of committee on a \\nbipartisan basis, only to be held up on the floor.\\n  I look forward to the debate on the Green New Deal. I look forward to \\nthe other debates we are going to have on the floor of the Senate this \\nyear.\\n  For the people who are willing to serve, who have been reported out \\nof committee, who have been thoroughly questioned and investigated but \\ncan't get that vote and get to work, that is not what we want to do. \\nThat is not who we should want to be. I hope we can work together to \\nfind a way to change that rule as well.\\n  I see my good friend, the Senator from Hawaii, is here. We are \\nworking on some things together right now that we would like to get to \\nthe floor and have those bills voted on later.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=1046, text=\"  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank \\nhim for his leadership and levelheadedness.\\n  As he is on his way out, I will say that I think the current way we \\ndeal with nominees is not tenable. I imagine a scenario where we have a \\nDemocratic President, and it will take even longer than it is currently \\ntaking to confirm nominees. I think there are a number of us on both \\nsides of the aisle who are open to modifying the way we operate.\\n\\n\\n  For me, the blue-slip question is a redline. I think what they are \\ndoing with the blue slips undermines the individual ability for any \\nSenator to have their say, especially as it relates to the circuit \\ncourts, but I think there is an opportunity to have a conversation.\\n  On climate generally, I am looking forward to a debate, but it is \\nvery difficult to debate in the Senate when only one party proffers a \\nproposal. I don't mean this as rhetorical flourish. I don't mean this \\nas a personal accusation or a partisan attack. It is just a fact that \\nthere are no climate proposals coming from the Senators who are \\nRepublican. There are zero. So they are trying to have a debate about a \\nresolution which was nonbinding and which was signed by 12 Senators. I \\nget it, but I think, given that this is the world's greatest \\ndeliberative body, we ought to have a proper debate about climate \\nchange.\\n  We are actually in a climate emergency. This is the most important \\nmoment in the world's history as it relates to this particular crisis. \\nWe are sitting here trying to score points about an FAQ that was posted \\non a new Congresswoman's website and trying to make fun of each other \\nand say: They are going to ban cows and ice cream. It is very silly, \\nand it is not worthy of the seriousness of the moment.\\n  I would ask my Republican colleagues--I see a number of them who take \\nthe debt, foreign policy, cyber security, personal privacy, and the \\nrules of the Senate very seriously. They are very levelheaded human \\nbeings with a seriousness of purpose. Yet when it comes to climate \\nchange, it gets into this goofy thing where they are doing everything \\nexcept debating climate change and what ought to be done about it.\\n  We spent 5, maybe 10 years trying to get most Republicans to concede \\nthat this problem exists at all. Now a lot of them are feeling \\ncomfortable saying: Yes, this problem exists, but all of the solutions \\nproposed by Democrats are wrong.\\n  That is fine, but I ask this question in all sincerity: What do \\nRepublican Senators propose to do about the climate crisis? What is \\nyour plan? If you don't like cap and trade; if you don't like a fee on \\ncarbon; if you don't like massive investment in green technology and \\nclean technology; if you don't like the extension of the investment tax \\ncredit and the production tax credit; if you don't like our solution; \\nif you don't like being part of the Paris climate accord--which, by the \\nway, is nonbinding, which means we get to decide what our pathway is to \\nclean energy. It is not as though the U.N. gets to tell us what to do. \\nIt gives us leverage to make sure that as we move forward toward clean \\nenergy, the other countries don't cheat. It actually gives us leverage \\nin this situation.\\n  If you don't like our solutions, that is fine. This is the world's \\ngreatest deliberative body. This is where the greatest debates in U.S. \\nhistory have happened. Yet, maybe 19 times out of 20, I have come down \\nto the floor to talk about climate change, and there were Members on \\nthis side of the aisle and zero Members on the other side of the aisle. \\nAgain, I don't mean this as an attack; I just want a real debate.\\n  I am looking at the Senator from Georgia. We have had robust \\ndiscussions about debt and deficits and the way we try to avoid \\nshutdowns and sequester and all the rest of it. When it comes to \\nclimate change, everybody gets really goofy. Everybody puts on their \\npartisan uniform and refuses to engage. If this debate about the Green \\nNew Deal offers us an opportunity to talk about the planetary crisis, \\nthen I am happy for it.\\n  We are in debate time on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead the \\nEPA, so it might be helpful to know the origins of the Agency.\\n  In the 1960s, the state of the environment was catastrophic. Millions \\nof freshwater fish and rivers around the country were being poisoned by \\ninsecticides, hurting consumer trust and the countless fishermen and \\nfamilies who made a living that way. Pollution was so bad that debris \\nfloating in the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, causing \\nthousands of dollars in property damage. The water in Lake Superior \\nbecame so toxic from companies' dumping asbestos-laden waste that local \\ncommunities had to start filtering their own water. Think about that. \\nPeople could drink the water from their local reservoirs unfiltered \\nuntil industrial pollution came along.\\n  This was the path our country was on. Pollution was destroying many \\nof the most beautiful places in the country and, maybe more \\nimportantly, putting the health of the public at risk.\\n\\n  A scientist named Rachel Carson came along and changed everything \\nwhen she wrote a book that helped the United States see that we \\ncouldn't go on like this. Her book was a call for change, and millions \\nof Americans, on a bipartisan basis, demanded change.\\n  There was a predictable backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman \\nsaid as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:\\n\\n       The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book ``Silent \\n     Spring'' are gross distortions of the actual facts, \\n     completely unsupported by scientific, experimental evidence, \\n     and general practical experience in the field. Her suggestion \\n     that pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is \\n     obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without \\n     selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely \\n     useless.\\n\\n  This controversy went on for the next few years. The public, the \\nscience, and the reality pointed toward the truth, but a few loud \\nvoices tried to stop the country from making progress. They said that \\nRachel Carson distorted the facts, that the science wasn't there, and \\nthat there was no need to rush judgment.\\n  The U.S. Government moved forward anyway and began to lay the \\nfoundation for a new America--one that would preserve and protect our \\ncountry and its resources for the next generation.\\n  In 1970, President Nixon united several offices and bureaus already \\nin the Federal Government into one single agency, the EPA. The EPA was \\ncharged with protecting the Nation's health and being the steward of \\nthe environment. It has a legacy of fulfilling that mission. The Agency \\nended the use of a dangerous pesticide called DDT. It found a solution \\nto acid rain, which was once a major issue for fish, forests, and \\nfarming. It took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor public \\nplaces.\\n  Thanks to the EPA, Rachel Carson's ``fable for tomorrow'' did not \\nbecome a reality, but here we are decades later facing another \\nenvironmental crisis, one that affects the United States and every \\nother Nation on this planet, and I am worried that we are not going to \\ndo the right thing this time.\\n  Instead of facing head-on and in a bipartisan way the biggest crisis \\nin the planet's history, the party in power is not just ignoring the \\nproblem; they are making it worse. And they are doing it by nominating \\nand confirming people like Andrew Wheeler. This is someone who said: \\n``Manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the \\nAmerican people.'' This is the guy to head the EPA. He says manmade \\nglobal warming is a hoax. This is someone who was formally the vice \\npresident of the Washington Coal Club, who lobbied for coal companies.\\n  We are in a planetary emergency, and Republicans want someone who is \\nadvancing the interests of top polluters to be the Nation's chief \\nenvironmental steward so that he can continue to advance the interest \\nof the top polluters. Again, it is not just that they are ignoring \\nclimate change, which would be bad enough; it is that they are \\naggressively, proudly, gleefully sometimes, making it worse.\\n  Researchers at Harvard found that the EPA's recent plans to gut the \\nClean Power Plan will lead to more greenhouse gas emissions. Their plan \\nwill be worse for climate than if they did nothing at all. Think about \\nthat. If the EPA did nothing at all, it would be better than what they \\nare doing now. This is the result of Mr. Wheeler's leadership, which \\nhas until now been in an Acting Director capacity.\\n  During the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, the EPA was led by Anne \\nGorsuch Burford, who ended up resigning in scandal. President Reagan \\nnominated as her replacement William Ruckelshaus, whom people trusted \\nto do the job and stabilize the EPA. He was a moderate. He was a steady \\nhand. The EPA could use a steady hand after Scott Pruitt, who promoted \\nthe interests of polluters over the health of the American people and \\nwho crossed many ethical lines. Yet Andrew Wheeler is no Ruckelshaus. \\nThat much is clear from his time at the EPA. Under his leadership, EPA \\ninspections are at a 10-year\\n\\n\\nlow. EPA fines are at a 25-year low. Restrictions on new coal plants \\nhave been eliminated. Limits on methane pollution are in the process of \\nbeing rolled back. In other words, polluters are getting their way. \\nThat is great news for people who own oil and gas companies, but it is \\nhorrible news for people with asthma, for farmers who are trying to get \\nthrough the worst drought season seen in a century, and for small \\nbusinesses that are losing customers because of fires.\\n\\n  Listen, climate change is here. It is hurting everything from local \\neconomies, to public health, to national security, and the Republicans \\nhave decided that the best person to lead the Agency to do something \\nabout it is a coal lobbyist. It would be funny if it were not so \\noutrageous.\\n  The Democrats have a plan for climate change. We have ideas to invest \\nin clean air, clean water, and smarter infrastructure. We have bills on \\ninvestment and production tax credits, solar energy, wind energy, \\nconservation and efficiency, carbon pricing, and planting trees, and we \\nhave stood together against nominations like this one. It is time for \\nthe Republicans, if not to stand with us, to at least then stand on the \\nother side against us and engage in this great debate. What are we \\ngoing to do with climate change? We have proposals, and they have none.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1048, text=\"  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a crisis in my home \\nState and indeed five other States across the Southeast. I rise to talk \\nabout disasters in California and to talk about our friends in Puerto \\nRico.\\n  On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida \\nPanhandle as a category 4 hurricane. It was one of the strongest storms \\nto ever hit the United States. Over the next few hours, Hurricane \\nMichael barreled through Florida and tore through southwest Georgia. In \\na matter of minutes, homes were flattened, tracks of timber were \\ndestroyed, and farmers' crops lay down in the field. People's lives \\nwere radically affected forever.\\n  This hurricane hit at exactly the time of year when most crops were \\nready for harvest. It doesn't matter if they were peanuts, cotton, or \\npecans--they were all just beautiful this year. As a matter of fact, in \\nthe State of Georgia, I grew up working on our family's farm there, and \\nI have to say the cotton crop last year was probably the best I had \\never seen. It was almost cruel. Today, agriculture is Georgia's top \\nindustry and our No. 1 economic driver. Before the hurricane, farmers \\nin my State were expecting a record harvest. Instead, their crops were \\ncompletely destroyed.\\n  Shortly after the hurricane hit, President Trump, Vice President \\nPence, and Secretary of Agriculture Perdue all came down to Georgia. \\nTogether, we toured the devastation and heard from farmers and local \\nofficials about the tough road of recovery ahead. Some farmers said \\nthey could clean up, replant, and have a crop next year as long as they \\nhad adequate resources. Other farmers were not so lucky.\\n  Georgia is the top pecan-producing State in the country. One of our \\nlargest pecan farms is owned by two brothers in Bainbridge, which the \\nVice President and I personally visited. We personally saw the damage \\nin their fields. Some 800 acres of pecan trees were gone. I cannot \\ndescribe to you what that looks like. On the ground was a solid \\ncarpet--if you can imagine this--of mature, beautiful, inch-long pecans \\nthat were ready to be harvested but were on the ground, ruined.\\n  One brother said:\\n\\n       The farmer in me wants to farm this land, but there's no \\n     way I can make it. Next year is the year I'll lose it, \\n     because we're not like the cotton guy. Nothing against them, \\n     but they get to replant a seed next year and have a crop. I \\n     don't.\\n\\n  The problem is that the pecan crop can be annually insured, but there \\nis no insurance product for insuring pecan trees. If these two brothers \\nreplant, it could take 7 to 10 years for the trees to mature enough to \\neven generate a minimum revenue. Most likely, full production would \\ntake over 12 years. For them, this is truly a generational loss.\\n  The other brother said:\\n\\n       My brother and I built this business from nothing. We will \\n     make it. We may not be in the pecan business anymore, but \\n     we will be doing something else. We are fighters. [Our \\n     families are committed to this land.] You just have to go \\n     on.\\n\\n  When they saw the devastation, President Trump and Vice President \\nPence stepped up to the plate and made a commitment to our agriculture \\ncommunity.\\n  President Trump said: ``Farmers really got hurt here, especially in \\nGeorgia, but we're going to get it taken care of.''\\n  Vice President Pence said:\\n\\n       We will rebuild these crops and these communities. We will \\n     restore southwest Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt region \\n     bigger and better than ever before.\\n\\n  This afternoon, I am here to say that the Vice President and the \\nPresident are living up to their word. After this disaster relief was \\ncaught up in the political nightmare of funding the last 25 percent of \\nthis year's budget, we now have the opportunity to put this standalone \\nsupplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. The \\nPresident and Vice President have been absolutely resolute in their \\nsupport of getting aid to the victims of these disasters. They are now \\nasking Congress to pass this all-inclusive disaster relief bill right \\nnow.\\n  The State of Georgia has already stepped up and offered tax credits, \\nshort-term financing, and other forms of direct assistance to those who \\nhave been impacted, but they have only scratched the surface. The \\npeople of Georgia have come together and helped their neighbors, served \\nmeals to each other, and assisted first responders in their recovery \\nefforts.\\n  In Florida alone, then-Governor Rick Scott, who is now our colleague \\nhere on the Senate floor, was in the race for this Senate seat, and he \\nactually suspended his campaign to devote all of his time, in his \\nresponsibility as the Governor, to lead the effort of analyzing the \\ndamage in Florida and determining what needed to be done. He can speak \\ndirectly to the need. He is a cosponsor of this bill, I might add.\\n  However, despite efforts by Senator Isakson and others and me in our \\nState, this Senate body has yet to take action on disaster relief for \\nthe agriculture community in the Southeast. Our farmers simply cannot \\nwait any longer. The situation in my State is dire. I would say it is \\nthe same across the South. Because revenue from the 2018 harvest was \\ndestroyed, bankers can't lend money to farmers who right now are asking \\nto borrow money to put seed in the ground, to fertilize the ground, and \\nto prepare the ground for next year's crop. It is as simple as that. \\nGrowers cannot replant because they can't get their financial houses in \\norder because we haven't adopted a resolution for last year's harvest \\nthat they were not able to achieve. Rural communities are suffering, \\nand in many places, economic activity is at an absolute standstill as \\nit waits for the Federal Government--this body and the House of \\nRepresentatives--to do its job.\\n  For some in my State, the timing of assistance is not just a matter \\nof putting a crop in the ground this year; it is a matter of \\npotentially never putting a crop in the ground again. If we do not help \\nthese people right now, they may lose their businesses and livelihoods \\nthrough no fault of their own. That is the reality we are facing here. \\nThe people in my State have asked me to utilize every sphere of \\ninfluence, turn over every stone, and exhaust all options to get \\ndisaster relief right now.\\n  We are past the time when this should have gotten done. I have spoken \\nwith the President many times about this. His commitment to our farmers \\nis unwavering. Just last Monday night, he said: David, get it done. He \\ncalled me again on Saturday night before he left for Vietnam. He said: \\nDavid, what do we have to do to get this bill across the Senate floor? \\nTalk to our friends in the House, and make sure that everything that is \\nneeded is in.\\n  Senator Isakson, I, and several other Senators have introduced a \\nsupplemental disaster relief bill on the floor of the Senate, and \\nPresident Trump has agreed to sign it. Our bill includes disaster \\nrelief for agriculture. It also provides additional funds for Georgia \\nand other States like Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas, Alaska, Hawaii, \\nand California that have battled natural disasters over the last year \\non\\n\\n\\ntheir own. It also builds on the Trump administration's past efforts \\nand includes the remaining funding for Puerto Rico.\\n  Both the House and Senate have previously supported similar \\nproposals. They should be even more inclined to do so now that it is \\nnot tied up with the overall 2019 budget drama. This is a standalone \\nsupplemental bill that includes those things that people on both sides \\nof this body agreed to and voted for just last year. This bipartisan \\npackage is a win for our farmers. It is a win for families and \\nbusinesses that were devastated by historic hurricanes in the Southeast \\nand wildfires in the West. It is a win for the people of Puerto Rico \\nwhom the President has previously helped. He was committed to including \\nthat in this bill.\\n  I sincerely hope this body will move quickly and pass this disaster \\nrelief bill without further delay. I humbly ask each of my colleagues \\nin this body for their individual support and for their vote in this \\ndisaster relief package that will save hundreds, if not thousands, of \\nfarming families in my home State from having to give up what they \\nlove, and that is farming the land that in many cases they inherited \\nfrom their families. In other cases, people who graduated from HBCUs--\\nsome of our brightest young people--borrowed money to buy the land or \\nare leasing the land, and they are in danger of losing this dream of \\nmaking a living on the ground in Georgia.\\n  Our country and our people are counting on us to get this done, and \\ntime is of the essence.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1052, text=\"  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I come to the floor in opposition to \\nAndrew Wheeler's nomination to lead the Environmental Protection \\nAgency.\\n  Americans across this country depend on EPA to protect their public \\nhealth, yet under this administration, EPA has failed again and again \\nto reassure my constituents that their basic rights to breathe in clean \\nair and sip clean water are being prioritized.\\n  Listen, I am proud that EPA's Region 5 office is headquartered in \\nChicago. Region 5 has led the country in enforcing the Clean Air Act, \\nthe Clean Water Act, and other bedrock environmental policies that \\nCongress has passed. But under Mr. Wheeler and this administration, EPA \\nhas made it harder for the scientists, engineers, and public health \\nexperts in Region 5 to do their jobs.\\n  EPA is severely understaffed and underfunded, and in 2018, major \\nenforcement actions dropped to their lowest levels in more than 10 \\nyears. Last year, EPA competed fewer than 11,000 inspections and \\nevaluations of polluters across the country--the lowest number in \\nalmost two decades.\\n  In 2018, EPA sent just 123 civil pollution violation cases to the \\nJustice Department for prosecution. That is about 40 percent less than \\nthe annual average during the Obama administration. So, sadly, it \\nshould come as no surprise that a report from the Environmental \\nIntegrity Project this month found that communities across the country \\nare now being put at risk of exposure to dangerous contaminants.\\n  To make matters worse, the EPA's enforcement workforce has been \\nshrinking for years, and the Trump administration wants to cut it back \\neven further.\\n  These cutbacks are leaving communities, especially low-income \\ncommunities and those of color, exposed to public health risks. \\nMeanwhile, polluters are being let off the hook for serious violations \\nof the law.\\n  I have seen firsthand what happens when EPA fails to enforce our laws \\nand protect public health. It causes fear and confusion. For months, \\nresidents in Willowbrook, IL, have lived in fear that the air they \\nbreathe in has been making their family sick.\\n  Here is a little background. A facility in their community has been \\nreleasing cancer-causing emissions for decades. Unfortunately, even \\nsince EPA discovered just how toxic this chemical was years ago--years \\nago--they have refused to issue new regulations updating safety \\nstandards based on the latest science.\\n  Making matters even worse, EPA officials refused to notify local \\npublic health or elected officials about their discovery, leaving \\ncommunities in the dark even while their health is at risk, leaving \\nmore families more likely to get sick, leaving more children more \\nlikely to die.\\n  As a mother, this is heartbreaking. As a Senator, this is outrageous.\\n  When Willowbrook residents first started to raise concerns, EPA \\nwasn't the least bit transparent. The Agency had to be pushed by \\nSenator Durbin, other Members of the Illinois congressional delegation, \\nand me just to hold community forums.\\n  My office also received alarming information alleging that senior \\npolitical appointees instructed EPA personnel not to inspect any \\nfacility in Region 5 that emits the same carcinogen found at this \\nfacility. If true, this type of political interference is beyond \\nunacceptable. If true, it is happening on Mr. Wheeler's watch.\\n  I have asked EPA to take several steps to fix this crisis, and I am \\nstill waiting for their response.\\n  In the absence of leadership from EPA, Senator Durbin and I have \\nauthored two pieces of legislation to ensure that this kind of crisis \\nnever happens again.\\n  Here is what Gabriela, a resident of Willowbrook, said when she saw \\nthe list of health problems associated with this facility: ``It was \\nlike reading our medical history.''\\n  Since she moved to her home in 2009, Gabriela has suffered from \\nintense headaches, dizziness, nausea, inability to concentrate, and \\nmemory loss. She has found it difficult to read through briefs and \\nalmost instantly forgets movie plots and even some conversations.\\n  Both of her children, who have lived in the house for most of their \\nlives, have had respiratory problems since they were little. Her 12-\\nyear-old daughter has often coughed to the point of vomiting and has \\ndeveloped a bone cyst.\\n  One of her 9-year-old daughter's classmates was recently diagnosed \\nwith leukemia, as was Gabriella's next-door neighbor, an otherwise \\nhealthy man in his early fifties.\\n  Another woman I have gotten to know from Willowbrook is named \\nNeringa. She told me that when she and her husband were moving to \\nChicago 5 years ago, they picked their home because it seemed like a \\nplace where their children would be safe.\\n  She went on:\\n\\n       You look for sexual predators, good schools, taxes. You \\n     don't think you would have to look at air and water. You feel \\n     like it is the one thing in our country we wouldn't have to \\n     think about.\\n\\n  Exposure from toxic pollution is a matter of life and death for these \\nresidents. It was uncovered only when career civil servants did their \\njob and flagged a risk they observed in a routine model that EPA \\npublishes.\\n  I am extremely concerned that other areas in Illinois could face \\nsimilar issues and that other kids in other communities could be \\nbreathing in air full of cancer-causing chemicals when they are playing \\non the swings at recess or walking home from school later that \\nafternoon.\\n  I need EPA to respond to the requests I have made on behalf of Lake \\nCounty and actually conduct the kind of monitoring that exposed the \\nproblem in Willowbrook there and in every community that may be at \\nrisk.\\n  Not far from Willowbrook, residents in Chicago have also been facing \\nseveral public health threats for decades.\\n  Chicago, IL, is the birthplace of Hazel Johnson, the ``Mother of the \\nEnvironmental Justice Movement,'' a pioneer of environmental justice \\nactivism on the South Side of Chicago.\\n  She founded People for Community Recovery in 1979 in an effort to get \\nasbestos out of the buildings in her community. Soon she managed to \\ntrace air and water pollution in her community to nearby industry, \\nwhich was using the predominantly lower income African-American \\ncommunity as a dumping ground.\\n  Hazel Johnson knew what I know: Every American has a right to breathe \\nin safe air, drink clean water, and live\\n\\n\\non uncontaminated land, no matter where they live, no matter the color \\nof their skin, no matter their tax bracket.\\n  Yet I still hear about manganese pollution, petcoke, particulate \\nmatter, and lead exposure from these residents on a daily basis.\\n  Chicago residents deserve--no, they need--environmental justice. But \\nfor some reason, this administration has dismantled the office that is \\nsupposed to lead this work, even trying to eliminate EPA's \\nenvironmental justice funding and drive out the office's top talent.\\n  Lead exposure is an issue that impacts low-income families and \\ncommunities of color disproportionately. I had high hopes that I would \\nbe able to work with Mr. Wheeler on the administration's response to \\nthis crisis. Yet after months and months of delays, I am very \\ndisappointed by their so-called plan.\\n  Mr. Wheeler's lead action plan falls short of what was promised and \\nthe ``war on lead'' his predecessor declared. This is not a plan with \\ngoals, strategies, and deadlines. Instead, it is a repackaged version \\nof a report published under the Obama administration. Little has \\nchanged, other than the window dressing.\\n  What disappointed me most was that the administration appears to be \\nwalking back our goal of eliminating lead exposure, settling simply for \\nreducing it. That is unacceptable.\\n  Even to this day, in a post-Flint crisis world, too many in power are \\nsitting idly by as countless Americans are exposed to lead. More than 6 \\nmillion homes get water from lead service lines, and 24 million homes \\nhave lead hazards in paint, dust, or soil. Nearly half a million \\nchildren have elevated levels of lead in their blood.\\n  Let's be clear. For children, there is no safe level of lead \\nallowable in drinking water. Even low levels can cause permanent brain \\ndamage in kids, lowering IQ, and inflicting other cognitive damage. \\nImagine if your child were one of those who had gotten sick because the \\nEPA refused to take action on such an obvious crisis. Imagine how \\ninfuriating, how devastating that would be.\\n  We must make meaningful progress in tackling sources of exposure, and \\nEPA must take up an aggressive, comprehensive, and practical strategy.\\n  I know we can make real progress in reducing lead in our society, but \\nthe new lead action plan is a missed opportunity to advance those \\nefforts.\\n  I also believe that Mr. Wheeler has far too many conflicts of \\ninterest to be running the EPA. As a former lobbyist for Murray Energy, \\nMr. Wheeler has worked closely with the industries he would regulate as \\nthe leader of the EPA. It is well reported that Mr. Wheeler's former \\nfirm lobbied the EPA on efforts Wheeler now oversees.\\n  Even after he took temporary reins of the EPA, he made no secret of \\nmeeting with former clients and fossil fuel industry representatives. \\nCNN and Reuters have both reported that Wheeler is heavily prioritizing \\nmeetings with industry over anyone else and has attended more than 50 \\nmeetings with companies or industry groups that EPA regulates.\\n  If this news doesn't alarm you, it may be because corruption is \\nbecoming routine under this administration. After all, just earlier \\nthis week, the Washington Post reported that the Assistant \\nAdministrator for Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, has been routinely \\nmeeting with former clients in the fossil fuel industry from his not-\\nso-long-ago lobbying days.\\n  I placed a hold on Mr. Wehrum's nomination because I did not think he \\ncould be trusted with our Nation's air. I feel the same way about Mr. \\nWheeler's leading the EPA.\\n  According to the Sierra Club, every third day during his first 100 \\ndays as Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler either, one, rolled back a \\nnew climate policy; two, ignored or contradicted science; three, met \\nwith big polluters; four, limited the EPA's ability to protect us from \\npollution; or, five, gave in to corporate polluter demands--all of that \\nin just his first 3 months and change. Imagine what would happen if we \\ngave him the reins for good.\\n  Mr. Wheeler's position on climate change policy alone is \\ndisqualifying. Consider, for example, his attack on the Clean Power \\nPlan. Climate change is a major threat to our environment, our economy, \\nand our national security--something that even Donald Trump's own \\nintelligence officials admit.\\n  My home State of Illinois is already experiencing the consequences of \\ninaction. Growing seasons are changing, heat waves are increasing, and \\nextreme floods are becoming more frequent and more severe. Just this \\nDecember we had a hurricane. Mitigating these effects will require \\nsensible policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in \\nclean energy.\\n  Under the Clean Water Act, EPA is legally required to limit carbon \\npollution from powerplants, pollution that we know is the primary \\ndriver of climate change.\\n  That is why the Obama administration established a Clean Power Plan--\\nto provide States the flexibility they need to meet a national goal of \\n32 percent reductions in carbon pollution by 2030. This plan was the \\nculmination of robust and rigorous public participation, and EPA \\nreceived millions of comments supporting the program from States, \\nthrough its utilities, communities of color, Tribes, environmental \\ngroups, labor unions, and the public at large.\\n  The Clean Power Plan was not only good for the environment; it was \\ngood for the economy, too. In Illinois, residents are expected to save \\nan average of up to 4 percent on electricity bills by 2030. Illinois \\nenergy efficiency investments alone are estimated to grow our economy \\nby $2 billion in that same year, and we lead the Midwest in clean \\nenergy jobs.\\n  But no matter the obvious global, national, and economic benefits, \\nMr. Wheeler has led the administration's efforts to roll back the Clean \\nPower Plan. His replacement proposal would adversely impact public \\nhealth and lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths from increased \\nsoot, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, and 100,000 \\nmissed school and work days annually by 2030.\\n  Internationally, this proposal would leave the United States further \\nbehind our allies that have taken aggressive action on climate change. \\nThe proposal also fails low-income communities and communities of \\ncolor, which bear the brunt of our environmental and public health \\nburdens. Unlike the Clean Power Plan, this platform doesn't even \\nrequire States to engage environmental justice and community groups in \\ntheir plan development processes. It also fails to encourage States to \\nconduct environmental justice analysis of their own as they develop \\nimplementation plans.\\n  EPA should be working to strengthen policies like the Clean Power \\nPlan. It is more than troubling that Mr. Wheeler and the Trump \\nadministration are instead seeking to repeal them entirely. Now is not \\nthe time to move backward.\\n  Here is what Evan, who grew up in Libertyville, IL, shared with me:\\n\\n       I write because I am concerned about the future. The future \\n     of the world, the future for the United States and my own \\n     future. At this time, I feel that perhaps the greatest threat \\n     to that future is climate change. The current \\n     Administration's stance towards the issue has discouraged me \\n     to no end, and I can't help but despair as the President \\n     makes light of this existential threat to the wellbeing of \\n     the planet.\\n       I know, of course, that not all lawmakers share the \\n     President's stance towards this issue. Please, make some \\n     noise.\\n\\n  Evan, I hear you. I hear your fear, and I want you to know that I \\nbelieve the Nation should be focused on building a clean energy economy \\nand a climate-safe future for your generation. I hear you, and I am \\ngoing to make that noise for you.\\n  I am also angry at EPA's abuse of the small refinery waiver program \\nunder the renewable fuel standard. The RFS includes a policy to help \\nsmall refineries that cannot afford to comply with the RFS. Before \\nDonald Trump took power, this policy was rarely used. Under the Trump \\nadministration, however, nearly every exemption application has been \\nsecretly granted. This includes applications from large, multibillion \\ndollar companies like Exxon and Chevron that are earning record \\nprofits. These companies' CEOs have even pointed to hardship waivers on \\nearnings clauses as contributing to their profitability.\\n  The administration's stance reduces incentives for blending--slashing \\ndemands for biofuels and feedstocks--actively hurting farmers and \\nbiofuels\\n\\n\\ncompanies. These waivers could hurt the markets for years to come, \\nholding back homegrown biofuels while creating windfall profits for \\nlarge oil refiners--the exact opposite of this administration's promise \\nto voters.\\n  Let's be blunt. EPA is taking money out of farmers' hands and giving \\nit to billionaire oil companies. These actions come at a time when \\nbiofuel producers and farmers across our country are already hurting. \\nFarm income is at its lowest since 2006, and retaliatory trade measures \\nfrom China threaten to deepen the crisis.\\n  Yet early reports indicate that the small refinery waivers EPA has \\ngranted under President Trump and Mr. Wheeler will reduce demand for \\nbiofuels by billions. Over the past 6 months, we have seen more ethanol \\nplants sold, idled, or closed than ever before. When I asked Mr. \\nWheeler during the confirmation hearing about EPA's apparent change in \\npolicy to now seemingly granting every exemption application, he made \\nexcuses justifying them. We need a leader at the EPA who is going to \\nstand up for our farmers, not capitulate to the demands of Big Oil.\\n  We also need a leader at the EPA who is going to protect the Great \\nLakes. The 1,000 employees in Region 5 work tirelessly to protect the \\nenvironment, health, and safety of Americans living in Illinois, \\nIndiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. They live, work, and \\nraise their families in the communities they protect, and they are \\nleaders in the fields of water quality, Superfund cleanup, and Great \\nLakes restoration.\\n  Region 5 is also home to the Great Lakes Program Office, which \\nensures that we keep the promises we made to Canada under the Great \\nLakes Water Quality Agreement. It also leads the Nation's Great Lakes \\nRestoration Initiative, which has funded more than 2,000 projects that \\nimprove water quality, protect wildlife, and clean up toxic pollutants \\nthat threaten our water supply.\\n  To date, the program has invested more than $2.2 billion in Great \\nLakes restoration projects. Coordinated in both the United States and \\nCanada, GLRI sets the standards for interagency and international \\ncooperation. Every $1 invested in Great Lakes restoration results in a \\n$2 return in the form of increased fishing, tourism, and home values. \\nBut in addition to enduring a shutdown, the employees in Region 5 who \\nlead these programs have been bought out, undermined, and reorganized \\ninto positions they are not suited for, and that is unacceptable.\\n  What is also unacceptable is Mr. Wheeler's attacks on science and \\nscience integrity. Science does not have a political affiliation. \\nScience is about learning, and it never stands still. It gives us the \\nbuilding blocks to help us increase our knowledge over time and to find \\never-better solutions to the challenges we face. Unfortunately, this \\nEPA has led the administration's attacks on science when it doesn't fit \\nwith their pro-polluter agenda.\\n  What is at stake is not just our health and future but also America's \\nstanding and influence in the world. Just this month, EPA released the \\nnames of eight new members of its science advisory board. I am \\nconcerned that several of the new members represent interests who seek \\nto undermine the independence and quality of the scientific advice \\ngiven to the EPA. University researchers are now in the minority on the \\nboard, while the number of industry-affiliated members and members \\nlisted as consultants has increased.\\n\\n  Here is how the Union of Concerned Scientists summarized the new \\nappointments made by Wheeler to the Science Advisory Board. Take Dr. \\nJohn Christy. He has a reputation for controversial climate research \\nand denying the evidence of global warming.\\n  Then, there is Dr. Brant Ulsh, a consultant who argues that radiation \\nat low doses isn't a big deal, contrary to the conclusions of the \\nNational Academy of Science.\\n  New member Dr. Richard Williams has received compensation from the \\nAmerican Chemistry Council's formaldehyde panel, which was set up to \\nobfuscate the health impacts of this carcinogen. He is also on the \\nboard of trustees of the International Life Sciences Institute, an \\nindustry-funded organization that is notorious for pushing out shoddy \\nnutrition science.\\n  Dr. Barbara Beck is a consultant with Gradient, which has itself \\nearned a reputation for helping industry defend their products with \\nfavorable scientific studies. Beck herself helped to write a paper \\narguing that exposure to lead at low doses is not necessarily harmful \\nto children, which is in stark contrast to the CDC's assessment that \\nthere is no safe level of exposure to lead.\\n  The common thread among these individuals is that they are \\npractitioners of the widely used disinformation playbook. They \\nfrequently work to inject uncertainty into science by criticizing risk \\nassessments and underlying models. They argue that exposure to \\npollutants at low doses is not worth worrying about. That is not true. \\nPollution is pollution, and it is bad for communities, and it is bad \\nfor public health.\\n  I also want to spend some time discussing the administration's new \\nclean water rule. For more than 45 years, the Clean Water Act has \\npreserved, protected, and restored our Nation's most important natural \\nresource and radically transformed how our Nation uses water. That is \\nwhy admirers of CWA appropriately labeled this law as one of the most \\nsuccessful public health initiatives ever enacted. Continued success of \\nthe CWA requires developing a clear, concise rule for determining which \\nbodies of water are protected by the Clean Water Act. However, Mr. \\nWheeler and the Trump administration have proposed a rule that fails to \\nprovide the clear-cut certainty requested by my constituents. It would \\ncancel protections for drinking water sources of tens of millions of \\npeople. It would also cancel protections for streams and wetlands that \\nprovide habitat for wildlife and protect communities from flooding.\\n  Communities across the country, particularly low-income communities \\nand communities of color, already struggle to access clean water. Mr. \\nWheeler's proposed rule will make it even harder for these communities. \\nMr. Wheeler's water rule puts the profits of corporate polluters before \\nour health and clean water for our families.\\n  Alan, from Wheeling, IL, wrote to me and said:\\n\\n       This is insanity. There is nothing more important than \\n     protecting the sources of water that many people in this \\n     country drink from.\\n       No source of drinking water should be open for pollution or \\n     destruction, but that is exactly what this proposal does by \\n     stripping protections from critical streams and wetlands \\n     across the country.\\n       Senator Duckworth, please do anything that is possible to \\n     protect our environment and industries that depend upon clean \\n     water.\\n\\n  Alan, thank you for writing to me. I agree with you. This rule makes \\nno scientific, legal, public health, or fiscal sense.\\n  Another constituent, Dave from Rockford, shared with me similar \\nconcerns. He wrote:\\n\\n       Clean water is not a political issue. Protecting our \\n     watersheds and ensuring that clean, fresh water is available \\n     for fish, farms and communities is not an option--it's a \\n     responsibility.\\n       I cannot think of a more enjoyable satisfaction [than] just \\n     standing in a clean river, seeing all the life teaming in it, \\n     and knowing that our hard work is paying off.\\n\\n  Dave is right. Streams and wetlands work as natural filters and \\nsponges, keeping our drinking water supplies safe, while reducing the \\nimpact of floods.\\n  Like our water, I am concerned by this administration's attacks on \\nclean air. One group that comes to mind that has been fighting for our \\nclean air is Mom's Clean Air Task Force. They are a group of moms who \\nknow how painful it is when their child can't play outside because they \\nhave asthma or there is smog outside. They are fighting for cleaner air \\nand stronger kids.\\n  They list ten reasons they oppose Mr. Wheeler, and among those \\nreasons are his attacks on rules to control mercury pollution, to make \\nour cars more fuel efficient, and to reduce smog.\\n  Mr. Wheeler's attacks on these priorities hits close to home for me. \\nCurrently, the rate of asthma in Illinois is 13 percent higher than the \\nnational average. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranks \\nChicago in the top 10 percent of the most challenging places to live \\nwith asthma. Asthma is hitting the frontline neighborhoods in Chicago \\nharder than in many other\\n\\n\\nplaces in the Nation, with asthma rates in some neighborhoods soaring \\nas high as 33 percent. As the climate gets hotter, air pollution, \\nallergies, and temperatures will trigger more asthma attacks in \\nchildren.\\n  I want to end on a high note. I commend Mr. Wheeler for following \\nthrough on his promise to make himself accessible and to conduct \\nproactive outreach. Compared to Mr. Pruitt, he is an upgrade in terms \\nof professionalism, but that is an incredibly low bar.\\n  At the end of the day, my constituents are depending on me to protect \\nthem from pollution, even if it upsets some in industry. I believe we \\nneed an Administrator who is ready to fight for our kids, to fight for \\nthe Great Lakes, to fight for the civil servants that work at EPA, and \\nto fight for every American's right to clean air, clean water, and a \\nhealthy environment. I believe EPA will achieve its mission when it \\nrequires rigorous enforcement when human health is at stake.\\n  Mr. Wheeler believes that public health must be balanced against the \\nhealth of corporations and industry interests who always want less \\nrules, less oversight, and certainly less enforcement. That is why I \\nmust vote no.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1056, text=\"  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this week the Senate is debating the \\nnomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of the U.S. \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\\n  I am going to make this short because this is bad news for anybody \\nwho wants the Environmental Protection Agency to live up to its \\nfundamental mission; that is, to protect the public health so our \\ncitizens, from sea to shining sea, can breathe clean air and drink \\nclean water.\\n  In my view, Andrew Wheeler is Scott Pruitt without an appetite for \\nluxury travel on the taxpayers' dime--yet another Trump appointee doing \\nthe bidding of the dirtiest, most powerful industry in America, no \\nmatter what physical harm it might do to the people of our country.\\n  To me, the fundamental obligation of an EPA Administrator should be \\nto make sure we don't compromise our health and the environment. \\nRegrettably, Mr. Wheeler has spent his career doing essentially the \\nopposite.\\n  Given what he has done during his time as acting head of the Agency, \\nhe has already proven what sort of backward-thinking Administrator he \\nwill be. In fact, I think it would be fair to say Andrew Wheeler is \\nsure to be ``Administrator Rollback.''\\n  During his time as Acting-Administrator, he's rolled back fuel \\neconomy standards that reduce pollution and help drivers save money at \\nthe pump. Not even the car companies support him on that. He is rolling \\nback the rules designed to stop dirty powerplants from belching toxic \\ngases into the air. He is rolling back rules designed to protect \\nworkers from exposure on the job to dangerous chemicals that can cause \\nheart attacks, for example. He is rolling back EPA enforcement--basic \\nenforcement--of a host of safeguards that are already on the books.\\n  Civil penalties against polluters are now at their lowest since 1994. \\nInspections of potentially toxic industrial sites amount to half of \\nwhat they were just in 2010. Civil fines have plummeted on his watch. \\nJudicial enforcement cases that have begun and are concluded have been \\ncut in half. The Wheeler EPA is already letting environmental criminals \\noff the hook. It is my view that these criminals are not creating \\nvictimless crimes--what they are doing is poisoning our communities, \\nour workplaces, our air, and our water.\\n  Perhaps what is most alarming about his appointment is that he \\nessentially waves a hand of dismissal to the existential threat of \\nclimate change.\\n  I have a lot of open-to-everybody townhall meetings in my State. We \\nhave now had more than 920. Just last week, I held five in different \\nparts of our State. In counties where Donald Trump won and in counties \\nwhere Hillary Clinton won, the issue of climate change comes up \\neverywhere.\\n  At the root of the questions I get in communities that span the \\nphilosophical spectrum is that people are terrified--terrified--of what \\nclimate change is going to bring. They see the news coming out of \\nWashington. They see that the Trump administration isn't just waving \\nthe white flag of surrender on climate change. In effect, it almost \\nfeels as if the Trump people want to bring on those climate changes \\neven faster. Anybody who is walking around in our communities and sees \\ntemperature shifts of more than 30 or 40 degrees on a dime is \\ncompletely aware of what I am talking about, even if the Trump \\nadministration is not.\\n  In my home State, when you talk about climate change, the first thing \\nOregonians think about are wildfires. These fires are not your \\ngrandfather's fires. They are bigger. They are hotter. They are more \\npowerful.\\n  Not too long ago, we actually had a fire leap the Columbia River--our \\nmagnificent Columbia River. This is noteworthy for a variety reasons \\nbut especially because our rivers historically have acted as fire \\nbricks. Now we have these bigger and more powerful fires almost all \\nyear round, not just a few months in the summer, the way it used to be. \\nThese new megafires are extraordinary.\\n  It is almost as if we are trying to get acclimated to the idea of \\nclean air refugees--people who live near areas where fires break out, \\nwith ash built up on their cars like snow in the wintertime.\\n  California has seen its own huge infernos causing horrible fatalities \\nin the last few years. Nevada has seen it, Colorado and Washington as \\nwell. People are literally homeless, out and about in their \\ncommunities, trying to just find a safe place for shelter.\\n  Climate change is also not just about fires. Across the West, there \\nis the threat of crippling drought. The hurricanes that battled the \\nEast Coast and the Gulf of Mexico are intensifying and drowning our \\ncities with rain. It seems like every day there is another report about \\nhow sea levels are rising faster than previously estimated.\\n  Climate change is affecting wildlife in catastrophic ways. Entire \\necosystems could be lost. This week, there were reports that an ice \\nsheet larger than the island of Manhattan broke off from Antarctica. So \\nthe effects of climate change aren't some threat way off in the future. \\nIt is already a massive problem today. Americans feel it, and they see \\nit in their communities again and again.\\n  My wife and I are older parents. We have 11-year-old twins and a 6-\\nyear-old daughter. I--and I am sure there are plenty of other \\nSenators--think about what their generation is going to be dealing with \\ndown the road. This is why there is so much grassroots energy out there \\nabout the Green New Deal, which I am proud to cosponsor.\\n  I can tell you from the conversations I had in Oregon, people know \\nwhat a grave threat climate change poses. They want action. My hope is \\nthat there are a variety of ways, like we saw with the original New \\nDeal, in which we can find some common ground.\\n  I am the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which \\nwrites the tax laws. We have more than 40 separate tax breaks for \\nenergy that are on the books today, and most of them are dirty energy \\ntax relics of yesteryear.\\n  What I have proposed is that we basically throw those 40 energy tax \\nbreaks--relics of dirty energy--in the trash can and substitute three; \\none for clean energy, one for clean transportation fuel, and one for \\nenergy efficiency.\\n  The Presiding Officer is new here. She is getting out and talking to \\nSenators about a variety issues. I can tell her that what I will be \\nsaying to colleagues on the other side of the aisle is something like, \\nmy idea responds to what Republicans have been talking about, the need \\nfor fewer subsidies. We ought to have fewer subsidies for energy.\\n  Why don't we try to work together, find common ground, and do it \\nparticularly on an issue that helps us to promote clean energy at a \\ntime of dramatic climate change?\\n\\n\\n  That is why I believe Andrew Wheeler is the wrong person to lead the \\nEPA. Just when we need Democrats and Republicans to come together to \\nfind fresh ideas to combat climate change, he basically says that it \\nreally isn't a threat at all.\\n  It really isn't a threat to Mr. Wheeler, and he is making the climate \\nchange challenge worse by basically suppressing the authority and the \\nability of the Agency to take this existential challenge head-on.\\n  The mission of the EPA is all about protecting human health, fighting \\nfor clean air, fighting for clean water, and fighting on behalf of \\nAmericans from sea to shining sea.\\n  Andrew Wheeler fights for those who endanger our health and pollute \\nour air and water. This isn't a tough call. I am a no on a nomination \\nthat represents danger and going backward. I urge my colleagues to stay \\nwith me.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1079, text=\"  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \\nconsume.\\n  Today I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8, the so-called Bipartisan \\nBackground Checks Act of 2019. This is bad legislation that fails to \\nmake anyone safer in any regard.\\n  I have been listening here, sitting on the floor for just the last \\nfew minutes and listening to those who came up and were happy about \\nthis bill coming forward today, and they mentioned many acts of mass \\nviolence and situations that have happened. The sad part about it is \\nthey claim this is the answer and the first step. In actuality, it is, \\nat best, a side step, and it may actually be a step backwards and will \\nnot do what it is being claimed to do.\\n  All this legislation will do is burden law-abiding citizens wishing \\nto exercise their Second Amendment rights, including defending \\nthemselves from the gun-toting criminals this bill does nothing to \\ncombat.\\n\\n\\n  H.R. 8 foolishly presumes criminals who flout existing laws will \\nsuddenly submit themselves to background checks.\\n  Are Members who support this bill delusional enough to think a \\ncriminal trading cocaine to another criminal for a firearm will give \\nconsideration to H.R. 8 and go to the nearest gun store to submit to a \\nbackground check? That is absurd.\\n  Most of us will agree that criminals are not going to do that anyway. \\nMy concern is what it actually does in practice to those who are not \\ncriminals.\\n  Not only is it foolish to think they will start following the law, it \\nis also foolish to think it is going to in any way make our country \\nsafer.\\n  My Democratic friends have exploited every mass shooting, calling for \\nuniversal background checks, but H.R. 8 would not have stopped a single \\nmass shooting.\\n  These strategies do, however, share one thing in common. Over and \\nover, we see issues of mental health and missed opportunities for \\nauthorities to intercede.\\n  Let me just say, Mr. Chair, I share the concern. I am going to share, \\nin just a moment, actual, real things that actually could make a \\ndifference in helping to stem the tide of mass violence in our country. \\nBut doing this, we have to understand that this bill does not do that, \\nand what may make you feel good may not heal you. That has to be \\nunderstood.\\n  Look at the recent workplace shooting in Illinois, where the gunman \\nmurdered five people. That could have been prevented, but not by H.R. \\n8. All law enforcement had to do was enforce existing law. The gunman \\nwas prohibited from possessing firearms.\\n  In January 2014, he was issued an Illinois firearm owner's \\nidentification card. That March, he applied to buy a handgun from a gun \\ndealer. Five days later, he took possession of the gun, having \\ninexplicably passed a background check. That month, he applied for a \\nconcealed carry permit. During a background check for the permit, his \\nfelony conviction was flagged.\\n  Illinois police revoked his firearm card and sent him a letter \\ntelling him to relinquish the firearm. Not surprisingly, the felon did \\nnot comply. Had authorities seized the firearm between March 2014 and \\nFebruary 2019, they could have saved five lives.\\n  Aurora, Illinois, is not the only missed opportunity to prevent \\ntragedy. We know about missed opportunities in Parkland; Aurora, \\nColorado; Sutherland Springs; Virginia Tech; and others.\\n  The common problem here, Mr. Chair, is clear. It is not a lack of \\nbackground checks.\\n  With H.R. 8, Democrats refuse to acknowledge the human factors \\nleading to these events, but Republicans have a bill to help law \\nenforcement coordinate responses to mental health concerns and other \\nmass violent threat information.\\n\\n\\n  You know what else H.R. 8 doesn't address? The primary ways criminals \\nacquire firearms. Last month, DOJ revealed nearly half of criminals \\nobtained firearms via theft or the black market. The survey also \\nrevealed that a mere 0.8 percent of criminals purchased their firearms \\nat gun shows.\\n  If this bill won't prevent mass shootings and address violent crime, \\nwhat will it do? It will keep law-abiding citizens from protecting \\nthemselves. Under this bill, Mr. Chair, a battered woman with a \\nprotection order against her abuser who borrows a firearm for self-\\ndefense would be a criminal. It would criminalize the selling of a \\nfirearm without a background check to someone with a valid permit \\nallowing them to possess, acquire, or carry a firearm. If that person \\nwalked into a gun store, they could present that permit and not undergo \\na NICS check.\\n  On the other hand, there are solutions to prevent mass violence and \\ngun crime. The Mass Violence Prevention Act, which I introduced earlier \\nthis week, is one. The MVP Act directly addresses challenges in law \\nenforcement coordination and response. It would reduce the flow of \\nfirearms into the black market, and it would bolster law enforcement's \\nability to prosecute criminals for firearm offenses.\\n  If reducing gun violence, Mr. Chair, is the Democrats' concern, the \\nMVP Act is legislation that we should be considering today, not H.R. 8. \\nTalk to me or my staff about cosponsoring this evidence-based, \\ncommonsense legislation. Unlike H.R. 8, the MVP Act could have \\nprevented tragedies such as Parkland.\\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, my Democratic colleagues, by putting this \\nforward and continuing the same narrative, are not actually interested \\nin stopping gun violence. I take the intent to be good; I do not \\nquestion the motive. All of us in our life do not want to see the \\ntragedies unfold. But this is not the way forward.\\n  This is another thing put out to the very ones who have suffered, \\ntelling them we are helping them, while at the same time not telling \\nthem the truth about the bill, a bill that guts its own ability to \\nenforce itself, a bill that actually, possibly, would keep people from \\npurchasing firearms because of an unlimited price of a background \\ncheck.\\n  The question that I have about this bill, Mr. Chair, is not what \\nactually could happen with this. It is what actually will be hurt by \\nthis as we move forward.\\n  With that, I believe that we are being misled. The victims of mass \\nviolence are being misled by this bill, H.R. 8, because it would not \\nstop what they have been promised that it would stop.\\n  Mr. Chair, for that, I am profoundly sorry. But because of that, I \\ncall on my colleagues to reject H.R. 8 and to support real solutions.\\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\\n  Mr. Chairman, I tell you that H.R. 8 will do little more than further \\nburden law-abiding gun owners. Without an unconstitutional Federal gun \\nregistry, this bill is impossible to enforce.\\n  There is no gun show loophole. Federal law is the same regardless of \\nwhere a firearm sale takes place. Federal law requires all firearms \\ndealers to be licensed and to initiate a background check before \\ntransferring a firearm to a nondealer, regardless of where that \\ntransfer takes place.\\n  As for nondealers, Federal law prohibits transferring a firearm to \\nanyone known or believed to be prohibited from possessing firearms. \\nThat is already the law.\\n  According to DOJ, less than 1 percent of criminals in State prison \\nfor firearm crimes get their firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun \\nshows. According to ATF, 6 percent of Federal armed career criminals \\ngot their firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun shows.\\n  Online sales loophole: There is no online sales loophole. The Federal \\nlaw is the same regardless of how people communicate about selling or \\nbuying a firearm.\\n  Federal law prohibits anyone, licensed firearm dealer or not, from \\nshipping a firearm to a person who lives in another State unless the \\nreceiver is also a dealer. Dealers must document all firearms they \\nreceive.\\n  H.R. 8 also fails to include many of the realistic exceptions to the \\nnew background check requirements for private transfers, such as \\ntransfers between law enforcement officers outside of their duties, \\ntransfers to concealed carry permit holders, transfers to museums or \\nlicensed collectors, transfers to Active Duty military, and many more.\\n  H.R. 8 includes an exception to the background check transfer if the \\ntransfer is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. \\nBut that transfer is only allowed for the length of time that it is \\nnecessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. It doesn't \\neven define those terms.\\n  What about a false alarm? Does it extend to domestic violence fears \\nif the person is not getting attacked immediately? Gun rights groups \\nhave argued that without a definition, this provision would only \\nprovide protection in instances where it is likely too late for the \\nvictim to make it out safely.\\n  Finally, H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the recent high-\\nprofile shootings.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \\nyielding to me.\\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 8, a bill that criminalizes gun \\ntransfers between law-abiding citizens who have no criminal record and \\nno criminal intent.\\n  The bill includes several flawed and unworkable exceptions. Take the \\nlaw enforcement exception. It allows the police to transfer a firearm, \\nbut criminalizes transfers to law enforcement.\\n  Under this bill, a parent whose child finds a gun in a park commits a \\nFederal crime if the parent surrenders the gun to police.\\n  Under this bill, a citizen commits a Federal crime if they \\nparticipate in a local gun buy-back program.\\n  Under this bill, an attorney commits a Federal crime when they turn a \\nclient's gun over to the police to clear the client through ballistics \\ntesting.\\n  Will criminalizing cooperation with law enforcement make us safer? \\nThe majority apparently thinks so, and I think it is crazy.\\n  The Democrats' bill gives special privileges to the bodyguards of the \\nwealthy elite, like former Mayor Bloomberg, who is funding the special \\ninterest advocacy for this bill. He can afford to hire bodyguards. But \\naverage Americans, who rely on the Second Amendment as their source of \\npersonal protection, are not given similar protections.\\n  Nothing should be more offensive to this body than a bill that denies \\ncitizens their endowed rights while giving wealthy elites special \\nprotections, privileges, and dispensations. But that is H.R. 8.\\n  Take the family exception; the rule allows a vote on an amendment to \\nensure that transfers between parent and child include stepparents and \\nstepchildren. What about transfers between a foster parent and foster \\nchild? This bill says foster relationships are not worthy of the same \\nrespect and equal treatment. Every Member of this body should be \\nashamed to vote for this bill that reflects such terrible policy and \\ndiscrimination.\\n  Take the Good Samaritan exception, allowing transfers where a threat \\nof death or harm is imminent. Imminent means death is menacingly near, \\na standard so strict that it is, frankly, too late to transfer a gun \\nonce it is obvious a gun is needed for protection.\\n  Under this standard, it is illegal to loan a gun to a victim of \\ndomestic violence for her protection until the transferor is \\npractically witnessing a murder in progress.\\n  This standard would also prevent a gun owner who has intermittent \\nsuicidal thoughts, a known side-effect of certain prescription \\nmedications, from legally transferring a gun--his own gun--to a friend \\nfor safekeeping.\\n  Because this bill criminalizes transfers between law-abiding \\nAmericans, while doing nothing to curb criminals' access to guns, this \\nbill provides the American public with a false sense of security.\\n  Because this bill includes unworkable exceptions that will mislead \\npeople\\n\\n\\ninto thinking a gun transfer is legal when it is not, this bill \\nprovides law-abiding gun owners with a false sense of immunity.\\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this totally and completely \\nunconstitutional legislation that would deprive people of their \\nconstitutional rights to keep and bear arms.\", cat_list={'Families & Children', 'Civil Rights'})\n",

And, again, Mr. Thompson, as chair of the Gun Violence Prevention \\nTask Force; he has worked in a bipartisan way to protect our \\ncommunities, and we are grateful to him for that.\\n  We can do all the inside maneuvering that we want, and that is really \\nimportant and essential, but, without the outside mobilization, we \\ncannot enjoy the success of saving lives and making progress. So I want \\nto thank the courageous advocates who are here today, in the gallery, \\nincluding March for Our Lives and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in \\nAmerica, and so many more. They have made a complete difference.\\n  As President Lincoln said: ``Public sentiment is everything.

Gun violence does not \\ndiscriminate by party or politics. It reaches into all of our \\ncommunities, our schools, our places of worship, our workplaces, and \\nour streets, and it will require all of our courage to defeat it.\\n\\n  Last night, we were at an occasion to mark the 25th anniversary of \\nthe Brady Bill.

Yet, the Brady Bill does not stop people from purchasing \\nguns from unlicensed sellers without a background check at gun shows \\nand online.\\n  We must pass H.R. 8 to close this dangerous loophole and keep our \\ncommunities safe from gun violence. That is what we are intending to do \\ntoday.\\n\\n\\n  George Bernard Shaw said that: ``It is the mark of a truly \\nintelligent person to be moved by statistics,'' and here are the facts:\\n  Nearly 40,000 lives are cut short every year from gun violence.\\n  An average of 47 children and teenagers are killed by guns every \\nsingle day.

Every day 47 children and teenagers killed by \\nguns.\\n  And, again, another figure, hearkening back to 90 percent of the \\nAmerican people want commonsense universal background checks.\\n  The statistics spell out the stories, but it is the human personal \\nstories that change minds.\\n  How moving it was to hear our colleague, Congresswoman McBath, with \\nher generosity of spirit tell her personal story of losing her son, \\nJordan--I can't even imagine carrying that burden--but turning her \\ngrief and her tragedy into action and courage to run for Congress, to \\nstand on this floor and share her personal story with us. That takes \\nreal courage.\\n  Let's hope that we all have the courage to save children's lives, \\neveryone's lives in our country whose deaths can be avoided.\\n  There is no person in this body whose political survival is more \\nimportant than the survival of our children.\\n  We are grateful, again, to the young people, parents, survivors \\nacross America who have told their stories, marched for their lives, \\nand demanded change. This bill delivers that change, ensuring that \\npeople who are a danger to themselves and others cannot purchase a gun \\nand perpetuate violence in our communities.\\n  This week, the House will build on this progress by passing another \\nbipartisan background check bill. We must close the Charleston loophole \\nthat enabled the horrific hate crime at Emanuel African Methodist \\nEpiscopal Church.\\n  We salute the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, for his leadership on H.R. \\n1112.\\n  Tomorrow, we will vote on that. That is another part of strengthening \\nthe background check provisions.\\n  As Members of Congress, again, we take an oath to protect and defend \\nthe Constitution, the American people. To honor that oath, to honor the \\nvictims of gun violence and their families, Congress must take real \\naction on this floor. Today, we must pass this bill and take the first \\nsteps toward ending the senseless crisis of gun violence in our Nation.\\n  Again, I hope that all of us will have the courage to save lives, \\nremembering that no one's political survival here is more important \\nthan the survival of the American people--especially our children.\\n  I urge a strong bipartisan ``yes'' vote and pray that we can do the \\nright thing and send a clear message to the families of those who have \\nlost their loved ones to gun violence, that we have crossed a threshold \\nhere today to reduce gun violence in our country and take more steps to \\nimprove the safety of the American people, honoring the Constitution of \\nthe United States, respectful of our hunters and the need for people to \\ndefend themselves, but doing so in a way that does not endanger others.\", cat_list={'Other', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

It closes \\nthe gun show loophole. It gives exemptions for the issues of domestic \\nviolence and sexual assault. It allows families to transfer, and \\nranchers, farmers, and fishers to transfer.\\n  My God, what more do we want? People have died. Are we not going to \\nshow that we are committed to saving lives, not to abuse the Second \\nAmendment, to misuse it? We can bear arms. But the question is whether \\nor not we will recognize that there are 350-plus million Americans, and \\nthere are more guns in this country than there are citizens.\\n  I beg of my colleagues: Stop the violence. Vote for this bill.\\n  Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an \\noriginal co-sponsor, I rise in strong of H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan \\nBackground Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that strengthens the \\nbackground check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.\\n  A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms \\nacquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not \\nrequired to run a background check and that 96 percent of inmates who \\nwere not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they \\ncommitted their crime obtained their gun this way.\\n  This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not \\nconduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers \\nsell a large number of guns.\\n  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make \\nit illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, \\nmanufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who \\nis not so licensed without a background check.\\n  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be \\nrequired to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary \\nbackground check before the transfer could be finalized.\\n  H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy means of \\nensuring firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.\\n  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) \\ndemonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks \\nSystem (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to \\n99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within \\n90 seconds.\\n  We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the \\ncountless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue \\nto claim so many innocent lives.\\n  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-\\nstraight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.\\n  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that \\nthere were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more \\nthan 2015.\\n  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about \\n11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.\\n  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and \\nviolence deterrence.\\n  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355 \\nmass shootings in 2015.\\n  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School \\nin Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.\\n  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, \\nwith at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.\\n  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large \\ncrowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las \\nVegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.\\n  On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist \\nChurch in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old \\nDevin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.\\n  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, \\nresulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.\\n  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--\\nas much as 114 percent higher than other states.\\n  A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found \\nthat for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate, \\nthere is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.\\n  Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such \\nas safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.\\n  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.\\n  This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the \\nsolution.\\n  Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the \\nwrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons \\nused in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.\\n  We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are \\nthe root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.\\n  We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues \\nthat plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite \\nplague across the nation.\\n  My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement \\nafter four of his officers were shot while on duty.\\n  He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have \\naccomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun \\nviolence.\\n  Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long \\noverdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\\n  That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of \\naddressing the epidemic.\\n\\n\\n  Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the \\nproposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least \\none life, then it is worth it.\\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Congressman \\nMike Thompson, for his leadership of the Gun Violence Prevention Task \\nForce and for introducing this timely and important legislation.\\n  Congressman Thompson sat in the audience during the entirety of the \\nGun Safety Hearing on February 13, 2019, demonstrating his longstanding \\ncommitment to the issue.\\n  Also helping to bring us to this point today is Congresswoman Robin \\nKelly of Illinois, who represents one of the most affected districts \\nwhen it comes to gun violence.\\n  She is a valiant leader who will not rest until the Congress finds \\nsolutions for communities like hers and others all over this country.\\n  I want to thank Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor from the Parkland School \\nShooting, for testifying as a witness at the House Judiciary Gun Safety \\nHearing.\\n  Her heartfelt and vivid testimony was met with a standing ovation by \\nthe crowded audience in the hearing.\\n  Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun \\nviolence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, \\nboth prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual \\nstatements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.\\n  Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the \\nquestion is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to \\naddress a public-health epidemic?''\\n  I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''\\n  We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority \\nmembers.\\n  We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.\\n  And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President \\nand the gun lobby.\\n  I am a defender and supporter of the Constitution.\\n  I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our \\ncitizens.\\n  However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest \\ndivine right of all.\\n  I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not \\nat the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and \\nlaw enforcement officials.\\n  Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to \\nundergo ``active shooter'' drills.\\n  Imagine having children in grade school today.\\n  Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious \\nlives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or \\nAR-15.\\n  Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not \\ninclude active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.\\n  We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to \\npass H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.''\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Gun Control', 'Education'})\n",

It didn't work.\\n  After the shooting just down the street at the Washington Navy Yard, \\nthe Republican-controlled House did nothing. Three of the victims of \\nthat attack were constituents of mine living in southern Maryland. Dr. \\nWendy Edmonds and Wanda Wallace are in the gallery, Mr. Chairman. They \\nare the sisters of Sylvia Fraser, a Navy Yard shooting victim.\\n  Montana Geimer, daughter of Wendi Winters, a writer for the Capital \\nGazette of which my colleague, Mr. Brown, just spoke; and Mackenzie \\nBoughey, a high school student who organized a March for Our Lives \\nrally in Anne Arundel County, are here with us today not to have a \\nmoment of silence, but to have a moment of action.\\n  Many of our districts have been painfully affected by gun violence. \\nIn St. Mary's County in Maryland, as I told you, Mr. Chairman, a \\nstudent was killed by a shooter at Great Mills High School, and a \\ncourageous school resources officer there saved countless other lives. \\nIn Annapolis, five staff members of the Capital Gazette were gunned \\ndown in their newsroom.\\n  For years, the American people have demanded action to address gun \\nviolence. After the Parkland shooting, just over a year ago, students \\nmarched in cities from coast to coast to demand that Congress protect \\nthem in the classroom, in the streets, in houses of worship, and in all \\npublic gathering places.\\n  I, as I am sure many of you have, had the opportunity to meet with \\nmany of the students who participated in the March for Our Lives and \\nheard the determination in their voices as they spoke about working to \\nachieve a future where students would no longer have to practice \\nactive-shooter drills in their schools. I found their courage and \\npersistence deeply inspiring.\\n  Now, with a change in the majority control, we are bringing to the \\nfloor legislation supported by, as I said, nine out of ten Americans, \\nincluding a majority of responsible gun owners to expand criminal \\nbackground checks to make sure that those who have a criminal past, a \\npast of violence--domestic or otherwise--a mental health problem, or \\nare on the no-fly list because they are perceived as possibly \\nterrorists, won't be able to buy a gun.\\n  Does that mean they won't get a gun?\\n  It does not. I understand that. But as I told my friend from Georgia, \\nthe moments of silence have not worked. They were appropriate, I \\nunderstand, but they didn't work.\\n\\n\\n  We will also be voting this week on legislation offered by our whip, \\nMr. Clyburn, to close the loophole that contributed to the horrific \\nmass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston in 2015.\\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass the \\nlegislation we advance, and I call on the President to sign it without \\ndelay.\\n  Mr. Chairman, let us not have a moment of silence for this \\nlegislation.

Do not let us stand by one more time to lament the death of a \\nconstituent, a friend, a neighbor, a fellow citizen, who dies at the \\nhand of a gun purchased illegally or by someone who should not have a \\ngun.\\n  This is not about taking away guns. It is about preventing guns \\ngetting in the hands of people who do bad things, and we can predict \\nthat they are a danger to others. Let us not have a moment of silence \\nfor this bill.

We have \\ntalked about how to solve it, and, unfortunately, this underlying bill, \\nas I have brought out many times already, will not do this. We have \\nheard that we have to do something basically even if it won't work.\\n  Madam Speaker, I will remind this House one more time that what makes \\nyou feel good does not always heal you. When we understand that, then \\nwe can begin to move forward.\\n  What we have found this day is that this bill has many problems \\nbecause we chose to rush it to the floor because we had a deadline, and \\nwe cut off debate in committee.\\n  We found amendments offered to fix parts of this bill that do not fix \\nthem but actually make them worse.\\n  We have found out that the authors of the bill did not even know how \\nmuch was going to be fined in the bill until we actually pointed it \\nout.\\n  Now we come to the biggest part: I have been here all day listening \\nto: We have to keep criminals from having firearms. We have to keep \\ncriminals from having firearms.\\n  I will say it once more, Madam Speaker: We must keep criminals from \\nhaving firearms.\\n  I am glad to let you know, Madam Speaker, we are now giving everyone \\nin this body a chance to do just that.\\n  A similar measure was promoted. What we are simply saying is that, if \\nyou have someone who is a criminal who came into our country \\nillegally--criminal time number one--if they then try to buy or \\npurchase a firearm which they are unable to do, that is the second \\nstrike as a criminal, and what we are simply saying is, if they do \\nthat, they will be reported to ICE.\\n  Now, which Members in this body are opposed to notifying law \\nenforcement when a person prohibited from purchasing a firearm attempts \\nto do so? Are we against that? No.\\n  I believe my friends across the aisle are not. I have heard it all \\nday: We don't want criminals to have firearms.\\n  But my question to you now, Madam Speaker, is--be very careful. If \\nyou vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, you cannot go back to your \\nconstituency, no matter what is said, and say: I voted to keep illegal \\naliens, those who should not have a firearm, from having a firearm.\\n  We have heard it all day.

Hear me clearly. No matter what will be said in just a \\nmoment, no matter what the chairman or anyone else will say about this \\nbill, if you vote ``no,'' you are voting to allow someone who should \\nnot have a firearm to get away with it and not be prosecuted for it.\\n  Be very clear, Madam Speaker.

Something like 20 percent, I think the figure is, or 25 percent \\nof gun sales escape background checks.\\n  So all kinds of people who may be criminals, who may be mentally ill, \\nand who may be domestic abusers who shouldn't have guns get guns, and \\nthat results in lives forfeited. It results in people killed.\\n  This bill goes a long way toward solving that by saying we are going \\nto require background checks of everyone who gets a gun, with some \\nexceptions, with some reasonable exceptions which are in the bill.\\n  Now, along comes this motion to recommit, which is a total red \\nherring having nothing to do with the purpose of the bill, and says \\nthat, if someone fails a background check because he is illegally in \\nthis country, you should report that to ICE.\\n\\n  First of all, if he fails a background check because he is illegally \\nin the country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the \\ncountry. It means they already know that.\\n  So what is the point of reporting him? He has to be in the system as \\nillegally in the country in order to fail the background check because \\nof section (g)(5).

He has good \\n     reason\\n\\n\\n     to underline his loyalty: for almost a century, ethnic \\n     Macedonians in Greece have been objects of suspicion and, at \\n     times, persecution, even as their presence has been denied by \\n     almost everyone. Most are reluctant to speak to outsiders \\n     about their identity. To themselves and others, they're known \\n     simply as ``locals'' (dopyi), who speak a language called \\n     ``local'' (dopya). They are entirely absent from school \\n     history textbooks, have not featured in censuses since 1951 \\n     (when they were only patchily recorded, and referred to \\n     simply as ``Slavic-speakers''), and are barely mentioned in \\n     public. Most Greeks don't even know that they exist.\\n       That erasure was one reason for Greece's long-running \\n     dispute with the former Yugoslav republic now officially \\n     called the Republic of North Macedonia. The dispute was \\n     finally resolved last month by a vote in the Greek parliament \\n     ratifying (by a majority of just seven) an agreement made \\n     last June by the countries' two prime ministers. When the \\n     Greek Prime Minster, Alexis Tsipras, referred during the \\n     parliamentary debate to the existence of ``Slavomacedonians'' \\n     in Greece--at the time of World War Two--he was breaking a \\n     long-standing taboo.\\n       The use of the name ``Macedonia'' by the neighbouring \\n     nation state implicitly acknowledges that Macedonians are a \\n     people in their own right, and opens the door to hard \\n     questions about the history of Greece's own Macedonian \\n     minority.\\n       When Mr. Fokas was born, the northern Greek region of \\n     Macedonia had only recently been annexed by the Greek state. \\n     Until 1913 it was part of the Ottoman Empire, with Greece, \\n     Bulgaria and Serbia all wooing its Slavic-speaking \\n     inhabitants as a means to claiming the territory. It was \\n     partly in reaction to those competing forces that a \\n     distinctive Slav Macedonian identity emerged in the late 19th \\n     and early 20th Century. As Mr. Fokas's uncle used to say, the \\n     family was ``neither Serb, nor Greek, nor Bulgarian, but \\n     Macedonian Orthodox''.\\n       In the end, the Slav Macedonians found themselves divided \\n     between those three new states. In Greece, some were \\n     expelled; those who remained were pushed to assimilate. All \\n     villages and towns with non-Greek names were given new ones, \\n     chosen by a committee of scholars in the late 1920s, though \\n     almost a century later some ``locals'' still use the old \\n     ones.\\n       In 1936, when Mr. Fokas was nine years old, the Greek \\n     dictator Ioannis Metaxas (an admirer of Mussolini) banned the \\n     Macedonian language, and forced Macedonian-speakers to change \\n     their names to Greek ones. Mr. Fokas remembers policemen \\n     eavesdropping on mourners at funerals and listening at \\n     windows to catch anyone speaking or singing in the forbidden \\n     tongue. There were lawsuits, threats and beatings.\\n       Women--who often spoke no Greek--would cover their mouths \\n     with their headscarves to muffle their speech, but Mr. \\n     Fokas's mother was arrested and fined 250 drachmas, a big sum \\n     back then.\\n       ``Slavic-speakers suffered a lot from the Greeks under \\n     Metaxas,'' he says. ``Twenty people from this village, the \\n     heads of the big families, were exiled to the island of \\n     Chios. My father-in-law was one of them.'' They were tortured \\n     by being forced to drink castor oil, a powerful laxative.\\n       When Germany, Italy and Bulgaria invaded Greece in 1941, \\n     some Slavic-speakers welcomed the Bulgarians as potential \\n     liberators from Metaxas's repressive regime. But many soon \\n     joined the resistance, led by the Communist Party (which at \\n     that time supported the Macedonian minority) and continued \\n     fighting with the Communists in the civil war that followed \\n     the Axis occupation. (Bulgaria annexed the eastern part of \\n     Greek Macedonia from 1941 to 1944, committing many \\n     atrocities; many Greeks wrongly attribute these to \\n     Macedonians, whom they identify as Bulgarians.)\\n       When the Communists were finally defeated, severe reprisals \\n     followed for anyone associated with the resistance or the \\n     left.\\n       ``Macedonians paid more than anyone for the civil war,'' \\n     Mr. Fokas says. ``Eight people were court-martialled and \\n     executed from this village, eight from the next village, 23 \\n     from the one opposite. They killed a grandfather and his \\n     grandson, just 18 years old.''\\n       Mr. Fokas was a student in Thessaloniki then--but he too \\n     was arrested and spent three years on the prison island of \\n     Makronisos, not because of anything he'd done but because his \\n     mother had helped her brother-in-law escape through the \\n     skylight of a cafe where he was being held.\\n       Most of the prisoners on Makronisos were Greek leftists, \\n     and were pressed to sign declarations of repentance for their \\n     alleged Communist past. Those who refused were made to crawl \\n     under barbed wire, or beaten with thick bamboo canes. \\n     ``Terrible things were done,'' Mr. Fokas says. ``But we \\n     mustn't talk about them. It's an insult to Greek \\n     civilisation. It harms Greece's good name.''\\n       Tens of thousands of fighters with the Democratic Army, \\n     about half of them Slavic-speakers, went into exile in \\n     Eastern bloc countries during and after the civil war. About \\n     20,000 children were taken across the border by the \\n     Communists, whether for their protection or as reserve troops \\n     for a future counter-attack.\\n       Many Slavic-speaking civilians also went north for safety. \\n     Entire villages were left empty, like the old settlement of \\n     Krystallopigi (Smrdes in Macedonian) near the Albanian \\n     border, where only the imposing church of St. George stands \\n     witness to a population that once numbered more than 1,500 \\n     souls.\\n       In 1982, more than 30 years after the conflict's end, \\n     Greece's socialist government issued a decree allowing civil \\n     war refugees to return--but only those who were ``of Greek \\n     ethnicity''. Ethnic Macedonians from Greece remained shut out \\n     of their country, their villages and their land; families \\n     separated by the war were never reunited.\\n       Mr. Fokas's father-in-law and brother-in-law both died in \\n     Skopje. But, he points out, that decree tacitly recognised \\n     that there were ethnic Macedonians in Greece, even though the \\n     state never officially recognised their existence: ``Those \\n     war refugees left children, grandchildren, fathers, mothers \\n     behind. What were they, if not Macedonians?''\\n       It's impossible accurately to calculate the number of \\n     Slavic-speakers or descendants of ethnic Macedonians in \\n     Greece. Historian Leonidas Embiricos estimates that more than \\n     100,000 still live in the Greek region of Macedonia, though \\n     only 10,000 to 20,000 would identify openly as members of a \\n     minority--and many others are proud Greek nationalists.\\n       The Macedonian language hasn't officially been banned in \\n     Greece for decades, but the fear still lingers. A middle-aged \\n     man I met in a village near the reed beds of Lake Prespa, \\n     where the agreement between Greece and the North Macedonian \\n     republic was first signed last June, explained that this fear \\n     is passed down through the generations. ``My parents didn't \\n     speak the language at home in case I picked it up and spoke \\n     it in public. To protect me. We don't even remember why we're \\n     afraid any more,'' he said. Slowly the language is dying. \\n     Years of repression pushed it indoors; assimilation is \\n     finishing the job.\\n       And yet speaking or singing in Macedonian can still be \\n     cause for harassment. Mr. Fokas' son is a musician; he plays \\n     the haunting Macedonian flute for us as his own small son \\n     looks on. He and a group of friends used to host an \\n     international music festival in the village square, with \\n     bands from as far away as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.\\n       ``After those bands had played we'd have a party and play \\n     Macedonian songs,'' he says. ``None of them were nationalist \\n     or separatist songs--we would never allow that. But in 2008, \\n     just as we were expecting the foreign musicians to arrive, \\n     the local authority suddenly banned us from holding the \\n     festival in the square, even though other people--the very \\n     ones who wanted us banned--still hold their own events \\n     there.''\\n       At the last minute, the festival was moved to a field \\n     outside the village, among the reeds and marshes, without \\n     proper facilities--which, Mr. Fokas's son points out, only \\n     made Greece look bad.\\n       ``And do you know why the songs are banned in the square \\n     but not the fields outside?'' his father adds. ``Because \\n     around the square there are cafes, and local people could sit \\n     there and watch and listen secretly. But outside the village \\n     they were afraid to join in--they would have drawn attention \\n     to themselves by doing that.''\\n       The ratification of Greece's agreement with the Republic of \\n     North Macedonia--and its implicit recognition of a Macedonian \\n     language and ethnicity--is a major political breakthrough \\n     which should help to alleviate such fears. But the process \\n     has also sparked new waves of anger and anxiety, with large, \\n     sometimes violent protests opposing the agreement, supported \\n     by parts of the Orthodox church.\\n       An election is due before the end of the year. Greece's \\n     right-wing opposition has been quick to capitalise on \\n     nationalist sentiments, accusing the Syriza government of \\n     treason and betrayal. For Greece's Slavic-speakers, who have \\n     long sought nothing more than the right to cultural \\n     expression, the time to emerge from the shadows may not quite \\n     yet have arrived.\\n       Mr. Fokas has been referred to by his first name to protect \\n     his identity.\\n\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1264, text=\"  Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to \\nhighlight the visionary and unwavering leadership of Civil Rights icon \\nand notable Oklahoman, Ms. Clara Luper. Six months ago, I got to \\nwitness history, as Oklahoma City commemorated the 60th anniversary of \\nthe sit-ins she organized. And even as a 5th generation Oklahoman, I \\nrealized how little I knew.\\n  Clara Luper and her students sparked a movement: the sit-ins that led \\ninto our nation's civil rights movement. They deserve to be a household \\nname.\\n  Clara Luper made her mark in a time where people of color couldn't \\neven walk into the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They were \\nrelegated to hidden back doors. But she had a vision for equality, a \\nheart for service, and a commitment to justice. She, in her words, \\n``believed in a sun when it didn't shine, and the rain when it didn't \\nfall.'' She knew that Oklahoma and this country could be a place where \\neveryone is treated with respect, dignity, and humanity.\\n\\n\\n  As a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer Oklahoma, she \\ninstilled those principles into her students. Her steadfast commitment \\nto ending racism and systemic discrimination inspired her to organize \\nAmerica's first sit in.\\n  In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP walked up to a lunch counter \\nthey knew would refuse them, and they ordered a hamburger and a Coke. \\nThey were denied, but they did not waver. They knew what was on the \\nline. In Ms. Luper's words, ``within that hamburger was the whole \\nessence of democracy.''\\n  At their own personal peril, they returned each day with more people \\nuntil they broke the barrier. It was never easy. The protestors were \\nverbally and physically assaulted. Ms. Luper received death threats.\\n  Because of Ms. Luper and her students' fearlessness and \\ndetermination, Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters not \\njust in Oklahoma City, but in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa too. When the \\n1958 sit-in happened in Oklahoma City, a group of college students were \\ninspired by what had taken place in Oklahoma City and took note. So in \\n1961 the students launched the Greensboro, N.C. sit-in at the Woolworth \\nlunch counter--which fueled momentum within the civil rights movement.\\n  It didn't end there. For years, Ms. Luper and others continued their \\nfight. The sacrifices continued too. Authorities arrested Luper 26 \\ntimes during her fight for freedom.\\n  Clara Luper empowered young people to imagine a future brighter than \\ntheir present and taught them how to make that future a reality. She \\nchanged lives and planted seeds of ethical leadership into those who \\nwere lucky to be mentored by her. Each of her former students talks \\nabout the pivotal role Ms. Luper played in instilling confidence, \\ncharacter, and dignity in them.\\n  Generations reap the benefits of her sacrifice and the efforts to \\nintegrate not only businesses in Oklahoma City, but educational spaces. \\nMs. Luper integrated the History department at the University of \\nOklahoma, becoming the first Black graduate of that Master's program.\\n  Her contributions are reflected across our state: in a namesake \\nscholarship program at Oklahoma City University, a Corridor on the \\nnortheast side of Oklahoma City, a classroom at the University of \\nCentral Oklahoma, designating the Oklahoma City Public Schools District \\nbuilding as the Clara Luper Center, and naming the African American \\nstudies department at the University of Oklahoma after her.\\n  As a lifelong Oklahoman, the representative of the fifth \\nCongressional District, and as an American, I recognize how we are \\nbeneficiaries of Clara Luper's efforts to create a more just and \\nequitable place to live. I cannot and will not take that history and \\nher impact for granted.\\n  Although we've come so far because of her sacrifices and the \\nsacrifices of other heroes during the Civil Rights Era, there's still \\nso much work left to do. Even with the numerous accolades given to her, \\nthe best way that we can honor Ms. Clara Luper is to uphold her legacy \\nthrough a commitment to justice and equality in the policies that we \\npropose. She knew that democracy isn't a spectator sport. It is our \\nduty as a Congress and as Americans to make good on the constitutional \\npromise of establishing justice and ensuring domestic tranquility. So \\nwe must continue to work for an inclusive, equitable place for everyone \\nto live and feel safe as well as build an economy where every American \\nhas the opportunity to thrive.

      "Pandas(Index=1268, text=\"  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the \\nnomination of Andrew Wheeler to become Administrator of the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\\n  The day after Mr. Wheeler was named EPA Acting Administrator, I wrote \\nhim a letter. I reminded Mr. Wheeler of the opportunity he had to try a \\nnew course for that Agency after Scott Pruitt's scandal-plagued \\nadministration. Yet in the 7 months as Acting Administrator, \\nunfortunately, Mr. Wheeler has so far chosen not to reverse course at \\nEPA in too many important instances. In some cases, he has even \\naccelerated the environmental damage and regulatory zeal that his \\npredecessor began.\\n  I knew that Mr. Wheeler and I would not always agree on every issue, \\nbut like so many others, I did hope that he would moderate some of \\nScott Pruitt's most egregious and environmentally destructive policies, \\nspecifically on policies where industry and the environmental community \\nare in broad agreement. Sadly, my hopes have not been realized.\\n  To be clear, Mr. Wheeler is not the ethically bereft embarrassment \\nthat Scott Pruitt was. Mr. Wheeler has also engaged more frequently and \\nsubstantively than Scott Pruitt did with both Congress and EPA career \\nstaff, but time and again, Mr. Wheeler has proven that his \\nenvironmental policies are almost as destructive and extreme as his \\npredecessor's, despite the explicit promises Mr. Wheeler has made to \\nMembers of Congress, both in private and in public meetings.\\n  One of those promises was Mr. Wheeler's recent insistence that, when \\nit comes to getting a deal on vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas \\nstandards with California and a coalition of 12 other States, including \\nmy State and the Presiding Officer's State, ``no one wants a 50-State \\ndeal more than I do.'' That was Mr. Wheeler's promise during his \\nnomination hearing in front of the Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee in January.\\n  Just weeks later, the headlines told a different story. For months, \\nMr. Wheeler said repeatedly that he shared my goal of striking a deal--\\nnot just my goal, but the goal of many of us here--with the State of \\nCalifornia and a dozen of other States on fuel economy and greenhouse \\ngas emissions standards. Not long after he became Acting Administrator, \\nhowever, Mr. Wheeler signed off on the Trump administration's proposal \\nthat freezes the standards for the better part of a decade, eliminates \\nmost of the air conditioning, electric vehicle, and other compliance \\ncredits that are supported by chemical companies, automobile and parts \\nmanufacturers, and utilities and preempts California's authority to set \\nits own stronger standards.\\n  What is more, the Trump administration reportedly plans to penalize \\nrules that call for a 0.5-percent increase. That is a one-half of 1-\\npercent increase in the stringency of those standards--one-tenth the \\npace called for in the rules that are already on the books.\\n  Since that proposal was put forth, the entire automobile industry, \\nmany Members of Congress, and many other stakeholders have repeatedly \\nasked the EPA to forge a compromise that avoids years of costly \\nlitigation and uncertainty for our automobile industry. So far, that is \\nall for naught.\\n  Just last week, unfortunately and inexplicably, EPA announced, with \\nthe\\n\\n\\nWhite House and the Department of Transportation, that they decided to \\nend their so-called negotiations with the State of California and, \\neffectively, with 12 other States. These negotiations were superficial, \\nat best, or duplicitous and designed to fail, at worst. Between you and \\nme, I don't see how these discussions could have ended or failed \\nbecause they never seriously began in the first place. It is \\noutrageous.\\n  That brings me back to Mr. Wheeler's promise. After his emphatic \\ninsistence that he wanted to find a 50-State solution for these \\nstandards, the decision to end them without ever making a serious \\neffort to ever reach a compromise sends a clear message that, sadly, \\nMr. Wheeler--at least, in this instance--is unable to keep his word. I \\nsay that with no joy, but I say it nonetheless.\\n  A second example of Mr. Wheeler's failure to lead in an appropriate \\nway lies in his unreasonable opposition to submitting to the Senate for \\nratification something called a the ``Kigali Amendment'' to the \\nMontreal Protocol.\\n  I mentioned this to one of our colleagues. He said: Talk to me in \\nEnglish.\\n  I reminded him that we used to use something called CFCs. It was a \\nrefrigerator coolant that was broadly used in this country until we \\nfound out it had very serious consequences for our ozone layer. \\nScience, chemical companies, and chemists came up with a replacement to \\nCFCs. We call them HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, which are better for \\nthe ozone. They are still destructive to the greenhouse gas and \\ndestructive to our planet. Well, guess what. Scientists and chemists \\nhave, again, come up with a follow-on product to HFCs. It is not \\nscientists and chemists in companies in other countries. They are right \\nhere in America. They have invested in a lot of money to come up with \\nthis discovery, this invention. They want to sell it. That requires the \\nphaseout over time of HFCs.\\n  We need the Kigali Amendment to be submitted to the Senate for \\nratification in order to open the door for our American companies to \\ncompete with a new technology that is good for jobs in America and good \\nfor our planet. Our country could gain 150,000 direct and indirect new \\njobs, and almost $40 billion in annual economic benefits by 2027 \\nbecause the safer substitutes to HFCs are made in Texas and Louisiana. \\nThese are good-paying jobs. These are green manufacturing jobs that \\ncould help our efforts to address climate change while bolstering our \\ncountry's economy.\\n  Ratification of this treaty is supported by an extraordinary list of \\nstakeholders, including more than a dozen of our Republican colleagues \\nhere in this Chamber. From the American Chemistry Council to the \\nChamber of Commerce, to FreedomWorks, to the Sierra Club, it seems that \\njust about everyone supports ratification of this amendment, as best I \\ncan tell--everyone, that is, except EPA.\\n  Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, EPA also decided it is no longer \\n``appropriate and necessary'' to protect babies' brains from mercury \\nand air toxic pollution emitted by electric utilities.\\n  In the eleventh hour before the government shutdown, Mr. Wheeler \\nsigned a proposal that guts the legal foundation of the mercury and air \\ntoxics standards, also known as the MATS rule. Using outdated data and \\ndeciding that some benefits--like reduction in cancer, birth defects, \\nand asthma attacks--are no longer important for the Agency to count, \\nEPA is now setting a dangerous precedent and putting the mercury and \\nair toxics standards rule in legal jeopardy. In fact, EPA has gone so \\nfar as to request public comment on whether the standards should be \\neliminated altogether.\\n  Mr. Wheeler says that this action was necessary and that the proposal \\nstrikes a balance. That is just not true. In fact, the utility industry \\nis in full compliance with these standards already, and they have done \\nso at a third of the expected costs. That is why every stakeholder--\\nfrom coal-fired utilities that comply with the rules to religious \\nleaders, to environmental organizations, to the Chamber of Commerce--\\nurged this administration not to take this step. In fact, utility \\ngroups and organized labor organizations wrote to EPA saying:\\n\\n       The industry already has invested significant capital--\\n     estimated at more than $18 billion--in addition to these \\n     operating costs, and states are relying on the operation of \\n     these controls for their air quality plans. Therefore, we--\\n\\n  This being the group that wrote to EPA, including utility groups and \\norganized labor groups--\\n\\n     urge EPA to . . . leave the underlying MATS rule in place and \\n     effective.\\n\\n  Yet Mr. Wheeler has chosen to ignore the chorus of stakeholders who \\nall hoped he would chart a more responsible path--on this front, too--\\neven though utilities are not asking for this action that he is taking \\nand the EPA is taking, and the courts are not requiring it.\\n  Yet, from the stakeholders, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the \\nutility industry over here to all of the NGOs and environmental groups \\nand health groups over here, everybody says to leave this rule alone. \\nIt was adopted 7 years ago, and it works. It has worked at half the \\ncost or at one-third of the cost. Leave it alone. I just don't get \\nthis. This is just another example of when Mr. Wheeler has taken a \\nrecklessly and unnecessary extreme course of action at the EPA.\\n  Here is another one.\\n  In May of 2018, after meeting with a victim's mother, Scott Pruitt, \\nthe former EPA Administrator, announced plans to finalize the Obama \\nadministration's ban to prohibit consumer and commercial paint \\nstripping uses for something called methylene chloride--a hazardous \\nchemical that has killed dozens of unsuspecting users in this country \\nalone.\\n  Despite explicit assurances provided to my office and others that the \\nEPA would follow through with Mr. Pruitt's promise to protect both \\nconsumer and commercial users from methylene chloride, under Mr. \\nWheeler's leadership, the EPA sent a final rule restricting only the \\nconsumer uses of methylene chloride to the White House's Office of \\nManagement and Budget. There have been 56 accidental exposure deaths \\nrelated to methylene chloride since 1980--56--including properly \\ntrained workers who have worn protective gear on the job. Yet the EPA, \\nunder Mr. Wheeler's leadership, has decided to exempt workers from the \\nmethylene chloride ban.\\n  A number of people have said to me they think it is unconscionable. I \\nthink they are right. With Mr. Wheeler at the helm, the EPA cannot even \\nmanage to ban a chemical that is so harmful to human health that \\nstores--and this includes Walmart, Sherwin-Williams, Ace Hardware, Home \\nDepot, and others--have already voluntarily taken it off their shelves.\\n  That is not all. Even the EPA's recently announced PFAS Action Plan, \\nwhich was released with much fanfare 2 weeks ago, did not do much more \\nthan renounce the same measures announced by Scott Pruitt almost a year \\nago. PFAS is sometimes referred to as forever chemicals. The reason, my \\ncolleagues, is that they last forever in our environment. It took a \\npublic outcry to make Mr. Wheeler reverse the Agency's inexplicable \\ndecision not to set an enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS. At \\nhis hearing last month, I asked him if he would agree to set a clean \\ndrinking water standard in 2 years--not in 2 weeks, not in 2 months but \\nin 2 years--and he could not do that.\\n  In short, over the past 7 months as the Acting Administrator, Mr. \\nWheeler has perpetuated and in at least one instance I have cited here \\ntoday has worsened the preexisting inadequacies and failures Scott \\nPruitt left behind. When faced with opportunities to protect human \\nhealth and the environment in ways that also have the support of the \\nindustries that would be regulated, time and again, Mr. Wheeler has \\nfailed to act in a way that I believe is responsible and has, instead, \\nlistened to some of the most extreme voices around him.\\n  As I have said before and will say again, I am not making some futile \\nattempt at changing the hearts and minds about this nominee at the \\neleventh hour. I am not that kind of Senator and never have been, and I \\nwas not that kind of Governor. I am not grandstanding, trying to get \\nany press attention, or the perfect sound bite. I am, however, trying \\nto convince some of my colleagues to seize this window of opportunity \\nwe have now to ensure that Acting Administrator Wheeler reverses course \\nand governs responsibly\\n\\n\\nat the EPA. That is what I am trying to do. That is what we are trying \\nto do.\\n  As the President's nominee to lead this Agency, under the provisions \\nof the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Wheeler can continue to lead \\nthe EPA as Acting Administrator until August 7 of this year. He is \\nthere, and he is going to be there. Rushing to judgment on this \\nnomination will close the window of opportunity we have to ensure the \\nActing Administrator reverses course at the EPA and embraces the \\ncommonsense, bipartisan policies I just laid out--policies which make \\nour environment cleaner and safer while they also create jobs and \\nstrengthen America's economy.

      "Pandas(Index=1270, text=\"  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the \\nnomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as the Administrator of the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It is the job of the EPA to protect \\nboth the environment and human health. This critically important Agency \\nneeds Senate-confirmed leadership in place.\\n  President Trump picked the right person to lead this Agency when he \\nnominated Andrew Wheeler. Since April of last year, he has served as \\nthe Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and \\nsince July of last year, he has served as the Acting Administrator of \\nthe Agency. I believe Andrew Wheeler has done an outstanding job in \\nleading the EPA over the past 7 months.\\n  During the last administration, the EPA issued punishing regulations \\nthat would hurt the economy and raise costs on families. Under Acting \\nAdministrator Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has taken a different \\napproach. The Agency is now putting forward proposals that both protect \\nour environment and allow the country's economy to flourish.\\n  Acting Administrator Wheeler has led efforts to issue commonsense \\nregulatory proposals. These include the affordable clean energy rule \\nand revising the definition of the waters of the United States. Both of \\nthese proposals show Mr. Wheeler is serious about clean air and clean \\nwater while they also show he understands there is an important role \\nfor States and local communities to play. It can't be a top-down, \\nWashington-knows-best approach.\\n  Acting Administrator Wheeler has played a critical role in \\nimplementing updates to the Toxic Substances Control Act and has taken \\nsteps to limit people's exposure to dangerous and toxic chemicals. \\nThese updates are the result of major bipartisan legislation that came \\nout of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2016.\\n  Andrew Wheeler is working to limit lead exposure as well. Last \\nDecember, he helped to unveil the Trump administration's multiagency \\neffort to reduce the number of children exposed to lead in drinking \\nwater, in consumer products, and in paint. During his tenure, the EPA \\nhas also worked to provide greater regulatory certainty to States, to \\nTribes, to communities, and to the industries it regulates.\\n  Mr. Wheeler is well qualified for the position of EPA Administrator. \\nHe has spent decades--actually, over 25 years--working in environmental \\npolicy. He has served as a career employee at the EPA as an \\nenvironmental protection specialist. This experience makes him uniquely \\nqualified to serve as the head of the Agency.\\n  After that time, he spent over a decade here on Capitol Hill. When he \\nleft the EPA, he came here to work on the Environment and Public Works \\nCommittee. He served as the staff director of the Senate Environment \\nand Public Works' Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee for 6 \\nyears. Then he spent another 6 years working as the Republican staff \\ndirector and chief counsel for the full committee under Chairman Jim \\nInhofe. After his time on the Hill, he also worked as a consultant for \\na variety of energy and environmental clients. He is very well \\nqualified, and that is a big reason his nomination has received broad \\nsupport.\\n  There are 63 agricultural and forestry groups that wrote a letter in \\nsupport of Mr. Wheeler's nomination to be the Administrator: ``It is \\nhard to imagine a more qualified individual for the role of EPA \\nadministrator, and we respectfully request that the committee move to \\nconfirm his nomination so that he may be considered by the full \\nSenate,'' they say, ``at the earliest date possible.''\\n  Mr. Wheeler has received praise from the United Mine Workers of \\nAmerica.\\n  Cecil Roberts, the union's international president, said the \\nfollowing about Mr. Wheeler: ``[H]e will be a reasonable voice within \\nthe agency, and will recognize the impact on both the workers and \\nmining communities that are directly affected as EPA develops future \\nemissions regulations.''\\n  His experience and commitment to sound environmental policies has \\nreceived recognition from the Democrats as well.\\n  Senator Carper, who is with me on the floor and was the ranking \\nmember of our committee at one point, said of Mr. Wheeler when he was \\nnominated for the Deputy Administrator's role: ``I think having worked \\nin the agency, he actually cares about the environment; the air we \\nbreathe; the water we drink; the planet on which we live.'' I agree.\\n  It is time to end the needless delays by the Senate Democrats. Andrew \\nWheeler's nomination to serve as the Deputy Administrator was delayed \\nfor months and had to be reported out of the EPW Committee twice before \\nhe was confirmed. Now the Senate Democrats are calling to delay the \\nprocess again. These delays only slow down the Agency from meeting its \\nobjectives of helping communities and protecting the environment.\\n  The EPA needs a Senate-confirmed Administrator in office. The EPA \\nAdministrator plays a central role in developing and implementing \\nprograms that are focused on meeting the EPA's mission of protecting \\nhuman health and the environment. Andrew Wheeler is well qualified to \\nlead this Agency and to serve in the President's Cabinet. He is the \\nright person to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \\nAgency, and I strongly encourage every Senator to support the \\nnomination.\\n\\n\\n                      Nomination of John L. Ryder\\n\\n  Mr. President, I also rise in support of the nomination of John L. \\nRyder to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee \\nValley Authority, the TVA.\\n  The TVA serves 9 million people in parts of seven Southeastern \\nStates. It provides affordable electricity for business customers and \\nlocal power companies, for flood control, navigation, and land \\nmanagement for the Tennessee River system, plus economic development \\nfor the region. The TVA is credited with transforming the region into a \\ngrowing population and a growing economic base.\\n  With over 40 years of experience as a lawyer, Mr. Ryder will be a \\nstrong complement to the TVA's Board of Directors. The Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee attested to this fact when it reported his \\nnomination favorably to the Senate by a voice vote twice--first, on May \\n22, 2018, during the 115th Congress, and the next on February 5 of this \\nyear after he had to be renominated during this Congress because of the \\ndelays in the nomination approval process last year. Mr. Ryder is \\nanother example of how the confirmation process has deliberately run \\naground. Mr. Ryder, in normal times, would have been confirmed and in \\noffice last summer. Instead, we have to go through a cloture vote on a \\nwell-qualified nominee who has twice been reported unanimously through \\nthe Environment and Public Works Committee.\\n  Let's not delay this any longer. I urge my colleagues to vote with me \\nin supporting the nomination of John L. Ryder to be a member of the \\nBoard of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1272, text=\"  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, later today, the House of Representatives \\nwill pass a proposal that will be supported by 95, 97 percent of \\nAmericans.\\n\\n\\nThis is a proposal to make sure anybody in this country who wants to \\nbuy a gun in a legitimate transaction has to go through a background \\ncheck--a background check that in 90 percent of the cases takes less \\nthan 5 minutes of time. That background check will assure that only \\npeople who should be buying guns and owning guns will be buying and \\nowning guns--people who don't have violent criminal histories and \\npeople who don't have histories of serious mental illness. It is a \\npopular proposal. It is an impactful proposal. It will save thousands \\nof lives all across this country.\\n  I have come down to the floor to just remind my colleagues as to why \\nthis is so important, and I want to tell a quick story to try to put a \\nlittle meat on the bone when it comes to this conversation we are \\nhaving about the importance of making sure people go through background \\nchecks before they buy weapons.\\n  Mr. President, 2008 to 2012 was a period of time in this country's \\nhistory where violence was declining. Homicides were declining. Gun \\nmurders were declining. They were declining across the country. \\nSpecifically during that period of time, they were declining in the \\nMidwest. Yet there was one State that stood out as a curious outlier \\nduring that period of time, and that was the State of Missouri.\\n  In the State of Missouri, there was a dramatic jump during this \\nperiod of time in gun homicides. In fact, it happened right away after \\n2007. In 2008 and 2009, about 50 to 60 to 70 additional people every \\nyear were being murdered with guns inside Missouri. A researcher from \\nJohns Hopkins went to try to figure out why this was, and I think it is \\nimportant to tell that story on the floor today.\\n  Let me give a little historical context first. During the Civil War, \\nMissouri was one of the most violent, most dangerous places in the \\ncountry because there were these outlaws, these renegades of \\nConfederates who were out in the bush--they call them the \\nbushwhackers--who were doing regular battle with Union troops. It was \\none of the first instances of true, sustained guerilla warfare in this \\nNation. When the Civil War was over, they didn't go home. They had been \\nbrutally put down by the Union, but they stuck, and they formed their \\nown smaller criminal enterprises.\\n  We know about this because Jesse James and his brother Frank were \\namongst those who made their name as bushwhackers fighting the Union \\nand then turned into criminals who robbed stage coaches and banks and \\ntrains.\\n  To combat this post-Civil War continuation of violence, Missouri \\ndecided to change its firearms laws, and it started with a crackdown on \\nthe ability of individuals to conceal weapons. It extended to a change \\nin the Constitution to make it perfectly clear that Missouri \\npoliticians had the ability to limit who could own guns and who \\ncouldn't.\\n  Eventually, a provision got passed that said that in order to own a \\nhandgun, you had to get a permit from your local authority. As time \\nwent on, that permit came to include a background check, so that if you \\nwanted to own a gun in Missouri, you had to go and get a background \\ncheck. You had to prove you did not have a serious criminal history or \\na serious history of mental illness.\\n  What happened in 2007 was that, very quietly, that provision got \\nrepealed. It was part of a much louder effort to repeal a whole host of \\ngun laws in Missouri. Missouri kind of became the epicenter of the \\nNRA's focus in the 2000s. It was this Southern--semi-Southern State \\nthat still had pretty tough gun laws, and the NRA went all in and had \\ntheir annual convention in St. Louis and spent millions of dollars \\ntrying to elect folks who would sign laws they were pushing through the \\nlegislature. In 2007, they finally got their way. They got all these \\nlaws that had been passed since the Civil War repealed. One of them was \\nthe law that required you to get a background check before you could \\nbuy a gun.\\n  The researcher from Johns Hopkins sort of looked at all these laws, \\ncontrolled for all sorts of other factors, and came to the conclusion--\\nyou should read the paper; it is very well done--that it was this \\nprovision which removed the background check that led to this dramatic \\nspike in violence. He has all sorts of interesting data to show why \\nthat is. All the other violent crime in Missouri stayed flat from 2008 \\nto 2012, but gun crimes spiked. All of a sudden, guns bought in \\nMissouri were being used in crimes all over the region. Other States \\nstarted to report an increase--a curious, sudden increase--in crime \\nguns that were bought in Missouri. Well, guess why. It was because all \\nof a sudden, you didn't have to get a background check if you wanted to \\nbuy a gun in Missouri. All of a sudden, criminals and people with \\nserious mental illnesses could get guns through gun shows and internet \\nsales--transactions on the private market--without that background \\ncheck.\\n  I tell this story because I hear opponents of this bill in the House \\nsaying: This isn't meaningful. It won't work. These mass shootings \\nweren't perpetuated with weapons that were bought without background \\nchecks.\\n  Well, that is true. This one public policy intervention won't stop \\nevery single bad thing that happens in this country. But the data is \\nthe data, and it shows us that States that have background checks have \\ndramatically lower rates of gun crime than States that don't have them.\\n  A little bit earlier than the changes made in Missouri, my State of \\nConnecticut made the opposite change. My State of Connecticut made a \\nchange to go from being a non-background check State to a background \\ncheck State. We put in a local permit that came with a background check \\nrequirement. So even if you bought your gun outside of a bricks-and-\\nmortar gun store, you had to get a permit, and that permit required you \\nto get a background check.\\n  Well, that same researcher went to Connecticut, ran all the numbers, \\nand found out that in Connecticut, after that change was made, gun \\nmurders dropped by 40 percent. They increased in Missouri by about 25 \\npercent and decreased in Connecticut by about 40 percent--and again \\ncontrolling for all sorts of other factors that could explain those \\nchanges.\\n  So on both sides of the ledger, there is what I would tell you is \\nincontrovertible evidence that a State that has background checks is \\ngoing to end up having many fewer gun crimes than a State that doesn't \\nhave them. The problem is, as we saw in and around Missouri, guns don't \\nrespect borders, so when Missouri dropped its gun background check \\nrequirement, those guns started moving into other States.\\n  That is what happened in my State. The guns that are used to commit \\ncrimes in our cities--the guns that are trafficked out of the back of \\nvans--aren't bought from Connecticut gun stores; they are bought by \\ncriminals in other States because they know they can go to gun shows \\nand they can turn to internet sales in those other States and buy those \\nweapons.\\n\\n  The same thing happens as weapons move across our border. I have \\nheard an awful lot from this President about how dangerous Mexico and \\nCentral America are. Well, there is some truth to that, but the guns \\nthat are being used in those crimes are trafficked from the United \\nStates of America, and the way they get to the southern border is \\nthrough States that don't have background check requirements.\\n  Just go online and check out what people say who have been arrested \\nfor gun trafficking. They tell you exactly how they did it. They go to \\ngun shows in Texas. They buy guns at unregulated gun shows in Texas, \\nand they take them back across the border and sell them in Central \\nAmerica.\\n  So we have all the evidence we need--empirical evidence, anecdotal \\nevidence--to pass this piece of legislation, but maybe the most \\nimportant reason that we should pass it, that we should take it up here \\nin the Senate when it passes the House later today, is that it is just \\nso darn popular. There really isn't anything else in America today that \\nis as popular as universal background checks. The minimum score is \\nabout 90 percent. There is plenty of really good polling that says that \\n97 percent of Americans support universal background checks. Grandma \\nisn't that popular. Apple pie isn't that popular. There is nothing we \\ndebate here that gets 97 percent on agreement other than the issue of \\nbackground checks.\\n  So I am here on the floor today to try to fill in some of the details \\non why this is so important and to implore my colleagues, once it \\npasses the House of Representatives, to bring it here. Obviously, I \\nwould love to have a vote on\\n\\n\\nthe House bill, but I understand how this place works. We are going to \\nsend a letter to Chairman Graham asking him to at the very least \\nconvene a hearing on background checks in the Judiciary Committee.\\n  We came to a conclusion here in the Senate as to a bipartisan \\nbackground checks proposal that could get 50 votes--in 2013--and I \\nwould love to start that process again. But there is no reason not to \\ndo it because all the evidence tells us that when we make sure that \\nonly the right people buy guns, a lot less people die from gun crimes.\\n  This is not controversial anywhere except for Washington, DC. \\nEverybody out there in the American public wants us to pass universal \\nbackground checks. Maybe some other interventions in this space are a \\nlittle bit more controversial, split folks a little bit more, but not \\nbackground checks. This thing is decided outside of the Senate Chamber \\nand the House Chamber. Popular in the public, deeply impactful, will \\nsave thousands of lives--that is a triple we don't get very often here, \\nand we should take advantage of the opportunity.\\n  Let me leave you with this: I convened a panel a couple of nights ago \\nto talk about the importance of background checks, and there were a \\nnumber of parents of those who were lost to gun violence. One of the \\nparents was from Sandy Hook. Another was a parent of a child who was \\nkilled in Chicago, and she really wanted to make sure we knew what the \\nreal impact of gun violence in America was. She wanted to make sure we \\nknew that the victims aren't just those who show up on the police \\nblotter; the victims are the parents and the brothers and the sisters \\nand the friends and the coworkers.\\n  The average number of people who experience some diagnosable trauma \\nwhen somebody in their life is shot and killed is 20. So when you hear \\nthe number that 100 people in the United States die every day from \\nguns--which is a number 10 to 20 times higher than in any other high-\\nincome nation on a per capita basis--you have to understand that number \\nisn't really 100; that number is 20 times higher than that because the \\npeople who have to live with that loss have to ask these questions: Why \\ndid they shoot themselves? What do I do about that individual who shot \\nmy son? How do I get over that combination of pain and anger? That is \\nhard to understand unless you have spent time with the mothers and the \\nfathers who will be dealing with this catastrophic, life-changing \\ntrauma for the rest of the time they are on this Earth.\\n  So that is why this is so serious to me. It is because we have an \\nanswer for their pain--not an answer that will stop every gun crime in \\nthis country but an answer that will result in thousands fewer people \\ndying. We know that because the evidence tells us that. And I can't \\nexplain to these families--to that mother in Chicago--why something \\nthat has been proven to work and is supported by 90 percent of \\nAmericans can't get a vote or a debate in the Senate.\\n  I will leave it at that for today. I hope that when this passes in \\nthe House with a big bipartisan majority, we will take advantage of the \\nopportunity to get a big bipartisan majority here in the Senate. If the \\nRepublican majority commits to starting that process, I guarantee that \\nwill be the result.\\n  I want to thank all of the people who made this possible in the House \\ntoday.\\n  For the record, I have introduced a version of H.R. 8 here in the \\nU.S. Senate.\\n  To Chairman Nadler,   Mike Thompson, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader \\nHoyer, and to their Republican cosponsors who helped bring it to the \\nfloor--I thank them on behalf of all of the folks they will never know, \\nthose lives they will save by their action today if we do the right \\nthing and take it up here in the Senate.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Technology', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Individually and collectively, \\n     these changes bring about others, ranging from disruption of \\n     forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in \\n     populations. Witnesses before the Committee testified that \\n     the Earth is now committed to a substantial greenhouse \\n     warming, projected to be about 2 degrees Centigrade, as well \\n     as an ozone layer depletion.\\n\\n  Well, that was quite a prediction. Who were these six Senators? \\nQuentin\\n\\n\\nBurdick, Democrat from North Dakota; Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana; \\nGeorge Mitchell, Democrat from Maine; Robert Stafford, Republican from \\nVermont, the chairman then of the committee; Dave Durenberger, \\nRepublican of Minnesota; and Rhode Island's Republican Senator, John \\nChafee.\\n  You cannot help but be struck that the prediction back then by these \\nsix Senators is now our reality. Everything they predicted is \\nhappening. The scientists they listened to had it right. Global \\ntemperatures have already risen by around 1 degree Celsius, and we are \\nheaded to over 2 degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the \\ncentury.\\n  Their grim predictions, which we now live with as fact, motivated \\nthese six Senators to ask the Office of Technology Assessment for \\npolicy options that ``could lead to the stabilization and minimization \\nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.''\\n  Why did they want these policy options? They wanted to learn about \\npolicy options because, as they continued in their letter:\\n\\n       Congress must soon begin to weigh the alternatives facing \\n     the United States and other nations. . . . Due to the \\n     likelihood that legislation will be considered by the \\n     Committee early in the next Congress, it would be most \\n     helpful if this analysis could be undertaken without delay.\\n\\n  ``Without delay.'' Since then, Republicans have demolished the Office \\nof Technology Assessment; that office no longer exists.

This was in 1986, some 33 years \\nago. That same year, as I am today, my wife and I were farming in North \\nCentral Montana, a farm that then had been in the family for about 70 \\nyears.\\n  During the time before 1986, and since 1986, we have seen a lot of \\nchanges on the farm. That is why it is interesting--because those \\nchanges have increased more than ever, I believe, in the last 20 years.\\n  When this letter was sent off to study solutions in 1986, it was \\nincredibly visionary because it was before climate change was even \\ntalked about much. Yet this group of Senators was able to see the \\nnegative impacts of this coming down the pike.\\n  By the way, when we talk about negative impacts of climate change--\\nyou probably have this, Senator Whitehouse, but somebody ought to put \\ntogether how many hundreds of billions of dollars we have spent on \\nnatural disasters in the last 10 or 12 years compared to how much we \\nspent in years previous. I can tell you, it was a few years ago that \\nevery State in the Union except one or maybe two had a natural \\ndisaster. That is because our climate is changing.

I don't know where the President finds these people, and I don't \\nknow how this body can support somebody who is this big of a denier, \\nwho wants to slow enforcement on polluters.\\n  There is one thing we need to keep in mind in this country when we \\ntry to put people like Wheeler up for head of EPA. If you take a look \\nat the third-world nations in this world, those are the nations that \\nhave destroyed their resource base. If you want to pollute our water \\nand if you want to pollute our air, that is destroying our resource \\nbase. I guarantee you, that is not a way to make America great. It is \\nnot even a way to keep America great.\\n  This nominee is rolling back the clean water rule. He has allowed \\nmore uses for asbestos in commerce when, in our State of Montana, Libby \\ncan tell you all about asbestos. People are still dying from its \\neffects.\\n  That aside--the Wheeler nomination, which is a catastrophe in \\nitself--I could tell you that the Senators who stood on this very floor \\n33 years ago understood--understood--that we have a challenge in front \\nof us greater than any other challenge we have faced before, and that \\nis climate. As we talk about what they did in 1986--we are in 2019 \\nnow--now is the time to come up with some workable solutions--workable \\nfor our climate and workable for our economy--to get our arms around \\nthis very serious problem.\\n  I am going to tell you what is at risk here.

We raise \\nsome of the best wheat and the best cattle and the best post-crops in \\nthe world, but it takes a predictable environment to do that.

They said: Study the issue of \\nclimate change and make recommendations to avert global disaster.\\n  Those Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, were concerned that \\nhuman activity might directly cause permanent, destructive, and \\nwidespread changes to our planet's climate system--changes that would \\nput our entire economy, ecosystem, and, our very own existence at risk.\\n  As I said, one of these Senators was my senior Senator, my mentor, \\nwhen I came here and one of the finest Senators who ever served--\\nRepublican Robert Stafford, from Vermont.\\n  Today, led by Senator Whitehouse, I think that what many of us are \\ntrying to do is what Senator Chafee and Senator Stafford did. We want \\nto recall that moment in 1986 and renew the warning those Senators \\nissued 33 years ago.\\n  Let me speak about Senator Stafford. When I came here at the ripe old \\nage of 34, I was the only Democrat ever elected in my State. Robert \\nStafford was ``Mr. Republican.'' He took me under his wing. He had been \\na Congressman. He had been a Governor. He had been an attorney general. \\nHe served in World War II and in Korea. He was a mentor, but he was \\nalso an example. His legacy is one of sensible, pragmatic Vermont \\nvalues that he brought to Washington for decades. They weren't \\nRepublican or Democratic.\\n  Senator Stafford was--like most Vermonters--a champion for the \\nnatural environment. With his work on landmark environmental \\nlegislation, like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the \\nSuperfund program, Senator Stafford represented the best of Vermont's \\ncommitment to sustainability.\\n  His appeals to reason and for common ground, and his belief in sound \\nscience resonate even more today than when he left this body three \\ndecades ago. If he were here today, I believe he would be calling on \\nboth sides of the aisle to act now to ensure that we can pass on a \\nsecure and livable planet for generations to come and to act before it \\nis too late.\\n  Today, so many people still refuse to accept what is now an \\noverwhelming scientific consensus--that climate change is real and that \\nhumans are the dominant cause of it. What is worse, for the last 2 \\nyears many in Congress have willfully accelerated the devastation \\ncaused by global warming by enabling the Trump administration's erosion \\nof our Nation's bedrock environmental protections--protections that I \\nhave fought for throughout my nearly 45 years in the Senate.\\n  As climate scientists warn of the urgent need to reduce emissions and \\nreverse the global rise in temperatures, many Senators have refused to \\npreserve even the status quo. Instead, in the last 2 years, we have \\nseen the rollback of commonsense regulations, often at the behest of \\nprivate interests that have spent decades misinforming the public and \\nsuppressing their own science on the long-term hazards of the fossil \\nfuel industry.\\n  Alarmingly, this week the Senate is poised to confirm someone to lead \\nthe Environmental Protection Agency--the Agency that is charged with \\nsafeguarding the air and water on which we depend--who, despite the \\nscientific consensus, denies that climate change is the great threat we \\nface today.\\n  To growing numbers of Americans it is saddening--actually, it is \\nmaddening--and most of all, deeply alarming that the Trump \\nadministration and many others in leadership positions have made \\nTrumpism's anti-science, know-nothing agenda their default position. \\nThis poses existential threats not only to our children and \\ngrandchildren but to our generation.\\n  More than three decades ago, long before protecting our planet became \\na partisan issue, the Environment and Public Works Committee held 3 \\ndays of hearings on climate change. Those 1986 hearings compelled a \\nbipartisan group of Senators to acknowledge and warn the public about a \\n``fundamentally altered planet'' as a result of the ``substantial \\ngreenhouse warming'' that was projected.\\n  They asked what could be done to prevent consequences ``ranging from \\ndisruption of forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in \\npopulation,'' and ``extreme weather events, such as droughts, monsoons, \\nand lowland floods.'' These words of warning were neither radical nor \\npartisan. They were sensible.\\n  So what has changed since then? The ice caps are melting--only \\nfaster. Certainly, the glaciers I saw when I visited Antarctica 25 or \\nso years ago had been there for eons, and they are now fast \\ndisappearing. Our coastline is still disappearing but faster. Farmers \\nand ranchers are still concerned about prolonged droughts and extreme \\nweather, only, today, the fires and storms are more frequent and more \\ndevastating.\\n  Just last month, the intelligence community's ``Worldwide Threat \\nAssessment'' offered a sobering conclusion. This is the intelligence \\ncommunity's assessment: ``Global environmental and ecological \\ndegradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition \\nfor resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 \\nand beyond.''\\n  We know that bipartisan action on big environmental threats is \\npossible. In fact, soon after the climate change hearings in 1986, \\nMarcelle and I climbed Vermont's Camel's Hump with President Reagan's \\nEPA Administrator. We wanted to show him the terrible damage caused by \\nacid rain. We could see that mountain from our home. We could see the \\nchanges up close. They were very obvious. With President Reagan's EPA \\nAdministrator's support, we moved ahead with the Clean Air Act \\nAmendments of 1990, and they were signed into law by President George \\nH. W. Bush. It was not a partisan issue. The result was a great \\nreduction in the scourge of acid rain. We see these results every day.\\n  Today we are in danger of taking such results for granted. It is up \\nto us to protect this planet. If we don't, who will? There is no more \\nurgent responsibility.\\n  There are bold ideas for how to address this challenge. The Green New \\nDeal offers a valuable roadmap for debate and a pathway for action. The \\ntime for dallying around the edges of the issue is over. We all share \\nresponsibility for where we are today. So, likewise, we have an \\nobligation to attack this issue, but not with cynical show votes, not \\nwith feel-good votes intended to demonstrate a political divide rather \\nthan what should be universal acknowledgment of what we know to be \\ntrue--that climate change is real, and human activity is the primary \\ncause of these threats to our way of life, our communities, and our \\nplanet.\\n  We have to channel the American innovative spirit that has improved \\nour lives for centuries. We have to find creative solutions for \\nreducing carbon emissions, and then we have to invest in those \\nsolutions. We have to reorient our workforce toward the great \\nopportunities that are opening for green-economy jobs. We should invest \\nin\\n\\n\\nleading the whole world in developing clean energy solutions. We have \\nto address this real emergency head-on. Not only can we curb climate \\nchange, but, in doing so, we can transform the American economy.\\n  Over 30 years ago, a handful of forward-looking Republicans and \\nDemocrats stood together in this Senate. I was proud to be here when \\nthey issued their challenge, but the time for delay is over. In fact, \\nour time is running out.\\n  Let this renewed vigor in addressing climate change, brought about by \\nthe bold proposed Green New Deal, be the catalyst for real change. \\nLet's stand together.\\n  Senator Whitehouse has enlightened us on so many of these issues, but \\nwe have also learned, as he did, from our mentors--like Senator Chafee, \\nSenator Stafford, and the others who got together in 1986. It is not \\npartisan and it is not political. It is survival.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Technology'})\n",

Of course, Minnesota was represented in that letter \\nby Dave Durenberger, and Minnesota is represented here on the floor \\ntoday by Senator Klobuchar.\\n  I yield to her.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1286, text=\"  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \\nfor his leadership day in and day out on this issue.\\n  I rise to join him and my other colleagues to talk about this letter \\nand to look back at that moment in time but really to do it to look \\nforward because we know it is long past time for bipartisan action on \\nclimate change.\\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island has explained with a copy of that \\nletter, back in 1986, a bipartisan group of Senators came together to \\nvoice their concerns about the future of our world.\\n  This forward-thinking group of our predecessors, who were from the \\nsame States as my colleagues who are here today, held 3 days of \\nhearings on climate change. That sounds like a pretty good idea for \\nsomething we should be doing right now. It was chaired by, of course, \\nthe Republican Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. John Chafee.\\n  Minnesota Senator David Durenberger was among that group of Senators. \\nHe was born in St. Cloud. He earned his law degree from the University \\nof Minnesota, was the top-rated cadet in his ROTC class, and served as \\na lieutenant in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps and as a captain in \\nthe U.S. Army Reserve.\\n  Senator Durenberger took over the seat left by Senator Humphrey, and \\nduring his 17 years of service in the Senate, Senator Durenberger \\nproved time and again that he is a true believer in bipartisanship. He \\nworked across the aisle to tackle big issues, and that included talking \\nabout climate change way back in 1986.\\n  I called Senator Durenberger this week to talk to him, and our staff \\ndid, to get some sense of where he was on climate change years later. \\nHe reported to us that, in his words, he wanted to remind Americans \\nthere was a time in our very recent history when the U.S. Senate made \\nit its responsibility to define and address some of the critical \\nnational and international policy issues that threaten the security of \\nour communities, our Nation, and the world.\\n  This is Senator Durenberger speaking in the year 2019. He said he \\ncould say ``without reservation that it was bipartisan Senate \\nleadership that encouraged the four Presidents with whom [he] served--\\nCarter, Reagan, [George H.W.] Bush, and Clinton--to prioritize \\nenvironmental problem definition and solution.''\\n  He also recalled working with his colleagues on the Environment and \\nPublic Works Committee to ``challenge''--and these are his words--\\n``challenge the scientific community and the business community to work \\nharder at reducing the impact [of greenhouse gases] and suggesting what \\npolicies best incentivize alternative fuels.''\\n  It was in this bipartisan spirit that this group of Senators sent a \\nletter to Dr. John Gibbons, who was then the executive director of the \\nOffice of Technology Assessment. In that letter, they talked about the \\nneed to meet ``the massive and, to some degree irrevocable, alterations \\nin the stratosphere commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect.''\\n  The letter goes on to discuss concerns about ``altered precipitation \\nand storm patterns,'' something certainly the Senator from Rhode Island \\nknows we are seeing right now. These Senators were ahead of their \\ntime--altered precipitation and storm patterns.\\n  ``[M]ore frequent and extreme weather events,'' they talked about \\nthat. Look at what we are seeing with the hurricanes, with the rising \\nsea levels, and with the wildfires in Colorado and in California.\\n  ``[D]isruption of forest, crop, and ocean productivity.'' That letter \\nmay have been sent in 1986, but certainly those Democratic and \\nRepublican Senators were ahead of their time. Americans are now \\nincreasingly feeling the effects of changing climate patterns and \\nextreme weather events. Farmers are already living through these \\ndisruptions to crop productivity.\\n  So what else did the letter say? Well, it said this: ``We are deeply \\ntroubled by the prospect of such a rapid and unprecedented change in \\nthe composition of the atmosphere and its implications for the human \\nand natural worlds.'' It also stated that ``it may be necessary to act \\nsoon to at least slow these trends or, perhaps, halt them altogether.''\\n  Think of those words way back in 1986 asking us to act soon. They \\nwere right back then, and they are still right today. The true tragedy \\nis that the final paragraph of the letter notes that any analysis \\nshould be undertaken without delay ``due to the likelihood that \\nlegislation will be seriously considered by the Committee early in the \\nnext Congress.''\\n  Well, the truth is, we are still waiting for that legislation to be \\nseriously considered. The bipartisan call in that 1986 letter came in \\nthe 99th Congress, and we are now beginning the 116th. Just as \\ntroubling, we have lost some of the bipartisan spirit that guided David \\nDurenberger and those 1986 lawmakers. Our inaction has outlasted even \\nthe Office of Technology Assessment itself.\\n  I ask my colleagues, in the spirit of bipartisanship--from back in \\n1986, my colleague Senator Durenberger, who I hope is listening today--\\nlet us continue that spirit, and let's get some serious climate \\nlegislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=1290, text=\"  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise in sadness and somewhat perplexed \\nbecause what we are doing in this colloquy is recreating a statement, a \\nletter, as the Senator from Minnesota outlined, that was sent by six of \\nour predecessors in December of 1986, warning about the dangers of \\nclimate change, warning about what this can do to our country and to \\nour world, about costs, and about how we had to take action.\\n  One of those Senators was George Mitchell of Maine, one of the great \\nlegislators of the 20th century. I am honored to be in the seat that \\nonce was occupied by George Mitchell and also by his predecessor, \\nEdmund Muskie. I think the story of the major environmental legislation \\nof the 20th century, sponsored principally at the beginning by Edmund \\nMuskie, the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, is worth mentioning, if \\nonly briefly.\\n  The most important point is that the Clean Air Act, one of the most \\nimportant and comprehensive environmental pieces of legislation in our \\nNation's history, passed this body unanimously. It passed this body \\nunanimously.\\n  It disturbs me that we couldn't agree on the time of day around here \\nunanimously these days. I don't know when this issue became a partisan \\nissue, but I deeply regret it because it is causing harm to our \\ncountry.\\n  What I would like to do is step into George Mitchell's shoes for a \\nmoment and read a statement that he himself wrote and made back in \\n1986, and you are not going to believe how prescient this statement is. \\nIt could have been written yesterday. Here are George Mitchell's words:\\n\\n       The problem of global warming is one of immense \\n     significance. It is the most serious and more pressing than \\n     anticipated. Previously, most of the models forecasting the \\n     rate of global warming focused on the air pollutants produced \\n     by the combustion of fossil fuels. More recent data suggest \\n     that trace gases may also increase the rate of warming by a \\n     factor of two. This means that warming may be increasing \\n     twice as fast as previously thought.\\n       The data produced to date suggests there may be an average \\n     increase in temperature of 1 deg.C since the beginning of the \\n     industrial revolution.\\n\\n  This was in 1986. We are now at about 1.5 degrees centigrade.\\n\\n       Considering how much warmer this June has been than \\n     average, a 1 degree difference may appear to be \\n     insignificant, but an average of 1 degree increase could be \\n     devastating, so the experts tell us. A 1 degree increase in \\n     the average global temperature would melt glaciers--\\n\\n  That is happening--\\n\\n     and such melting would increase the sea level.\\n\\n  That is happening.\\n\\n       There are uncertainties in predicting how much the sea \\n     level would increase in a particular area. In some cases, it \\n     could be an average increase of a few feet; in others, much \\n     more. For a coastal State like Maine and to other States \\n     along the coastline, such an increase would be devastating.\\n\\n  To deviate from George's words for a moment, this is what we see \\nhappening. We are now seeing what are called rainy day floods, flooding \\nin areas of our country along the coast that were rare. Six-month \\nevents are now every high tide.\\n  George Mitchell says:\\n\\n       An average of 1 degree increase in temperature could have \\n     major impacts on agriculture. This country's Midwestern bread \\n     basket could again become a dust bowl. More heat would mean \\n     less water for crops and variations in growing seasons. It is \\n     important to keep in mind that this average increase is \\n     global in nature. It is not a national or regional problem. \\n     If American farmers suffer for lack of water, so will farmers \\n     all over the planet. If shorelines along our coasts are \\n     flooded, so will shorelines everywhere in the world.\\n       The enormity of this phenomenon is staggering, and we have \\n     a responsibility to limit emissions of pollutants that trap \\n     the heat in our atmosphere. As difficult, as immense, and as \\n     seemingly remote as the problem is to our daily lives, we \\n     cannot delay.\\n\\n  This was George Mitchell in 1986--we cannot delay.\\n\\n       There will be those who argue that more research is \\n     necessary to completely understand the phenomenon and to \\n     answer every scientific question.\\n\\n  We are still hearing that argument today--we need more science; we \\nneed more studies; we are not sure.\\n  George goes on:\\n\\n       As in the case of acid rain, such complete understanding \\n     will come only after we flounder in the weight of our \\n     shortsighted policies. This is one more indication that the \\n     benefits of industrialization carry with them the burden of \\n     controlling pollutants. These pollutants threaten our lakes, \\n     fish, health, and forests today in the form of acid \\n     deposition.\\n       We will hear today that these pollutants also threaten the \\n     future of our planet, which cannot tolerate such a sudden and \\n     dramatic increase in temperature and survive in a form \\n     familiar to us.\\n\\n  In 1986 George Mitchell said:\\n\\n       Solutions are possible and available. The statement \\n     released at the conclusion of the Villach Conference in \\n     Austria last October--\\n\\n  This was in 1985--\\n\\n     addresses the common nature of some of our environmental \\n     problems. That statement said in part that ``climate change \\n     and sea level rises due to greenhouse gases are closely \\n     linked with other major environmental issues, such as acid \\n     deposition and threats to the Earth's ozone shield, mostly \\n     due to changes in the composition of the atmosphere by human \\n     activity.''\\n       Reduction in coal and oil use and energy conservation \\n     undertaken to reduce acid deposition will also lower \\n     concentration of greenhouse gases. Reductions in emissions of \\n     chlorofluorocarbons--\\n\\n  Which we achieved--\\n\\n     will help protect the ozone layer and will also slow the rate \\n     of climate change. The rate and degree of future warming \\n     could be profoundly affected by governmental policies on \\n     energy conservation, use of fossil fuels, and the emission of \\n     greenhouse gases.\\n\\n  Those words were written 32 years ago.\\n\\n       The rate and degree of future warming could be profoundly \\n     affected by governmental policies on energy conservation, use \\n     of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases.\\n\\n  The testimony that they were intending to hear at the hearing that \\nGeorge is describing demonstrated ``that such governmental policies are \\nneeded . . . nationally and on a global basis.''\\n  I pause on ``a global basis''--the tragedy of leaving the Paris \\nclimate accord, because the only solution to this problem has to be \\nlocal, national, and global.\\n  The testimony from Federal Agencies will be that the current \\ngovernment policy is to conduct more research, a familiar refrain on \\nissues of this type. George Mitchell said:\\n\\n       What is missing in the Federal effort is action. The \\n     problem of global warming brings another round of scientists \\n     before us decrying the folly of waiting until it is too late \\n     to\\n\\n\\n     prevent irreversible damage. In the case of acid rain, \\n     research has been offered as a substitute for much-needed \\n     action. This policy has produced more bodies of water that \\n     cannot sustain life, more trees that are dying, and more \\n     people who find it hard to breathe.\\n       The policy has produced more studies, not any meaningful \\n     change in policy. I hope these two days of hearings will help \\n     persuade the administration--\\n\\n  And the people of the country--\\n\\n       that inaction has its own costs, almost invariably higher \\n     than the cost of action.\\n\\n  George Mitchell was right. The cost of inaction is invariably higher \\nthan the cost of action.\\n  George concluded by saying:\\n\\n       I represent a State that already has been affected by acid \\n     deposition. I want to do all I can to keep Maine, the rest of \\n     our country, and our planet from facing potentially more \\n     dramatic environmental damage from global warming. The best \\n     way to avoid these undesirable outcomes is to begin taking \\n     action now to prevent further damage rather than spending \\n     twice as much time and later money repairing damage.\\n\\n  George Mitchell was right in 1986. Tragically, he is even more right \\ntoday because we did not heed his call. We did not take action. We have \\navoided action.\\n  I don't want to be the generation that our children and grandchildren \\nlook back on and say: Where were you and what did you do when the \\nclimate was deteriorating, when the glaciers were melting, when the ice \\nsheets were melting, when the sea level was rising, when the storms \\nwere increasing in intensity, when the wildfires were burning our \\nStates? What did you do, Senator?\\n  I, for one, want the answer to be ``I took action.'' The answer \\nshould be ``we took action.''\\n  Today, this is a challenge even greater--significantly greater--than \\nit was in 1986, but the very fact that people like Quentin Burdick, \\nGeorge Mitchell, John Chafee, Bob Stafford, and David Durenberger saw \\nthe future and predicted it so succinctly and profoundly should spur us \\nto the type of action that is necessary to meet, confront, and overcome \\nthis most serious of challenges before us.\\n  Thank you.\\n  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1303, text=\"  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the debate \\nthat we\\n\\n\\nare having with regard to the nomination or, I should say, confirmation \\nof the EPA Administrator.\\n  All of us in this Chamber and the other body, the U.S. House of \\nRepresentatives--frankly, anyone in government--has an obligation to \\nact in accordance with a goal of being good stewards of the Earth. Some \\nmight call it creation care--care of God's creation.\\n  Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency, under its current \\nleadership, is, in my judgment, failing to meet that obligation. From \\nday one, the administration has prioritized gutting environmental \\nprotections and rolling back policies that had us on a path toward a \\nmore sustainable future.\\n  From attacking the Clean Power Plan to weakening methane protection \\nstandards, this administration has repeatedly prioritized the interests \\nof polluters over the health and wellness of the American people.\\n  Andrew Wheeler, the nominee, if he is confirmed to run the EPA or, I \\nshould say, the Environmental Protection Agency, which we call the \\nEPA--this assault on clean air, clean water, and so many other \\nprotections will continue if he is, in fact, confirmed.\\n  Some of the most troubling EPA actions have come while Mr. Wheeler \\nhas been running the EPA in an acting capacity.\\n  In recent weeks, the EPA has decided to move forward with a rollback \\nof the clean car standard and to gut the mercury and air toxics rule. \\nThese moves will harm public health and the health of our children, in \\nparticular.\\n  The American Lung Association reports that 5 Pennsylvania counties, 5 \\nof our 67 counties, which are home to approximately 4 million people, \\nrank among the top 25 counties most polluted by particulate matter year \\nround.\\n  Rolling back the clean car standards and clean air standards will \\ncause more exposure to harmful pollutants that lead to increased \\nmortality, respiratory problems, emergency room visits, and work-loss \\ndays.\\n  As we know, the transportation sector is the largest source of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions in the United States. We also know that the \\nMATS rule, the so-called mercury and air toxics rule, is an \\nenvironmental and public health success story.\\n  Mercury pollution is particularly harmful for unborn children, who \\nare much more sensitive to exposure and who may suffer neurological and \\ndevelopmental problems.\\n  Powerplant mercury emissions have declined by 90 percent because of \\nthe MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of schedule and at one-third of \\nthe projected cost. Let me say that again. Powerplant mercury emissions \\nhave declined by 90 percent because of the MATS rule. This was achieved \\nahead of schedule and at one-third of the scheduled cost.\\n  Let me give testimony from two Pennsylvanians--partial testimonies, \\nthough they are from longer letters that they wrote to us.\\n  Mollie Michel of South Philadelphia wrote to me, and I am quoting \\nher:\\n\\n       As parents, my husband and I spend a lot of time making \\n     sure our daughters are safe and healthy. We make sure they \\n     eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, do their homework, and \\n     treat each other and their peers with kindness and respect. \\n     But the one thing we cannot control is the air they breathe. \\n     For that, we rely upon our elected officials to enact the \\n     policies that protect the health and well-being of my \\n     children.\\n\\n  The only thing I would correct in Mollie's excerpt of her letter is \\nthat it is the obligation not just of elected officials but of \\nappointed officials, as well--those confirmed by the U.S. Senate, in \\nthis case, the Administrator of the EPA. Of course, it is our duty, as \\nelected officials, to make sure that we confirm people who will meet \\nthe legitimate expectations of a mom like Mollie.\\n  Patrice from Gibsonia, PA, wrote to me to say:\\n\\n       As a mom of two boys, I am deeply concerned by the track \\n     record of Acting Administrator Wheeler. He has spent his time \\n     at EPA proposing and implementing dangerous rollbacks to and \\n     attacks on pollution protections. He is putting our \\n     children's health and future at risk.\\n\\n  So said Patrice of Gibsonia.\\n  While we are on the subject of major threats to the environment, \\nmajor threats to our communities, to our children, and to our families, \\nwe cannot forget about climate change itself. Climate change is a \\nthreat to the health and well-being of our children and future \\ngenerations. We must take action to address the global climate crisis \\nwith a sense of urgency and determination. The effects of climate \\nchange are real and have become worse, and unless we take action, we \\nare going to be in a position where it will be impossible to take any \\naction if we do it too late.\\n  We can address the challenge of climate change and continue to \\nprotect jobs. We can and we must do both. One is not exclusive of the \\nother. We have already demonstrated that we can make advancements in \\nclean energy and that it can happen quickly while also benefiting the \\neconomy and creating jobs.\\n  According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and \\nBloomberg New Energy Finance, renewables--renewable sources of energy--\\nnow account for 18 percent of power generation in the United States, up \\nfrom just 9 percent in 2008.\\n  According to the 2018 U.S. Energy Employment Report, the wind and \\nsolar industries support three times as many jobs as oil and gas--three \\ntimes as many jobs as oil and gas. According to S&P Global, battery \\nstorage cost for a 20-megawatt facility declined by 40 percent in 2018. \\nSo I think it is entirely possible, and the data proves it, to deal \\nwith this crisis, to meet our obligations, to continue to create and \\ngrow jobs, and also to make sure that our economy grows as well.\\n  I live in a State where more than a generation ago we passed a State \\nConstitution provision. Article I, section 27 of the Pennsylvania \\nConstitution says in pertinent part that people have a right to clean \\nair, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural scenic, \\nhistoric, and aesthetic values of the environment. That constitutional \\nprovision goes on to say that we are trustees. We, the citizens of the \\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, are the trustees of our natural \\nresources, and they specifically talk about future generations.\\n  That is my obligation, not only as a citizen of the Commonwealth and \\nnot only as an elected official but, I believe, as an American as well.\\n  To confront these crises--whether it is attacks on clean power \\nstandards, clean air and clean water standards or whether it is the \\nchallenge of climate change itself--we need an EPA and an EPA \\nAdministrator who is totally committed to that same spirit that is set \\nforth in that State constitutional provision that the people have a \\nright to clean air and clean water, and, I would argue in a larger \\nsense, the right to the kind of creation here that is connected \\ndirectly to the question of climate change.\\n  We are talking about God's creation and preserving His creation. If \\nwe are trying to preserve God's creation, we better make sure we \\nnominate and confirm people committed to preserving creation itself. We \\nare but stewards of that creation.\\n  I yield the floor.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1307, text=\"  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \\ncommemorate two Medal of Honor recipients who passed away last month. \\nEvery Medal of Honor recipient has served his country with \\nextraordinary valor and with little or no regard for his own life and \\nsafety.\\n  Air Force Col. Joe Jackson and Army LTC Charles Kettles were no \\nexceptions. They were both pilots and both served honorably in the \\nVietnam war. Both were responsible for extraordinary rescue missions of \\nAmerican soldiers trapped deep behind enemy lines against incredible \\nodds. These two men were patriots who by chance, skill, and strength of \\ncharacter became true American heroes. They are gone now, but their \\nlegacies and examples will always live on. It is up to us to learn from \\nthem.\\n  Col. Joe Jackson passed away on January 12 at the age of 95.\\n  Jackson enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941, serving as a gunnery \\ninstructor for the duration of World War\\n\\n\\nII. But he may never have been a pilot--may never have been a hero--if \\nnot for a chance event in that war.\\n  One of his friends, a flight engineer, fell ill right before a B-25 \\nbomber flight. Jackson agreed to take his place. During the flight, one \\nof the engines caught fire. The pilot didn't know what to do, but \\nJackson did. His timely instructions helped extinguish the fire, \\npossibly saving the aircraft. Emboldened by this incident, Jackson \\ndecided to become a pilot--and he did, flying 107 missions as an F-84 \\nThunderjet pilot during the Korean war and becoming one of the very \\nfirst pilots of the U-2 spy plane.\\n  That in itself would be a pretty distinguished career of honorable \\nservice, but Joe Jackson returned for more, decades later. At the age \\nof 45 he answered the call of service once again, volunteering with the \\nAir Force's 311th Air Commando Squadron to fly cargo planes in Vietnam. \\nIt is not often a cargo pilot gets a chance to distinguish himself in \\ncombat, but it was in that very role that Joe Jackson earned the \\nNation's highest honor.\\n  May 12, 1968, was supposed to be a routine cargo mission for Joe \\nJackson and the crew of his C-123. That all changed when the American \\nspecial forces camp at Kham Duc was attacked by the North Vietnamese. \\nAs the Viet Cong overran the camp and established firing positions just \\noff the landing strip, an emergency evacuation began of the much \\nsmaller American contingent.\\n  The evacuation quickly turned into a turkey shoot. Eight aircraft and \\nhelicopters were shot down or destroyed on the runway during the \\ndesperate evacuation of Kham Duc. In a horrible tragedy, one cargo \\nplane was shot down by North Vietnamese forces shortly after takeoff. \\nAll aboard the aircraft perished--the American air crew, plus some 150 \\nSouth Vietnamese civilians. Eventually, the airlift succeeded in \\nevacuating nearly all of the camp's survivors. But as the last \\nscheduled plane left the runway and the order was given to bomb the \\nremainder of the camp, a horrible discovery was made: Three American \\nsoldiers had accidentally been left on the ground. Joe Jackson's plane \\nwas the closest to the area, so he made a split-second decision. \\n``We're going in,'' he said.\\n  The C-123 cargo plane was not known for its agility, but Joe Jackson \\ntested its limits as an aircraft. He banked the plane into a \\nbreathtaking turn and descent, dropping 9,000 feet to the runway in a \\nmatter of seconds. The plane instantly drew fire from the enemy, \\nincluding an anti-armor rocket that crashed just shy of the aircraft \\nbut, providentially, did not detonate. The three beleaguered soldiers \\nboarded Joe Jackson's aircraft, and he gunned it, lifting them to \\nsafety.\\n  That terrible assault on Kham Duc exacted a high toll in American \\nlives. But thanks to Joe Jackson's quick wits and skillful flying, that \\ntoll was much lower.\\n  Joe Jackson remained in the Air Force until 1974, when he retired as \\na full colonel. He taught at the Air Force Air War College so that \\nfuture pilots could learn from his example. Then he worked for Boeing, \\nhelping that great company build airplanes for use in peacetime, not \\njust wartime. He ultimately settled in Kent, WA, with Rosamund, his \\nwife, to whom he was married for 74 years and with whom he had two \\nchildren.\\n  Joe Jackson was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon \\nJohnson in January of 1969. He later described the heavy burden that \\nrecipients of that honor must shoulder. He said:\\n\\n       I have to represent the thousands of Americans who have \\n     served the country. You have to make them proud of what you \\n     have done and what they have done.\\n\\n  As a former soldier and as an American, let me state that there can \\nbe no finer representative of courage under fire than Joe Jackson. May \\nhe rest in peace.\\n  LTC Charles Kettles passed away on January 21 at the age of 89.\\n  Kettles was a helicopter pilot with the Army's 176th Assault \\nHelicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, Task Force Oregon.\\n  Flying was in Kettles' blood. He was born in Ypsilanti, MI, to a \\nfather who had flown for the Canadian Royal Air Force in World War I \\nand later for the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.\\n  Kettles was drafted in 1951, which began a whirlwind of Active Duty \\ntours in Korea, Japan, and Thailand. He returned to the armed services \\nin 1963, volunteering as a pilot. That is one thing to note about \\nCharles Kettles. He was always willing to volunteer for dangerous \\nassignments. Vietnam would give him many opportunities to volunteer.\\n  On May 15, 1967, then-Major Kettles volunteered to lead a flight of \\nsix Hueys to reinforce the brigade of the 101st Airborne Division that \\nhad been ambushed by a battalion of North Vietnamese.\\n  The situation was pretty hairy. It pitted Americans against hundreds \\nof the VC, and the Americans were taking heavy fire. Worse still, they \\nwere trapped in little cover in what was called ``Chump Valley,'' so \\nnicknamed because only a chump would go there.\\n  Major Kettles and his team landed under heavy fire from the enemy. \\nOne of the aviators later recalled that the tracers were ``like rain . \\n. . coming straight out of the wood line.'' So intense was the enemy \\nfire that several Americans were killed as they approached the \\nevacuation zone. Nevertheless, Major Kettles stayed until \\nreinforcements were offloaded and wounded soldiers were brought on \\nboard.\\n  After that insertion, Major Kettles returned to the battlefield a \\nsecond time when his helicopter was raked front to back by machine-gun \\nfire. Mechanics later counted 40 holes in his Huey. Major Kettles' \\ngunner was seriously wounded in this trip, but Kettles piloted his \\naircraft, limping back to base streaming fuel.\\n  Those two flights would be a full day's work and then some for any \\naviator, but Major Kettles wasn't done yet.\\n  Later that day, with the situation in the valley growing yet more \\ndesperate, Kettles volunteered for a third time to evacuate the \\nremaining 44 soldiers. So dangerous was the situation that Kettles was \\nordered to stand down. However, he disobeyed that order.\\n  Kettles led six helicopters on a third landing as fiercely contested \\nby the enemy as the previous two. Soon the last helicopter reported all \\npersonnel were evacuated off the ground, and the helicopters evacuated \\nthe area. The all clear had been given too soon; a small group of \\nAmerican soldiers who were bravely fighting a rearguard action had been \\nleft behind.\\n  One of those soldiers later recalled the feeling when he saw the \\nhelicopters disappear over the jungle canopy: ``If it's possible for \\nyour heart to fall into your boots, that's what mine did.''\\n  There were now eight Americans stranded in Chump Valley against \\nhundreds of Viet Cong. Those are long odds even for the Screaming \\nEagles of the 101st.\\n  So for the fourth time that day--the fourth time--in a split-second \\ndecision, Kettles turned around his aircraft to land in a hot LZ. This \\ntime he returned alone with no gunship support.\\n  When he landed, a mortar exploded near the front of his aircraft, \\nblowing out his Huey's chin bubble, windshields, tail boom, and rotor. \\nHis helicopter returned with 40 holes and was 600 pounds overweight \\nbecause all eight American soldiers were onboard. They all attribute \\ntheir survival to his brave actions.\\n  Kettles was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his \\nextraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, but he wasn't immediately \\nawarded the Medal of Honor. There is one thing Charles Kettles wouldn't \\nvolunteer for--the spotlight. He accepted the Distinguished Service \\nCross and moved on with his life, retiring from the military in 1978 \\nafter another tour in Vietnam.\\n\\n  Kettles moved back to Michigan, where he taught aviation management \\nat Eastern Michigan University and worked for Chrysler Pentastar \\nAviation. He married twice and had nine children, who survive him, \\nalong with his wife Ann.\\n  That is how the Kettles' story may have ended if not for a local \\nhistorian who persuaded Congress and the Army to reopen the file. When \\nthey did, it became apparent to all that he deserved the Nation's \\nhighest honor. Charles Kettles was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2016 \\nat the young age of 86. Kettles did what he could to downplay his role \\nin saving his comrades in arms. According to him, ``The bottom line of \\nthe whole thing is simply that those 44 [soldiers] did get out of there \\nand are\\n\\n\\nnot a statistic on that wall in DC. The rest of it is rather \\nimmaterial, frankly.''\\n  Pardon me here if I disagree for once with Lieutenant Colonel \\nKettles. It was due to his bravery that those 44 soldiers returned \\nalive and back to their families. On the battlefield, valor is hardly \\nimmaterial; it is essential. Charles Kettles proved that on his four \\nvolunteer rescue flights that fateful day.\\n  May he rest in peace. May both of these great warriors rest in peace.\\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1309, text=\"  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon \\nwith mixed emotions--mixed emotions because I feel a tremendous sense \\nof gratitude but also sadness because at the end of this month, \\ntomorrow, after more than a decade of working together, my chief of \\nstaff, Maura Keefe, will leave to start a new adventure.\\n  Maura is here on the floor today with my new chief of staff, Chad \\nKreikemeier, and most of our staff here in DC are in the Gallery \\nwatching. Everyone is here because we think so much of Maura, and we \\nare so sad that she is leaving but wish her Godspeed in everything she \\ndoes. She has been an incredible asset as we worked together to improve \\nthe lives of Granite Staters.\\n  I must thank her for her service and share some of the memories from \\nthe past 10 years. In New Hampshire, where we are the home of the first \\nprimary State, public service and political engagement are part of our \\nculture. It is a culture that is epitomized by Maura and her family.\\n  Maura helped me get elected in 2008. Actually, she helped me before \\nthat--in 2002, when I didn't win the election. Despite our loss, she \\ncame back and she worked with me in 2008, and then when we won, she set \\nup the office. She had already accumulated several careers by that time \\nin political campaigns and nonprofits and in the private sector. At \\neach and every step along the way, Maura made new friendships, and she \\nblazed a trail of accomplishments. Her time with us has certainly been \\nno different.\\n  I remember right after that election, she and a small group of people \\nwere working to set up the office. She showed me the files of people \\nwho were interested in working on the staff. I was down here for \\norientation, and she and the woman who would become the deputy chief of \\nstaff spent the whole weekend--while I was running around doing fun \\nthings, they were working into the night to go through those resumes to \\nhire the best possible people to open the office.\\n  Maura's father, who served as chief of staff to New Hampshire Senator \\nTom McIntyre, whose seat I now hold, would be very proud of everything \\nshe has done and all of her accomplishments.\\n  I will never be able to thank her enough for building our wonderful \\nteam, for hiring a staff of dedicated public servants who work hard for \\nthe people of New Hampshire.\\n  Those of us who have had the pleasure to work with Maura know her \\nsense of humor. She does great birthday cards that are very funny. \\nEvery month when we do birthdays in the office, she does farewell cards \\nthat are sort of testimonials but more roasts--or equally roast and \\ntestimonial. Her sense of humanity is also what makes her special. I \\nhave certainly benefited from both of these over the last 10 years.\\n  Maura is going to be missed, not just in our offices here in \\nWashington and in New Hampshire but throughout the Senate because for \\nthe last several years, she has played an important leadership role \\namong the Democratic chiefs of staff and among the women chiefs of \\nstaff. She has made a positive difference for all of our offices, and \\nshe has made important and constructive inroads with Senate leadership \\non both sides of the aisle. Her presence will be missed by so many \\npeople in this institution.\\n  Of course she is going to be missed for forging important consensus \\non the golf course as well. Our office does a golf outing every summer, \\nand Maura is always the one who comes out on top in those golf outings. \\nShe has two holes in one, and she displays the plaques for those holes \\nin one on the wall that is between our two offices. They are a reminder \\nthat from the Capitol to the tee box and everywhere in between, Maura \\nis a fierce competitor.\\n  Over the last 10 years, there have been real historic moments. I hope \\nthose moments will be the cornerstone of Maura's memories from the \\nSenate--the passage of healthcare reform that was decades in the \\nmaking, ushering in the first bipartisan energy efficiency legislation \\nin a generation, working to put a woman on the twenty-dollar bill, \\nincreasing funding and resources to combat the opioid crisis, expanding \\ncritical investments for the Office on Violence Against Women, and so \\nmany other critical infrastructure projects, changes in New Hampshire \\nthat have meant jobs and that have improved the lives of so many of our \\ncitizens.\\n  Perhaps the most succinct description of Maura can be credited to \\nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro, for whom Maura worked as chief of staff in \\nthe 1990s. Congresswoman DeLauro once told a reporter aptly that Maura \\nis ``someone who doesn't mince words.'' I can attest to that. When I do \\nthings that she thinks are not quite what I ought to be doing, she \\ndoesn't mince words; she lets me have it.\\n  I am going to greatly miss her daily doses of wisdom and wit. Her \\nsupporting counsel has always been invaluable to me. I can't thank her \\nenough for her dedicated service.\\n  Thank you, Maura. We are all going to miss you but me, most of all.\\n  Thank you, Madam President.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1311, text=\"  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as we are considering the leadership of \\nthe Environmental Protection Agency, I think we should pause a moment \\nto recognize this administration's record on the environment--or should \\nI say the missed opportunities--and what this administration has done \\nin moving America in the wrong direction on environmental protection. \\nThis administration's record in dealing with the greatest challenge we \\nhave--global climate change--is deplorable.\\n  I had the opportunity to lead a delegation of 10 Members of the \\nSenate to the Paris climate talks in which U.S. leadership demonstrated \\nour ability to get universal consensus that climate change is real, is \\nhappening, that it is primarily caused by the activities we do here on \\nEarth, and that we can make a difference in the trajectory of climate \\nchange and the impact it will have on our lives. If we follow what \\nscience tells us, we can change the course for the better for future \\ngenerations.\\n  I saw in Paris the importance of U.S. leadership. We had been trying \\nfor a long time to get a global agreement to deal with this challenge. \\nIt wasn't until America's leadership in Paris that we were able to get \\na global consensus. In fact, every country in the world signed on to \\nthe Paris Agreement and recognized that every nation has the \\nresponsibility to respond because what happens in the environment knows \\nno state boundaries--we are all in this together.\\n  Then there was the election of Donald Trump as President of the \\nUnited States. One of his first actions was to withdraw America from \\nthe Paris climate agreement. America became the only Nation in the \\nworld not to be part of the global effort to deal with climate change.\\n  Our leadership was now going to be lost, but the Trump administration \\ndidn't stop there. They have withdrawn the powerplant rules even though \\nit was in 2007 that the Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. EPA, \\ndetermined that carbon dioxide is a dangerous air pollutant and is \\nrequired to be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under \\nthe clean air rules. Yet the administration is moving in the other \\ndirection as it relates to clean air.\\n  They did the same thing with water. The Supreme Court issued certain \\ndecisions in regard to regulated waters. It required Congress to act. \\nCongress didn't act. The administration under President Obama issued \\nregulations that were similar to what we had before the Supreme Court \\ndecision, and now the Trump administration has withdrawn those \\nregulations as they relate to clean water.\\n  The list goes on. The Trump administration is now backing down on \\nCAFE standards. That is energy efficiencies\\n\\n\\nin our automobiles. Maryland is one of 12 States under section 177 that \\nfollow California's tougher standards. That is now being jeopardized by \\nthe Trump administration.\\n  As we are considering the leadership of the Environmental Protection \\nAgency, we have to recognize that the Trump administration has moved us \\nin the wrong direction. We take pride that with every administration, \\nCongress adds to the protections we have for clean air and clean water \\nand dealing with our environment. Yet we find with this President, the \\nopposite is true. That puts special responsibility on us in Congress. \\nWe have to fill that vacuum. Yet the Republican leadership in Congress \\nhas made no effort to bring forward legislation to deal with climate \\nchange. They have not acknowledged that climate change is real. They \\nhave not acknowledged that our activities here are the primary cause of \\nclimate change. They have not acknowledged that science tells us that \\nif we do the right thing, we can affect for the better the impact of \\nclimate change in our communities. All that has been denied by this \\nadministration.\\n  What we should do is bring forward comprehensive legislation to \\nreduce greenhouse gases. We should put a true cost on carbon. Let the \\nmarket forces help solve the problems we have here. We should provide \\nfor the continued efficiency of the transportation sector. We should \\nrestore America's leadership. That is what this Congress should be \\nconsidering. Yet under Republican leadership, we have had no \\nopportunity to consider comprehensive legislation in this area.\\n  If we acted, it would be good for our environment. There is no \\nquestion about that. Why should we all be concerned about that? Let me \\ngive some examples from my State of Maryland. Over the last 50 years, \\nMaryland has experienced a 70-percent increase in rainfall. Tell the \\npeople of Ellicott City, who have experienced two 1,000-year floods in \\nthe last 20-month period. These are floods that they have never seen \\nbefore in their lifetime. A large amount of rain that fell in a very \\nshort period of time caused tremendous damage to the people of Ellicott \\nCity. Tell the 13 million people who are in danger of being displaced \\nby the end of this century because of rising sea levels. Tell the \\npeople in the Western United States whose homes were taken by \\nwildfires. We need to act. It would be good for our environment.\\n  I am proud to be one of the Senators who represent the Chesapeake Bay \\nWatershed. There are 18 million people who live in the Chesapeake Bay \\nWatershed. We see a rise in the sea level. This is a vulnerable body of \\nwater.\\n  The warming of the Chesapeake Bay is causing the loss of seagrasses \\nthat are important for the aquatic life. The salinity of the bay is \\nbeing diminished because of more freshwater, and that is affecting the \\necology of the bay. Algae growths are greater and longer because of the \\nwarm waters. All of that affects the Chesapeake Bay. If we respond to \\nclimate change, we have a much better chance of improving the quality \\nof the Chesapeake Bay, which is critically important for the way of \\nlife for the people who live in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\\n  It is also, by the way, an important economic issue. If we do what is \\nright and respond to climate change, we will also be helping our \\neconomy. The Chesapeake Bay alone adds $1 trillion to our economy. A \\nclean bay helps our economy. Green energy creates jobs--many more jobs \\nthan do traditional fossil fuels.\\n  It also is good for our national security. If we use more of the \\nrenewables and fewer fossil, we as a nation will be stronger from the \\npoint of view of not being dependent on other countries that don't \\nagree with our way of life for supplying energy needs not only to us \\nbut to our allies around the world--to the democratic countries around \\nthe world. It makes sense.\\n  As we are considering the future leadership of the Environmental \\nProtection Agency, let us recommit ourselves to recognizing that we \\nhave responsibilities to advance these environmental issues and implore \\nupon the Republican leadership to bring forward comprehensive \\nlegislation that, in fact, will make a significant difference on the \\ntrajectory of climate change here in the United States and will restore \\nAmerica's global leadership on this critically important issue.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1313, text=\"  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I start by associating myself with the \\nremarks of my friend, the senior Senator from the State of Maryland, \\nMr. Cardin, both with respect to the vital importance of moving forward \\non climate change legislation here in the Senate and with respect to my \\nopposition to the nomination of Mr. Wheeler. I think we need somebody \\nat the head of the EPA who is going to make the issue of climate change \\nand other vital environmental issues a priority.\\n\\n\\n                   Declaration of National Emergency\\n\\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor with respect to another critical \\nissue facing this Senate right now. I would just start by noting the \\nfact that earlier this week, in this very Chamber, the senior Senator \\nfrom Nebraska, Mrs. Deb Fischer, gave the annual reading of George \\nWashington's Farewell Address, reminding all of us of the advice that \\nour first President gave our country upon his resignation. He \\nencouraged us to review the words of his farewell address frequently as \\nthe ``disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have \\nno personal motive to bias his counsel.'' Those were the words of \\nGeorge Washington in his farewell address as he gave us all some \\nwarnings and admonitions.\\n  Maryland is particularly proud of the fact that President Washington \\nresigned his military commission in Annapolis, in our Old Senate \\nChamber. Every year, in the Maryland Senate, where I once served, we \\nhonor President Washington for Presidents Day. One year, I had the \\nhonor of giving the commemorative address on that occasion, and I \\nappreciate the fact that the U.S. Senate recognizes the extraordinary \\nfarewell address delivered by our first President. His words of warning \\nhave been prescient throughout history, from his caution against \\ninternal divisions, including geographic divisions between the North \\nand the South, to the necessity of avoiding foreign entanglements that \\nwould imperil our own unity.\\n  At this particular moment in time, as we reflect on President \\nWashington's Farewell Address, we have to do it in the context of the \\ncurrent President's extraordinary, unnecessary, and, I believe, totally \\nunlawful declaration of emergency powers for the sole purpose of \\ndiverting taxpayer money, which has been previously appropriated by \\nthis Congress, to a different purpose, especially to build a wall along \\nour southern border. In that context, we really need to reflect on the \\nwords of our first President and remember that our Constitution \\nentrusts us, through article I, as a coequal branch of government, to \\ndo our duty under the Constitution.\\n  We know the history. We know that after winning our independence from \\nEngland, President Washington, along with many of our other Founders, \\nwas concerned with the possibility of authoritarianism and of the \\ncritical need to build checks and balances into our political system. \\nHere is the key warning in the farewell address on this score: ``The \\nhabits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those \\nentrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their \\nrespective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the \\npowers of one department to encroach upon another.''\\n  President Washington argued that this encroachment of one branch of \\ngovernment on the constitutional powers of another is a natural impulse \\nand one that we must guard against as a self-governing people because \\nof the ``love of power and proneness to abuse it,'' and that is why \\nchecks and balances are necessary to prevent it.\\n  He went on to write:\\n\\n       The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of \\n     political power, by dividing and distributing it into \\n     different depositaries and constituting each the guardian of \\n     the public weal against invasions by the others, has been \\n     evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in \\n     our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be \\n     as necessary as to institute them.\\n\\n  Now let's review what just happened here in our political system in \\nthe last couple of weeks. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump, after \\nfailing to achieve his desired outcome through the legislative process, \\nthrough congressional action, decided that he would bypass the Congress \\nby declaring\\n\\n\\na national emergency in order to redirect funding to build the wall. \\nThis is a textbook example of the kind of power grab by an executive \\nbranch that George Washington warned us about in his farewell address.\\n  President Trump is claiming he has this authority pursuant to the \\nNational Emergencies Act of 1976, but a review of the legislative \\nhistory of the National Emergencies Act demonstrates that it was passed \\nnot to expand Presidential power but to curb it. Three years earlier, \\nCongress's Special Committee on the Termination of the National \\nEmergency was created to end outdated emergency declarations and, \\naccording to the committee's report at the time, ``recommend ways in \\nwhich the United States can meet future emergency situations with speed \\nand effectiveness but without relinquishment of congressional oversight \\nand control.'' That was what the special committee's report concluded, \\nand that formed the basis of the legislation that followed.\\n  The National Emergencies Act gives the President very, very narrow \\nand conditioned-based authority to declare an emergency and specify the \\nsteps necessary to confront it, and it gives Congress the authority, as \\nwe saw in the House just yesterday, to pass legislation to disapprove \\nof and to terminate the emergency. Of course, it will also be subject \\nto court review. I would suggest that it is not our job to pass laws \\nwhich we know to be unconstitutional and simply leave it to the courts \\nto reach the obvious conclusions. We have a responsibility here in this \\nChamber, not only under the Constitution but under the very statute the \\nPresident proposes to use now for his declaration, to apply our \\nauthority and responsibility as a coequal branch of government.\\n\\n  Now let's review the context of this decision. The President's \\ninterest in spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money for a wall \\nalong the southern border was not a secret to Congress. Of course, \\nduring the campaign--as a matter of his campaign pledges and as he \\ncontinues to insist--he did say that at the end of the day, Mexico will \\npay for it. Yet, for the purposes of today, that is not the main point. \\nThe point is that the President had told this Congress that it was his \\nintention to try to spend billions of dollars to build a wall.\\n  His original budget request to the Congress for the fiscal year that \\nwe are in was $1.6 billion. That was the budget request we got from the \\nSenate Appropriations Committee. Then, last fall and last winter, in \\nDecember, the President began demanding much higher amounts for the \\nwall he wants to build. In fact, in his meeting with then-Democratic \\nLeader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Leader Schumer on December 11, here \\nis what the President said: If we don't get what we want, one way or \\nthe other, through you or the military or anybody else, yes, I will \\nshut down the government.\\n  That was in December. What the President was saying was that if he \\ndoesn't get his appropriations--the budget request--through the \\nCongress, he was going to shut down the government. He did, and he did \\nthat for 35 days. That was his constitutional prerogative not to sign a \\nbill. It, obviously, caused great harm and dislocation around the \\ncountry. It caused a lot of economic pain and a lot of personal \\nfinancial pain to millions of Americans, but the President clearly had \\nthe authority to do that.\\n  As the Congress, we were aware of the President's position. He made \\nit very clear. Then, after the government shutdown was over, of course, \\nwe passed that short-term piece of legislation to keep the government \\nopen for 3 weeks as we worked on a longer term budget plan.\\n  Around February 14 of this year, we passed a compromise budget bill--\\na compromise appropriations bill. That bill provided $1.375 billion for \\n55 miles of pedestrian and levee fencing along the U.S. border with \\nMexico. That bill passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 83 to 16, and it \\npassed the House of Representatives by a vote of 300 to 128. As with \\nmost bills that pass the Congress with those kinds of bipartisan \\nmajorities that are compromises, it didn't have everything everyone \\nwanted. It had some things in it that one side or the other may not \\nhave wanted, but it was a compromise, and it was made necessary to pass \\na bill to keep the government open. It was to make sure our \\nconstituents received the services of their government and to make sure \\nthat we met the needs of the country.\\n  On the very morning that we considered that bill here in the Senate \\nChamber, President Trump was considering his next steps. In fact, \\nMajority Leader McConnell announced on the floor here that President \\nTrump had told him that he was going to sign the bill but that he was \\nalso going to sign an emergency declaration to override the \\nappropriations in the bill and divert those moneys to some other \\npurpose that Congress had not authorized. In fact, while Senator \\nMcConnell was making that statement at the time we were considering and \\nvoting on the bill, it was not a surprise that the President had been \\nconsidering it. He had been talking for weeks and threatening the \\nCongress that if he didn't get the appropriations levels he wanted for \\nthe wall--if he didn't get the budget allocation he wanted--he was just \\ngoing to declare a national emergency and do it himself. That was his \\nthreat.\\n  Clearly, he hoped that threat would force Congress to provide the \\nextra moneys the President requested for the wall, but the Congress \\ndidn't do the President's bidding. We passed that compromise bill by \\nthose large bipartisan majorities. So what did the President do? Of \\ncourse, he declared this emergency.\\n  I should note that even as he announced his emergency declaration in \\nthe Rose Garden, the President said: ``I could do the wall over a \\nlonger period of time. I didn't need to do this . . . but I'd rather do \\nit much faster.'' That is what the President said at the time. He said \\nhe didn't need to do this, not in that way, but he wanted to do this \\nquickly.\\n  Here is the thing. He didn't need to do it. He made it very clear \\nthat he decided to do it simply because he didn't get what he wanted \\nfrom the U.S. Congress; that because we didn't do what the President--\\nwhat the Executive asked, heck, he was going to declare some emergency \\nto divert money from areas the Congress had approved on a bipartisan \\nbasis to some other area the President wanted to spend money on, in \\nthis case the wall.\\n  Now, look, the Constitution is pretty clear. The President had the \\npower to veto that bill. He, of course, had refused to go along with an \\nearlier proposal, and that led to a 3-week government shutdown. The \\nPresident could have done that again. That would have been in his power \\nto do it, and of course the choice for the Congress at that point would \\nhave been whether to override the President's veto.\\n  If you look at the size of the votes that appropriations bill passed \\nby--83 to 16 in the U.S. Senate and 300 to 128 in the House--he could \\nhave overridden the veto. That would have been the constitutional way \\nfor the President of the United States to try to get his way, but that \\nis not what he did. He decided to do something different, declare an \\nemergency in an unconstitutional way.\\n  The question we have to ask ourselves--and I am talking Republicans \\nand Democrats, and I am talking about the Senate as an institution, the \\nHouse of Representatives as an institution--is should this President or \\nany other President--or any other President--be able to override an \\nappropriations law to the tune of billions of dollars right after \\nCongress has already expressed its position in a bill that we passed by \\noverwhelming majorities or by any majority, a bill that passed.\\n  In declaring this alleged emergency, the President has announced his \\nintention to divert $2.6 billion from the Department of Defense \\ncounterdrug activities. This is an ironic diversion, considering the \\nPresident's stated concern, which I share, about drug trafficking.\\n  The Defense Department has indicated that those moneys the President \\nis proposing to take from drug trafficking are being spent for that \\npurpose and that only about $85 million remains in that account. So \\nthat means they are going to have to take other moneys from other \\nDefense Department priorities, and the President has indicated they \\nwant to take $3.6 billion from military construction accounts--moneys \\nthat this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has already appropriated for \\nthose military construction projects.\\n  Article I is crystal clear. Article I of the Constitution vests this \\nCongress--\\n\\n\\nthis Senate and the House of Representatives--with the power of the \\npurse.\\n  I have my handy, small Constitution right here, and I would just \\nagain like to remind our colleagues that it says: ``No money shall be \\ndrawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by \\nLaw, and a regular statement and account of the receipts and \\nexpenditures of all public money shall be published from time to \\ntime.''\\n  So article I of the Constitution is very clear. It is the U.S. \\nCongress that has the power of the purse and has the authority to \\ndirect taxpayer moneys to the priorities that we decide.\\n  I ask my colleagues whether they are prepared to relinquish that \\nauthority. In fact, I would make the point it is really not ours to \\nrelinquish because the Constitution is quite clear on this point.\\n  We all know that yesterday the House of Representatives took a vote \\nto say the President is not able to use the particular law he used the \\nother day to declare an emergency. This Senate is going to be voting on \\nthat soon, and we have to ask ourselves as Senators what kind of \\nprecedent we want to set.\\n  Do we want to adhere to our duties under the Constitution? Should any \\nPresident be able to say, ``Oh, my goodness. I don't like what the \\nCongress just did. I don't like the fact that the Congress, through \\ntheir duly elected Representatives and duly elected Senators, didn't \\ngive me all the money I wanted for the wall, and so I am going to throw \\nthe Constitution out, and I am going to take money that the Congress \\nproposed for one purpose, and I am just going to move it somewhere \\nelse''?\\n\\n  I want my colleagues to think really carefully about the precedent we \\nwould be establishing if we allow that action to go unchecked.\\n  We were just having a conversation here on the floor, my colleague \\nfrom the State of Maryland and others, about the dangers and risks of \\nclimate change. That is a real crisis. I believe we should be investing \\na lot more funds in building out our clean energy infrastructure.\\n  We may well have a future President, maybe sooner rather than later, \\nwho wants to do that. I just ask my colleagues whether they think that \\nPresident should be able to declare a national emergency and spend \\nmoney for that purpose even if this Congress has not appropriated the \\nmoneys for that purpose.\\n  The idea that the President of the United States--any President of \\nthe United States--is going to declare an emergency simply because he \\nor she did not get the appropriations request they asked for is \\nunprecedented. We have looked. There have been times when people have \\ndeclared emergencies, but we were not able to find any time where we \\nhave a situation like this, where a President, who tried to get a \\ncertain appropriation for a certain purpose out of Congress, didn't get \\nit and immediately turned around and asked for a national emergency to \\ndo what the Congress had just denied them the authority to do.\\n  Just this morning President Trump's adviser, Kellyanne Conway, was on \\n``FOX & Friends'' and said the President had to act because Congress \\ndidn't. In other words, the President had to act because Congress, on a \\nbipartisan basis, through its duly elected representatives, did not \\ngive the President of the United States, the Executive, what the \\nExecutive asked for. That is why the President gets to declare an \\nemergency.\\n  That would create a lawless situation and a gross violation of our \\nConstitution.\\n  She went on to say: ``It's failed to do its job since he has been \\nPresident on securing the border, and it has failed to do its job for \\ndecades, and so he waited for them.'' In other words, because the \\nPresident is dissatisfied with what the Congress did, he gets to tear \\nup the Constitution and go his own way.\\n  Back in 1983, when President Reagan was frustrated with the Congress \\nand its control of the budget, he received a letter urging him to \\ndeclare a state of emergency over our Nation's finances. In response, \\nPresident Reagan acknowledged his frustration but wrote: ``I don't \\nbelieve the President has the power to declare an emergency short of \\nwar.''\\n  I urge my colleagues--I urge my colleagues--to be cautious in \\nallowing any President to use or claim an emergency in order to \\nundercut the clear division of power set forth in the Constitution \\nbetween the legislative and the executive branch.\\n  Yesterday Leader McConnell was asked about the legality of President \\nTrump's move, and the majority leader acknowledged he ``hadn't reached \\na total conclusion'' on whether President Trump is acting legally.\\n  Think about that. You have the majority leader acknowledging that the \\nPresident may be acting unlawfully. I think it is pretty clear on its \\nface for those who closely examine the Constitution and the power of \\nthe purse.\\n  I think we are all called upon not as Republicans or Democrats but as \\nAmericans and as Senators in this Chamber to do our job and reject what \\nis clearly an unconstitutional power grab. We should not passively \\nsubmit to these actions. We should think about what we are going to do \\nin light of the precedent that is being set here, and I hope we will do \\nour jobs.\\n  I will just close with another statement from President Washington's \\nFarewell Address where he cautioned against allowing any one branch of \\ngovernment to claim excessive power, even with the best of motivations. \\n``Let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one \\ninstance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by \\nwhich free governments are destroyed.''\\n  In my view, the President's actions are not for the good, but I know \\nmany of my Republican colleagues would agree with the ends the \\nPresident seeks with respect to using more moneys to build a wall. I \\nunderstand that is the position of our Republican colleagues, but what \\nGeorge Washington warned us about was--whether we like what the \\nPresident is doing or don't like what the President is doing--if the \\nPresident is diverting money away from the purposes this Senate and the \\nHouse of Representatives directed to some other purpose this President \\nor any other President may want that we have not authorized, that is a \\ngross usurpation of power, and we should not allow it to happen.\\n  So I ask my colleagues, let's join together to do the business of the \\nSenate, protect the Constitution, and do our jobs.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1315, text=\"  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I would associate myself with the comments \\nof Senator Van Hollen, who I think hit the nail on the head when it \\ncomes to this overreach by the President.\\n  I rise in support of the growing calls for action on climate change \\nthat are echoing in every corner of this Nation.\\n  The science is overwhelming, the evidence is clear, and unless we \\ntake immediate action, we will lose our planet as we know it. There is \\nnowhere that has more at stake than my home State of New Mexico and the \\nSouthwest, which are in the bullseye of global warming. Unless we act \\nagainst greenhouse gas pollution, rising temperatures, drought, \\nwildfires, deforestation, we will permanently harm our communities.\\n  Because I believe in climate science and because I believe we \\ndesperately need to act, I must strongly oppose the confirmation of \\nAndrew Wheeler to lead our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency. \\nMr. Wheeler has consistently advocated for measures that would damage \\nthe environment, hurt public health, and do long-term injury to the \\neconomy, and his record on climate change and the record of his \\nadministration are simply disqualifying.\\n  Mr. Wheeler's nomination is among the worst in a long line of \\nbackward nominations by this President. For someone who wants to lead \\nthe EPA--the key word being ``protection''--Mr. Wheeler's priorities \\nare upside down.\\n  Let's be blunt with the American people. Mr. Wheeler was not \\nnominated to protect the environment and human health. He was nominated \\nto unravel and undo the environmental protections that are now in \\nplace. He was nominated to stop any new environmental and public health \\nprotections from being initiated. He was nominated to go easy on those \\nwho violate existing environmental laws. He was nominated to stand in \\nthe way of climate science and climate action.\\n\\n\\n  So far, by these measures, he has been a great success for a \\nPresident who mocks climate science and who denies that this \\nexistential threat even exists, but there is no success for the \\nAmerican people. Mr. Wheeler's nomination puts the American public at \\ngreat risk, and we should firmly oppose making his appointment \\npermanent.\\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler's upside-down priorities don't end at \\nclimate change. In addition to actively resisting climate action, Mr. \\nWheeler is not looking out for the health and well-being of my \\nconstituents or protecting my State's most precious resource, our \\nwater. There, like in so many other parts of the country, fire foam \\nused by the Air Force has contaminated groundwater with toxic chemicals \\nknown as PFAS. These chemicals are linked to various cancers, heart \\ndisease, and other ailments. Groundwater in and around Cannon Air Force \\nBase, near Clovis, NM, is contaminated with PFAS.\\n  This is dairy country. One dairy is actually being put out of \\nbusiness because the PFAS is in groundwater and it has contaminated \\nthis farmer's water wells. The family that owns the dairy and its hard-\\nworking employees have drank water from these wells for years.\\n  Will a Wheeler EPA put us in this situation? Will they help us out of \\nit? During his confirmation hearings, he refused to commit to setting a \\ndrinking water standard. Then, later, we find out that he had already \\ndecided not to set standards for these toxic chemicals in December of \\nlast year. Under bipartisan pressure, he has since backed down and says \\nEPA will set a standard--someday. I wouldn't hold my breath. In the \\nmeantime, millions of Americans and the dairies in eastern New Mexico \\nare being hurt.\\n  Furthermore, Mr. Wheeler is a committed soldier in the long-running \\nassault on science that President Trump has championed. One of my \\nconstituents, Celerah Hewes, wrote this week asking me to vote against \\nthis nomination. She writes:\\n\\n       I grew up in Corrales, surrounded by farmland and fresh \\n     air. I remember when the Rio Grande was full of water and the \\n     ditches in the bosque flowed freely.\\n       Climate change and drought have forever changed the land I \\n     call home and my daughter will not remember a time without \\n     severe fire danger and ozone pollution.\\n\\n  Celerah wants me to vote no because Mr. Wheeler ``is putting our \\nchildren's health and future at risk.''\\n  According to the 2018 ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' we have \\n12 years to turn this around for Celerah, her daughter, and the world. \\nSoon, the impacts will become irreversible.\\n  The previous EPA set rules to reduce carbon pollution from \\npowerplants by 32 percent by 2030. Mr. Wheeler's new plan will allow \\nincreased emissions from fossil fuel plants instead.\\n  He is no better when it comes to even modest standards for methane \\nwaste from oil and gas operations. Methane is an extremely potent \\ngreenhouse gas, 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the \\ninitial 20-year period. EPA's prior methane rules would have cut back \\nmethane pollution in a cost-effective way. Those regulations are out \\nthe window under Mr. Wheeler and replaced with loose rules, adding \\nhundreds of thousands of tons of methane, volatile organic compounds, \\nand toxins into the air.\\n  Climate change is the most significant threat facing our planet. The \\nEPA is the Agency that should be leading the charge on tackling this \\nthreat, but Mr. Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the coal industry. \\nLike so many other nominations, the President has again put the fox in \\ncharge of the henhouse. This time, the consequences could be disastrous \\nand irreversible for our country and our planet. If we vote to confirm \\nhim, there will be little, if any, hope for climate action for the next \\n2 years.\\n  Mr. Wheeler leaves no doubt whose side he is on. His record shows \\nthat, under his watch, big polluters will get off scot-free.\\n  Companies that pollute often try to reduce their cost of business and \\nincrease their profits by dumping that pollution and its costs on \\nsociety as a whole. When environmental officials fail to enforce the \\nrules against polluters, bad actors get an unfair advantage. Lax \\nenvironmental enforcement is bad for American businesses that do the \\nright thing and bad for taxpayers, who get stuck with the cleanup \\nbills.\\n  Sadly, Mr. Wheeler's EPA is the poster child for lax enforcement. In \\n2018, EPA collected the smallest amount of civil penalties against \\npolluters since 1994. Inspections are half of what they were in 2010. \\nEPA charged the fewest criminal defendants since 1991. It saw a steep \\ndrop in civil judicial enforcement cases as well. The bad news goes on \\nand on.\\n  So the best that can be said of Mr. Wheeler's record is that he is \\nnot Scott Pruitt. As far as we know, he has not abused taxpayer funds \\nor staff for a variety of luxurious perks or rented his house from a \\nlobbyist. But the bar is so low that it is in the Capitol basement.\\n  Indeed, I believe that the EPA under this President has reached an \\nall-time low. There is hardly even any pretense that their goal is to \\nsafeguard the environment and public health. They are actively damaging \\nour environment and actively resisting action on climate change at a \\ntime when young people and so many others across New Mexico and this \\ncountry are crying out for action. We simply must do better.\\n  So I will vote no, and I will urge my colleagues to consider the \\nconsequences of this nomination for their children, grandchildren, and \\nbeyond, and to vote no as well.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=1366, text=\"  Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill to \\nrestore the partnership between the federal government and counties for \\nthe health care costs of inmates who have not been convicted of a \\ncrime. This legislation will provide some relief to our nation's local \\neconomies, while strengthening the fundamental principles of our \\njustice system.\\n  In almost all states, a person who is incarcerated in a county jail \\nor juvenile detention facility loses their Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP or \\nSSI benefits even if they have not been convicted of a crime. The U.S. \\nSupreme Court's interpretation of the 8th Amendment requires government \\nentities to provide medical care to all inmates. As a result, local \\ngovernments are burdened with the expense of providing health care to \\nthousands of men, women, and children currently awaiting trial.\\n  Providing health care for inmates constitutes a major portion of \\nlocal jail operating costs. Requiring county governments to cover \\nhealth care costs for inmates who have not yet been convicted of a \\ncrime places an unnecessary\\n\\n\\nburden on local governments, which have their fair share of widespread \\nbudget deficits and cuts to safety net programs and other essential \\nservices to deal with as it is.\\n  Terminating benefits to inmates who are awaiting trial undermines the \\npresumption of innocence, which is a cornerstone principle of our \\njustice system. The current practice does not distinguish between \\npersons who are awaiting disposition of charges and persons who have \\nbeen duly convicted and sentenced. Moreover, this reality \\ndisproportionately affects low-income and minority populations who are \\noften unable to post bond, which would enable them to continue \\nreceiving benefits.\\n  Madam Speaker, my legislation addresses this problem by prohibiting \\nthe federal government from stripping individuals of their Medicare, \\nMedicaid, and SSI benefits before the inmate has been convicted of a \\ncrime. It preserves the partnership between the federal and local \\ngovernments and ensures that local governments are not burdened with an \\nunfair share of meeting the constitutional mandate to guarantee medical \\ncoverage. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this \\ncommonsense bill that addresses a problem affecting communities all \\nacross the nation.\\n\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care'})\n",

Today, it is my \\ndistinct pleasure to name Magellan Transport Logistics, of \\nJacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.\\n  Founded in 2006, Magellan Transport Logistics is a Service-Disabled \\nVeteran-Owned Small Business dedicated to providing its customers with \\na wide range of transportation needs. Tom Piatak founded Magellan \\nTransport Logistics based on many of the same qualities that he learned \\nwhile serving in the U.S. Army. A graduate of the U.S. Military \\nAcademy, Tom instills into the company the values he learned from West \\nPoint, as well as from his service as a combat engineer during \\nOperation Desert Storm.\\n  Today, Tom serves as chief executive officer and chairman of \\nMagellan. Under his guidance, the company has quickly become a leader \\nin supporting the vast transportation needs of its clients. Tom and his \\nteam have gained much of their success by recruiting some of the most \\ntalented leaders and logistics professionals in the industry. By \\ninstituting four core values of entrepreneurship, ownership mentality, \\ninnovation, and transparency within the company, Magellan has created a \\npositive culture that has translated into rapid growth and success. In \\nMarch of 2018, Magellan announced the acquisition of a 47,000-square-\\nfoot warehouse and the hiring of 100 employees over the next 5 years, \\nfurthering its investment in the Jacksonville community.\\n  Magellan is known for its dedication to its employees and as a pillar \\nof the Jacksonville community. The company offers complete logistics \\nand transportation services, both local and international, by truck or \\nairplane, while also providing warehousing services and supply chain \\nmanagement. Magellan has built strong relationships with its clients by \\nembracing the ``no man left behind'' principle that Tom learned during \\nhis time serving our country in the U.S. Army.\\n  As a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Magellan is \\ncommitted to hiring veterans and participating in community service \\nevents to benefit America's veterans. This past December, Magellan \\nsponsored 20 wreaths for National Wreaths Across America Day, as well \\nas assisted with unloading and placing the memorial wreaths on the \\ngraves of fallen servicemembers. Magellan actively supports the Wounded \\nWarrior Project, and their commitment to veterans in their community is \\na testament to the company's values.\\n  In addition to their continued service to our Nation's veterans, \\nMagellan has also aided the community in disaster relief efforts. \\nFollowing Hurricane Michael in the fall of 2018, Magellan\\n\\n\\nworked directly with FEMA, providing 40 trucks and three staff members \\nas part of the disaster recovery effort. They also partnered with \\nOperation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit organization, to deliver meals and \\nsupplies to families throughout impacted areas.\\n  Tom Piatak and Magellan are regularly honored for their success and \\ndedication to the Jacksonville community. During the 2017-2018 NFL \\nfootball season, the Jacksonville Jaguars honored Magellan as their \\nVeteran Business Owner of the Week. The Jacksonville Business Journal \\nrecognized Tom and the team at Magellan for their efforts to hire \\nveterans, and the Wounded Warrior Project awarded the company with the \\nWounded Warrior Certificate of Recognition in 2017.\\n  Tom Piatak's work to grow Magellan Transport Logistics while staying \\ncommitted to his community and veterans represents the dedication to \\nservice for which Florida entrepreneurs are well known. Through hard \\nwork, Tom and his team at Magellan Transport Logistics have built a \\nsuccessful business grounded in strong values, while serving as an \\nexample of superior corporate citizenship.

      "Pandas(Index=1396, text=\"  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to lead a Special \\nOrder alongside my colleagues to discuss, frankly, a reckless and \\nmisguided and radical proposal recently introduced by some of my \\nDemocratic colleagues, the Green New Deal.\\n  Tonight, together with many of my fellow members of the Congressional \\nWestern Caucus, we will be taking the time to share with the American \\npeople the details of the ill-advised and bizarre provisions included \\nin this green manifesto and the grave impacts that they would have on \\nour Nation's economy.\\n\\n\\n  We will also share what we, as Republicans in the people's House, \\nbelieve when it comes to our national strategy to innovate, diversify, \\nand strengthen America's energy sector.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal is a bad deal for the American \\npeople. This so-called deal calls for cutting of greenhouse gas \\nemissions to net zero in only 10 years.\\n  And while many studies are still working to grasp the perilous \\nimpacts and the enormous costs of this proposal, one independent \\nestimate, led by a team of Stanford engineers, suggests it would cost \\nour Nation in the neighborhood of $7 trillion to convert all of \\nAmerica's power to renewable power sources.\\n\\n\\n  To quote the former Secretary of Energy under President Obama, Ernest \\nMoniz, he said: ``I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go \\nto zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It is just impractical.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal goes much further than just the \\nenergy sector, however. It also mandates the guarantee of a job for \\neveryone, paid vacations for everyone, free college for everyone. It \\ndictates that every existing building in this country must be upgraded \\nand retrofitted for ``comfort.''\\n  It calls for a drastic overhaul of our transportation systems across \\nthe country, threatening not only our trucking and airline industries, \\nbut also the daily lives of the 85 percent of Americans who drive every \\nmorning or evening to get to work.\\n  Mr. Speaker, while calling for all of these implausible mandates, the \\nGreen New Deal would also insert the Federal Government into seemingly \\nevery aspect of our daily lives.\\n  By expanding our Federal bureaucracy far beyond anything we have ever \\nseen in history and undermining the federalist principles our country \\nwas founded upon in the Constitution, this proposal would jeopardize \\nthe future of America as we know it. It would sacrifice the American \\nenergy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors; jeopardize \\nbusinesses small and large across the Nation; and lead our country down \\nthe path of socialist nations like Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba.\\n  As the Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said after reading the \\nproposal: ``What in the heck is this?''\\n  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more.\\n  My State, the great State of Washington, consistently ranks among the \\ntop of the list of States with the cleanest energy production. Do you \\nknow why that is? It is because of the strong reliance on our \\nincredible system of hydroelectric dams, many of which are in my \\ncongressional district along the Columbia and the Snake Rivers.\\n  Nearly 70 percent of our power comes from hydropower, a clean, \\nrenewable, reliable, and affordable source of baseload energy.\\n  It also comes from our use of nuclear power. The Columbia Generating \\nStation, which is also in the Fourth Congressional District which I \\nrepresent, is the only nuclear power plant in the greater Northwest \\nregion. It too provides clean, reliable power for the Pacific \\nNorthwest.\\n  On top of these sources, Washington State uses a variety of other \\nenergy sources, including natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and biomass.\\n  It is because we use an all-of-the-above mix of energy sources, but \\nlargely concentrated on clean, renewable, reliable hydropower, that \\nWashington State continues to demonstrate how we can lead in the use of \\nclean energy while still diversifying and thereby strengthening our \\nenergy portfolio.\\n  Unfortunately, the Green New Deal negates this ability to do so. Not \\nonce is the word ``hydropower'' mentioned in the legislation. And in \\nthe frequently asked questions document that was released to accompany \\nthe introduction of the Green New Deal, it stated that ``The plan is to \\ntransition off of nuclear.''\\n  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to continue to strengthen America's \\nenergy independence and increase our use of clean sources of energy, we \\nmust absolutely include hydropower and nuclear power. The science says \\nso, the facts say so.\\n  So when Democrats in Congress release a sweeping, colossal overhaul \\nof our Nation's energy policies and do not include these clean energy \\nsources, it is clear that this is far more about politics and not about \\nsound science.\\n  Mr. Speaker, my fellow House Republicans and I continue to advocate \\nfor sound, comprehensive approaches to energy policy. We must continue \\nto explore every opportunity to develop viable alternative energy \\nsources, which is why under Republican control of the House in recent \\nCongresses, we have made serious investments in advanced nuclear and \\nbasic science research, grid-scale energy storage, and equipped our \\nnational laboratories with robust resources to lead the way in \\nresearch, development, and innovation.\\n  National laboratories, like the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory \\nin my district, play a crucial role in developing the basic science \\nresearch needed to pave the way for these alternative sources. Then \\nwhen private industry can utilize this research, the open marketplace \\ncan put these new sources to use.\\n  That is exactly what our country needs: more collaboration, more \\ninnovation; not a top-down mandated system of bureaucratic dictates \\nbased upon a green manifesto.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I often share with my constituents that as a third \\ngeneration farmer, I consider myself to be a conservationist and on the \\nfront lines of being a good steward of our natural resources. I know \\nthat we must respect our environment, we must ensure clean air and \\nclean water for our citizens, and we must encourage innovative ways to \\nproduce energy through a variety of reliable, renewable traditional and \\nalternative sources.\\n  Tonight I am looking forward to hearing from my friends and my \\ncolleagues in the Congressional Western Caucus on why the Green New \\nDeal would be catastrophic for their constituents and what we in our \\nNation's capital should really be prioritizing in order to continue \\nAmerica's energy independence dominance.\\n\\n  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my first speaker, the gentleman \\nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the gentleman that represents the Eighth \\nDistrict of that great State.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Education'})\n",

Fracking, demonized by environmental extremists \\nwithout justification, has proven to be the best energy solution for \\nour environment.\\n  Abundant oil and natural gas has reduced electricity bills, kept gas \\nprices low, and provided the largest share of U.S. electric power \\ngeneration in recent years.\\n  The oil and gas industry supports more than 10.3 million jobs and \\nnearly 8 percent of our economy.\\n  The United States is the world's top energy producer, and the \\nAmerican Dream is thriving.\\n  January 2019 saw the hundredth consecutive month of positive jobs \\ngrowth in America, the longest period of continuous jobs growth on \\nrecord.\\n  The U.S. job market is strong, and in December, employers posted 7.3 \\nmillion open jobs, a new record.\\n  Now, despite America's energy renaissance and the aforementioned \\nemissions reductions, we continue to hear hyperbolic statements about \\npending climate catastrophe and the need for radical change to stave \\noff future disaster.\\n  The Democrat socialists pushing the Green New Deal want to get rid of \\nall energy sources except wind, solar, and batteries by 2030. How are \\nwe going to do that when wind and solar only produced 7.6 percent of \\nour electricity in 2017?\\n  The Green New Deal would drive energy production and jobs to \\ncountries like China and India that have much worse environmental \\nstandards. Global greenhouse gas emissions will increase as a result, \\nin direct contradiction to the main talking point of the Green New \\nDeal.\\n  The socialist Green New Deal says it will provide higher education, \\nhigher quality healthcare, and affordable, safe, and adequate housing \\nto all.\\n\\n\\n  The Mercatus Center estimates that the cost of the single-payer \\nhealthcare provision alone would cost $32 trillion in the first 10 \\nyears, something that I think is probably on the low side.\\n  The Green New Deal is an alarmist pipe dream that seeks to \\nfundamentally transform America without a blueprint. This socialist \\nmanifesto changes by the day, and important details on how a transition \\nof the Green New Deal's magnitude will occur are missing, including how \\nwe will pay for this pie in the sky aspiration.\\n  If one needs to have more evidence that the Green New Deal is not \\nplausible, look no further than the country of Australia where \\nelectricity prices are the highest in the world and the Aussies' \\nobsession with renewables has destroyed their electric grid.

This is so broad and \\nexpansive, as Mr. Newhouse has said, it will, basically, invade every \\naspect of every American's life, and it will cost tens of trillions of \\ndollars to implement.\\n  How will we pay for that? We are going to pay for that with crushing \\nnew taxes on individuals, families, and companies. We are going to \\ndestroy the current foundation of our entire American economy.\\n  There will be more borrowing, not just from the public sector, but \\nfrom the private sector. The public sector is in trouble because the \\nFederal Government just hit $22 trillion of national debt.\\n  The question is, what will the impact of this be on the environment? \\nIt would do little to solve the alleged problem of carbon in the \\natmosphere because the United States is no longer the primary source of \\ncarbon emissions.\\n  Between 2005 and 2017, our Nation has reduced CO2 \\nemissions by 862 million tons. Today, the U.S. is responsible for only \\n15 percent of global CO2 emissions. During roughly the same \\nperiod, China increased its emissions by 4 billion tons and India by \\n1.3 billion tons.\\n  Needless to say, the GND doesn't explain how we would compel other \\nnations to change their behavior. But domestically, as I have said, we \\nare going to emasculate our economy.

The Green New Deal would only add \\ntrillions more while simultaneously destroying the American economy, \\nwhich not only means families across our Nation would lose their \\nability to sustain themselves, but it would also shut down the \\ninnovation engine of the world.\\n  The 27th District of Texas, which I represent, has a better approach. \\nWe are home to a diverse energy portfolio, which includes wind, \\nnuclear, LNG, oil production--not to mention our fair share of cows and \\nairplanes.\\n  We are home to a safe, reliable nuclear power plant in Matagorda \\nCounty that generates 2.7 gigawatts of power, and that is a power of \\nnearly 2 million Texas homes and businesses.

It would lead to a total government takeover of \\njust about every aspect of our lives.\\n  Now, it is interesting to watch, since the deal was proposed not that \\nmany days ago, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of \\nthem are starting to back away from it. There were 67 coauthors on \\nthat. We are seeing some starting to back away, saying, well, this \\nreally isn't the dream or the deal; it is more of an aspiration.\\n  Well, by the time you freaked out half the country with these ideas \\nthat you put into legislation, maybe we need a little more heads-up on \\nwhat really is the goal here.\\n  Some of the guarantees in it:\\n  A government paycheck for those unwilling to work.\\n  Is that really in there? What are we talking about here?\\n  The cost of this implementation? $93 trillion, quadruple of what our \\nnational debt is right now. The cost will be passed on, of course, to--\\nas always--the taxpayer, to families, to those struggling--especially \\nmiddle-income folks--who could see their energy bills going up from \\nalready at a high point to an additional $4,000 annually per family.\\n  We should really have our supporters of this bill benefit from the \\nlessons learned in California on the high-speed rail boondoggle that \\ntripled in a short amount of time soon after it was barely approved, \\n$10 billion by the taxpayers to a nearly $100 billion project, all \\nunder the guise of saving greenhouse gases.\\n  Except during the construction of the high-speed rail in California, \\nit will make a whole bunch of greenhouse gases with the equipment \\ninvolved, so we are going to plant trees to offset that. Yet, at the \\nsame time, they are running the rails through hundreds of acres of \\nalmond trees in the middle of California that they are supposed to be \\noffsetting.\\n  It is a reckless attempt to undermine America's increasing \\ndominance--not just energy independence--but now dominance in energy \\naround the world.\\n  It ignores the basic reality; a lot of what America was built upon \\nwere indeed fossil fuels, those known reserves that we have in this \\ncountry.\\n  Now, let's talk a little bit about the Paris accord that I think \\nPresident Trump rightfully withdrew the United States from. The goal \\nbeing greenhouse gas reduction, CO2 reduction.\\n  Well, when you look at the stats, who is already leading the way \\noutside of the accord? The U.S.--of those western countries--is the \\nonly one that has actually reduced its number of CO2 in that \\namount of time.\\n  We are the ones doing it. You know why? Because we have freedom; \\nbecause we have the ability to innovate here, to invent the new \\ntechnology, to invent the things that are going to help us do things \\nbetter and cleaner into the future.\\n  I don't hear a lot of talk on this about new hydropower, which is \\nclean and ready to go any time you turn on the switch to the gates to \\nallow the turbines to flow.\\n  Biomass. In my area of the country--the Western Caucus, my colleagues \\nhere--we burn part of the west every year. We should be putting that \\nfuel into clean burning power plants to make electricity, cleaning our \\nforest, making it more fire-safe, better for the wildlife, better for \\nthe environment, not having all that CO2 go up. And then \\ncreating jobs in our backyard to get people to work from cleaning up \\nthe over-inventory the U.S. forest and BLM has from allowing their \\nforest to run rampant with no management for the last 100 years.\\n  These are things we should be talking about, not this green dream \\nthing. Instead, we are going to hear nothing but climate change, \\nclimate change, climate change, with solutions that just harness or \\nhandcuff the economy, the jobs, and the people of this country inside \\nthis chamber and in the real world out there where people actually \\nproduce things.\\n  We need to focus on the things that we know can work, producing \\nenergy with hydropower. Yes, with nuclear power, no emissions. With \\nbiomass, help clean that inventory that burns hundreds of thousands of \\nacres every year of forest land, and put it to work for us.\\n  That is what we are going to be successful at, because the United \\nStates is always number one in developing the new technology, the new \\nways to do cleaner, better, more efficiently, instead of handcuffing \\nour economy and that innovation and exporting it somewhere else.\\n  I do agree with my colleagues that have spoken here tonight.

His multifaceted \\ncareer path included time spent as a proud small business owner of \\nMartinez Tire and Supply, a construction safety supervisor for the \\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), and as an ordained \\nminister. A faithful and steadfast Christian, Andy served as the \\ninterim pastor of Faith Memorial Baptist Church, and was an active \\nmember of several other churches in the Huntsville area.\\n  Andy's faithfulness, generosity, and love for those around him was \\nnot only evident on Sundays--it was visible every day of his life. Andy \\nserved the Huntsville community in a variety of public roles. He was an \\nelected member of the Huntsville City Council, the Director for Trinity \\nRiver Authority's Walker County Area, a member of the Board of Trustees \\nfor Huntsville lSD, and Chairman of the Republican Party of Walker \\nCounty. Andy also acted as a Prison Ministry Volunteer in Huntsville--a \\nposition he held for over 30 remarkable years. Those who knew Andy will \\nattest to his sincere selflessness. He always worked towards leaving \\nthe Huntsville community better than he found it.\\n  Ila Martinez was Andy's wonderful wife of over 63 years and was not \\nonly a devoted partner to him, but was a loving mother and active in \\nthe community as well. A leading member of the Republican Party of \\nWalker County, Ila was involved in the Red Hat Ladies and the Calendar \\nGirls, a group of friends from Conroe High School that would meet once \\na month at lunchtime. Ila had a great love for volunteering and was \\noften working with the Walker County Republican women or at her church \\nlibrary. Ila was a doting grandmother and her greatest pleasure was \\nteaching her beloved granddaughters how to sew and bake.\\n  Andy and Ila had two daughters, Andrea Scott and the late Debbie \\nMartinez, and a son, Russell Martinez. Andy and Ila are survived by \\nAndrea and her husband Wayne; their son, Russell; two beautiful \\ngrandchildren, Angela Stacks and husband Jared; Mika Spears and her \\nhusband Neal; and three great-grandchildren: Draper Stacks, Megan \\nAnthony, and Trent Spears.\\n  The legacy of Andy and Ila will always be a part of the Huntsville \\ncommunity, kept alive in the hearts of those who knew and loved them. \\nBoth were selfless servants dedicated to bettering the lives of those \\naround them, and they will be greatly missed.\\n\", cat_list={'Education', 'Other'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=1490, text=\"  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am on the floor to talk about a vote \\nthat simply should not have taken place this evening. It was a vote on \\nyet another attack from our Republican colleagues on women's health and \\ntheir right to access safe, legal abortions--this time in the form of \\nan anti-doctor, anti-woman, anti-family piece of legislation that \\nmedical experts strongly oppose. Republicans have spread a lot of \\nmisinformation about this bill, so let's be clear what it is not about \\nand what it is actually about.\\n  This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have \\nclaimed, because that is not up for debate, and it is already the law. \\nThis bill is also not at all about ensuring that appropriate medical \\ncare is delivered, because it would make it harder for healthcare \\nproviders to provide high-quality medical care that their patients need \\nand deserve.\\n  The leading nonpartisan organization of OB/GYNs in our country has \\nsaid this bill should never become law. It calls it ``gross legislative \\ninterference into the practice of medicine'' and ``part of a larger \\nattempt to deny women access to safe, legal, evidence-based abortion \\ncare.'' In fact, 17 top health and medical organizations wrote to \\nCongress to insist that Democrats and Republicans vote this bill down.\\n  Since this bill is not about infants or appropriate medical care, I \\nam sure many people are wondering what exactly it is about. What would \\nthis bill really mean for women and families and healthcare providers?\\n  If you are a woman, this bill would mean, if you were one of the \\nvery, very few women who needed an abortion late in your pregnancy, you \\ncould be legally required to accept inappropriate, medically \\nunnecessary care--care that may directly conflict with your wishes at a \\ndeeply personal, often incredibly painful moment in your life--because \\npoliticians in Washington decided their beliefs mattered more than \\nyours.\\n  If you are a medical provider, this bill would supersede your years \\nof medical training and your oath to deliver the best possible medical \\ntreatment to your patients. It would apply a one-size-fits-all set of \\nrequirements that does not reflect the reality that every pregnancy is \\ndifferent, and it would subject you to criminal penalties if you were \\nto choose to let medical standards, not politics, drive the care you \\noffer to your patients.\\n  For families who struggle with the painful reality that the children \\nthey had hoped for could not survive, as is tragically the case in many \\nof the cases we are discussing, this legislation would take precedence \\nover families' wishes as they grieve.\\n  This bill is government interference in women's healthcare, in \\nfamilies' lives, and in medicine on steroids. As I said, it is anti-\\ndoctor, anti-woman, and anti-family. It has no place in becoming law. \\nIts proponents claim it would make something illegal that is already \\nillegal. So why are we debating this legislation that would take women \\nbackward when there are so many ways we should be advancing medicine, \\nimproving women's healthcare, and supporting families? As far as I can \\ntell, it is because this bill is about something that Republicans care \\nabout more than almost any other priority; that, unfortunately, is the \\nrolling back of women's constitutionally protected rights and trying to \\ntake us back in time before the Roe v. Wade decision.\\n  Since day No. 1 of the Trump-Pence administration, this party has \\npulled every possible stop to appeal to its extreme anti-abortion base. \\nJust last week, the Trump-Pence administration put forward a rule that \\nwould prevent healthcare providers at clinics that are funded through \\nthe title X family planning program from so much as informing patients \\nabout where to get an abortion even if that patient directly asks them \\nfor advice. This rule means trusted medical providers across the \\ncountry may not be able to serve women and men who rely on them for \\ncontraception, cancer screenings, and more--all because Republicans are \\ndetermined to make abortion impossible in the United States. That is \\njust one of many examples.\\n  To recap, this bill is completely unnecessary. It is harmful to women \\nand families, and it would criminalize doctors. It is intended to do \\nnothing except to help Republicans advance their goal of denying women \\ntheir constitutionally protected rights. I am against it in the \\nstrongest terms. Everybody who cares about women, families, and doctors \\nand about upholding the Constitution should be too, so I am glad the \\nSenate voted tonight to stop this anti-doctor, anti-woman, anti-family \\nbill from going a single step further.\\n  The next time Republicans want to have a conversation about \\nprotecting infants and children, I am happy to talk about the babies \\nand children who have been separated from their parents at the border \\nor about improving access to early childhood education or about making \\nsure coverage for maternal healthcare and preexisting conditions is not \\ntaken away. These are problems that do exist and that do need to be \\nsolved, and we are just as ready and willing to work on those as we are \\nto stand up and say ``absolutely not'' to this harmful bill.\\n\\n\\n                      Nomination of Eric D. Miller\\n\\n  Mr. President, in the very near future, my Senate colleagues will be \\nasked to take an unprecedented vote--a vote that never should have been \\nscheduled here in the first place.\\n  Republican leaders are demanding that we move ahead and vote on \\nPresident Trump's nominee to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court despite \\nthe fact that I and my colleague Senator Cantwell have not returned our \\nblue slips on behalf of our constituents in Washington State and \\ndespite the fact that the hearing for the nominee was a total sham. \\nThis is wrong, and it is a dangerous road for the Senate to go down. \\nNot only did Republicans schedule this nominee's confirmation hearing \\nduring a recess period when just two Senators--both Republicans--were \\nable to attend, but the hearing included less than 5 minutes of \\nquestioning--less questioning for a lifetime appointment than most \\nstudents face for a book report in school.\\n  Confirming this Ninth Circuit Court nominee without the consent or \\ntrue input of both home State Senators and after a sham hearing would \\nbe a dangerous first for this Senate.\\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is a question of the Senate's \\nability and commitment to properly review nominees. Yet, here we are on \\nthe Senate floor, barreling toward a vote to confirm a flawed nominee, \\nwho came to us following a flawed nomination process--all because a \\nhandful of my Republican colleagues will apparently stop at nothing to \\njam President Trump's extreme conservatives onto our courts, even if \\nthat means trampling all over precedent, all over process, or any \\nsemblance of our institutional norms.\\n  Maybe Republican leaders are hoping most Americans aren't paying \\nattention to what is happening right now in the Senate--that somehow \\ntossing out Senate norms in order to move our country's courts to the \\nfar right will go unnoticed.\\n  Well, I am standing here right now to make sure everyone knows \\nbecause I, for one, fear the short- and long-term consequences of \\nletting any President steamroll the Senate on something as critical as \\nour judicial nominees--the very men and women who are tasked with \\ninterpreting our Nation's laws and making sure they serve justice for \\nall Americans.\\n  I fear the consequences of abandoning the blue-slip process and, \\ninstead, bending to the will of a President who has demonstrated time \\nand again his ignorance and disdain for the Constitution and the rule \\nof law.\\n  At a time when we have a President whose policies keep testing the \\nlimits of law--from a ban on Muslims entering the United States to a \\nfamily separation policy at our southern border--it is very important, \\nmore than ever, that we have well-qualified, consensus judges on the \\nbench.\\n  Let's be very clear. Trump cannot steamroll the Senate by himself. \\nBut in\\n\\n\\nthe Republican leadership, he has found Members willing to throw out \\nevery rule, every tradition, every safeguard in the book to give him \\nwhat he wants.\\n  So this vote, which is happening soon, and this new precedent of \\nturning a blind eye to the blue slip should stop every one of my \\ncolleagues--Republicans and Democrats--in their tracks because, today, \\nthe two home Senators still holding their blue slips are my colleague \\nSenator Cantwell and me, but in the future, it could be any Member of \\nthis body.\\n  I am doing this for very good reasons--reasons very much in line with \\nwhy the blue-slip process exists in the first place. I am doing this \\nbecause I don't believe Mr. Miller has received the necessary scrutiny \\nand vetting to serve on the bench--a lifetime appointment. I believe \\nthe people I represent would not want him there, plain and simple.\\n  I want to briefly go into one area that causes particular and very \\nserious concern, and that is what I have heard from my constituents \\nabout Mr. Miller's misunderstanding of Tribal sovereignty and his \\nability to be impartial and fair-minded when hearing cases involving \\nTribal rights.\\n  As one Tribal leader from my home State put it, Mr. Miller has built \\na career out of mounting challenges against Tribes, including their \\nsovereignty, their lands, their religious freedom, and even the core \\nattributes of Federal recognition.\\n  I want to be very clear because I do not believe that it is wise for \\nSenators to support or oppose nominees only because of their past \\nclients. Our legal system requires talented lawyers on both sides of \\nevery case, and sometimes lawyers represent clients who are politically \\nunpopular.\\n  But making a career decision to be one of the top attorneys, in case \\nafter case, attacking Tribal sovereignty--that is more than a choice of \\na client. That is a choice about values, and it is something my \\ncolleagues should consider.\\n  There are more than 400 federally recognized Tribes in the Western \\nUnited States, including Alaska. Every single one could find themselves \\nbefore the Ninth Circuit and before a judge who spent years fighting \\nfor an extreme position directly opposed to their own sovereignty and \\nwhose advocacy repeatedly attempted to undermine the rights of Tribal \\nnations everywhere. Particularly at a time when the Supreme Court may \\ndemolish important protections for subsistence rights, a circuit \\nnominee opposed to Tribal sovereignty should not be confirmed.\\n  This is a serious matter worthy of true examination. Yet Mr. Miller's \\nnomination process was inadequate from the start.\\n  Today it is Washington State families who are getting cut out from \\nthis important process. Tomorrow, it can be the concerns of any of your \\nconstituents and any of your home States that get tossed aside for a \\nPresident's crusade to reshape our courts and satisfy a political \\nbase--and Senate leaders unwilling to stand up for our norms and our \\nprecedents and our constitutional duty.\\n  I urge my colleagues to truly think about what moving ahead with this \\nnomination means and to ask themselves: Are we still able to work \\ntogether in a bipartisan way and find common ground for the good of the \\ncountry and the people we serve? Can we still engage in a bipartisan \\nprocess to find consensus candidates to serve on our courts? Or will \\nour work here in the U.S. Senate be reduced to partisan extremes and \\npolitical gamesmanship?\\n  Will Republicans accept simply being a rubberstamp for their leader \\nin the White House, and will my colleagues be complicit in allowing our \\ncourts to be taken over by ideology alone, abandoning pragmatism and a \\ncommitment to justice for all?\\n  That is the choice every Senator will make with this vote, and I \\nsincerely hope a choice for which every Senator will be held \\naccountable.\\n  To vote yes will be a vote in favor of further eroding the Senate's \\ncommitment to examining nominees for lifetime appointments and its \\nability to serve as a check on the Executive. To vote yes is to toss \\naway each Senator's ability to provide guidance on judicial nominees \\nfor their State and the families they represent.\\n  To vote no will be a vote to stand up for the Senate's role in our \\ndemocracy and to stand up for a process that helps the Senate ensure \\nqualified judges who play such a critically important role in our \\ndemocracy. To me, the choice is pretty clear.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Education', 'Abortion'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1492, text=\"  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join many of my \\ncolleagues in raising our voices on behalf of some of the most \\nvulnerable members of our society.\\n  Recently, a very disturbing and revealing discussion has been taking \\nplace in our country that raises serious questions about how much value \\nand worth we ascribe to babies in the womb, especially those who are \\nborn despite an attempted abortion procedure.\\n  Before I go any further, let me say this clearly and unequivocally: \\nIf we as a nation are to hold any claim to a moral character that \\ndeserves to be admired and emulated, then we must be willing to say \\nthat the lives of newborn children have inherent value and are worthy \\nof protection. There is simply no way to credibly claim otherwise.\\n  Whether it be legislation introduced or enacted by State legislatures \\nor comments made by public officials, such as the Governor of Virginia, \\nour country has begun to entertain the idea that the rights and \\nprivileges newborn babies possess is an open-ended question.\\n  This is alarming, and the U.S. Senate should go on the record in \\ndefense of their right to live instead of being callously discarded or \\nworse--intentionally killed in the name of reproductive freedom. There \\nis no middle ground here.\\n  It is concerning to me that in some corners of this country, and even \\nwithin this Congress, there is an utter failure to recognize and affirm \\nthe right to life, especially after an infant has already been born.\\n  Throughout my time in elected office, I have found that giving those \\nwho disagree with me on any given issue the benefit of the doubt as it \\nrelates to their motivations has allowed me to consistently find \\ncommonality and reach compromise, even with incredibly unlikely allies \\nand partners. But in this instance, there can be no mistake or \\nambiguity. The common ground that we all must occupy should be a shared \\ncommitment to uphold the basic, fundamental right to protect the life \\nof every child, no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, which \\nbrings me to the legislation before the Senate today.\\n\\n  I am a cosponsor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, \\nand I am grateful to each of my colleagues who supported the bill \\ntonight. This legislation would create criminal penalties for doctors \\nwho allow infants to die rather than provide medical care after an \\nattempted abortion.\\n  It would also require that born-alive abortion survivors be \\ntransported to a hospital for care and treatment rather than being left \\nto languish on the counter of an abortion clinic or--as one former \\nnurse and pro-life activist has shockingly recounted--be discarded \\nalong with the biohazard materials.\\n  Even in situations where comfort care is rendered to these little \\nones, that sometimes amounts to nothing more than keeping a baby warm \\nuntil it passes away alone. No child should suffer this way.\\n  Under this bill, abortionists who defy these mandates to render care \\nto born-alive survivors would face the justice that they are due \\ninstead of being ignored or permitted to continue committing \\ninfanticide.\\n  It is time for our country to demand that the victims of this \\nabhorrent, inhumane treatment be afforded their rights and the \\nperpetrators be held accountable.\\n  Speaking with one clear voice, we must say that every human being is \\nmade in the image of God and is therefore in possession of dignity and \\nworth that cannot be displaced or dispossessed. Anything short of this \\nunambiguous declaration would be a tremendous disservice to our \\nchildren and fatally undermine the values of our society that we claim \\nto uphold.\\n\\n\\n  While the debate surrounding abortion has engulfed this country for \\ndecades, the goalposts are now being shifted. Reproductive autonomy, we \\nare now told, must include the ability and choice to end the life of a \\nbaby who survives an attempted abortion.\\n  As a former medical provider, I believe that to end a newborn's life \\neither by refusing to provide lifesaving care or actively taking that \\nchild's life--as in the case of the infamous abortionist Dr. Kermit \\nGosnell and others--violates the oath every medical provider takes to \\ndo no harm.\\n  As a dad and a grandfather, I know from my own experience just how \\nprecious each life is. My daughters and grandchildren are treasured \\ngifts that bring my family and me immeasurable joy. To think that they \\nor any other child might be treated with anything other than the \\ndignity and respect they are entitled to is tragic, heartbreaking, and \\noutrageous.\\n  Providing necessary medical attention to save the lives of infants \\nwho survive an abortion is an imperative that we as a society must \\nembrace if we are to be faithful to the promise our Founders made to \\nthe generations of Americans who would succeed them. In declaring the \\nself-evident truth that all men are created equal, surely they intended \\nto extend the same rights and liberties that their countrymen fought \\nand died for to newborn babies who survive abortions.\\n  I am proud to have stood with my colleagues today in support of this \\nlegislation that seeks to protect these precious, vulnerable lives. We \\ncan and should do this as a reflection of the country we want to be.\\n  Our abortion laws in the United States already situate us among some \\nof the world's worst human rights abusers, including North Korea and \\nChina.\\n  Now a national conversation about whether to provide children who \\nsurvive abortions medical attention and care has ensued. It is my hope \\nand prayer that the final word in this discussion will end with a \\nresounding commitment to protect and preserve life.\\n  I would like to thank the junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Sasse, \\nfor leading on this critical issue and pushing to bring this measure to \\nthe floor today.\\n  I would also like to thank the President for his vocal commitment to \\ndefending life and protecting the most vulnerable among us.\\n  I feel blessed to stand alongside so many others to raise our voices \\non behalf of the voiceless.\\n  While I am disappointed with the result of today's vote, I remain \\ncommitted to fighting for those who are unable to fight for themselves \\nand will continue working to protect and uphold the sanctity of life.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1494, text=\"  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to offer some thoughts regarding the \\nongoing negotiations with North Korea that began with the Singapore \\nsummit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un and will continue in a \\nfew days when the two leaders meet again in Vietnam.\\n  I join the chorus of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \\nhave expressed concern regarding the outcome of the last summit and the \\nsubsequent negotiations. This is not meant as a criticism of the \\ndiplomatic process itself. Clearly, we are in a much better place now \\nthan 2 years ago, when the President was promising fire and fury for \\nthe Korean Peninsula, terrifying our South Korean allies, who stand to \\nlose millions of their citizens in any confrontation with North Korea. \\nFurthermore, if the Singapore summit had resulted in a clear path \\ntoward denuclearization, I would be standing here right now commending \\nthese diplomatic efforts.\\n  The maximum pressure campaign, significantly enhanced by this body's \\nsanctions regime and the United Nations Security Council's resolutions, \\nbrought North Korea to the negotiating table. It was a golden \\nopportunity and, unfortunately, it was squandered by this ill-prepared \\nadministration, which seems more concerned with photo ops than with the \\nsubstance of the negotiation.\\n  The Singapore summit was a loss for the United States and our \\nalliances and a great publicity win for North Korea. The 2005 six-party \\njoint statement contained significantly more commitments from North \\nKorea than the joint statement of the Singapore summit. Given President \\nTrump's bluster and renouncement of the JCPOA, one would have thought \\nthat he would leave Singapore with an ironclad commitment and schedule \\nfor denuclearization. Instead, he got less than in any past negotiation \\nwith North Korea.\\n  Most concerning to me is that without obtaining a single concrete \\nconcession from North Korea, President Trump undermined our alliance \\nwith the Republic of Korea by characterizing our joint exercises as \\nprovocative war games. It was a huge propaganda win for North Korea and \\na huge loss to the United States and to the readiness of the joint \\nforce. The regularly scheduled exercises are very important to troop \\nreadiness and our regional security. While I understand the need to \\ncreate diplomatic space for these negotiations to proceed, we must \\nensure that we do not sacrifice readiness for empty promises.\\n  While I am pleased with the agreement on the return of prisoners of \\nwar and missing-in-action personnel remains, which rightfully continue \\nto be important issues for U.S. families, the Singapore summit was \\nmostly pomp and circumstance that did not advance our national security \\ninterests. In fact, it could be said that we are in a worse position \\nthan we were before the summit. President Trump undeservedly \\ntransformed Kim Jong Un from a ruthless dictator to a world statesman \\nin short order. He has since used his stature from the summit to make \\nclosed-door deals with China and Russia that will be used as leverage \\nagainst the United States.\\n  The President also conferred legitimacy on a corrupt and morally \\nbankrupt dictator who has imprisoned hundreds of thousands of men, \\nwomen, and children in political camps under brutal conditions and has \\ncommitted horrendous crimes against his neighbors and own people. Human \\nrights did not play a prominent role at the summit, and the joint \\ndeclaration does not include one single reference. If we want to \\ncontinue to serve as a beacon for human rights, this issue will have to \\nbe on the agenda for these negotiations. There are a number of U.S. \\nsanctions against North Korea because of its human rights record, and \\nthis body will not loosen those sanctions until and unless we see \\nprogress on the issue. As such, I was dismayed that the President in \\nhis State of the Union Address did not call out the North Korean \\nregime's callous disregard for human rights.\\n  Since the summit, we have seen just how problematic the joint \\ndeclaration has been as a foundational document for the negotiations. \\nWhile Secretary Pompeo characterized the first meeting with North \\nKorean negotiators at the summit as ``productive,'' the North Koreans \\ncriticized Secretary Pompeo's gangster-like demand for \\ndenuclearization. The chasm between the two sides was created by the \\nambiguity of the summit itself and its failure to create an agreed-upon \\npath for both parties. We have not seen a substantial dismantlement of \\nnuclear or missile sites over the last year, and independent news \\nreporting reflects that North Korea continues to develop its nuclear \\nand missile arsenals despite the self-imposed ban on testing.\\n  What should we have gotten from the summit? Since we played our \\nbiggest card and gave Kim Jong Un a meeting with the President of the \\nUnited States, the answer is a lot more than what we did get. First and \\nforemost, we should have gotten a joint declaration that North Korea \\nagrees to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. If \\nwe were not going to get that commitment, then we should have at least \\ngotten a specific commitment similar to the September 19, 2005, joint \\nstatement, where North Korea committed to ``abandoning all nuclear \\nweapons and existing nuclear programs and returning at an early date to \\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA \\nsafeguards.'' Instead, we got a vague statement that North Korea will \\n``work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''\\n\\n\\n  Despite the administration's protestations to the contrary, it is not \\nat all clear that North Korea actually agreed to complete, verifiable, \\nand irreversible denuclearization, generally referred to as CVID. I am \\nconcerned, as are others, that the words ``complete denuclearization'' \\nwere used because the North Koreans would not agree to CVID. If that is \\nthe case, then, we are starting in a worse place than we were during \\nthe 2005 talks.\\n\\n  Why do these words matter? They matter because of the historical \\ncontext of these negotiations. Without the word ``verifiable,'' North \\nKorea has not agreed to inspections, and, without inspections, we \\ncannot be sure that North Korea will take the steps necessary to \\ndenuclearize. The regime does not have a good track record of living up \\nto its agreements. Without a verification process that includes a \\nrobust inspection and verification regime, we will never be sure that \\nNorth Korea is not reverting to its past tactics and cheating on its \\ncommitments.\\n  Even more alarming to those who follow past negotiations is that the \\ncommitment that did come out of the summit sounds suspiciously like the \\ntack North Korea has taken in past negotiations--that denuclearization \\nof the peninsula will require the United States to remove its nuclear \\numbrella from its ally, the Republic of Korea, and remove its troops \\nfrom the peninsula. North Korea has peddled this tit-for-tat \\ndenuclearization narrative for years, and this administration must \\nensure that it does not become the narrative of the upcoming \\nnegotiations. These competing narratives should have been reconciled at \\nthe summit by the leaders but instead were left for future \\nnegotiations.\\n  The administration now has another opportunity in Vietnam to \\nestablish some credibility for these negotiations and demand a set of \\nconcrete deliverables. We should all recognize that CVID will take \\nyears to accomplish. Despite President Trump's patently false claim \\nthat he has solved the North Korean nuclear threat, that threat is \\nstill very real and very dangerous. There are commitments that we need \\nfrom the other side to gauge whether North Korea is sincere in its \\nintent to denuclearize. We already know that the intelligence community \\nhas made the determination that North Korea does not intend to \\ndenuclearize. Therefore, the concessions we seek from North Korea need \\nto include a verification and inspection scheme that includes a \\nreasonable timeline and is comprehensive enough to include all of its \\nweapons of mass destruction programs and facilities and focuses on \\nengagement instead of punishment. We should not use inspections as \\n``aha'' moments to catch the North Koreans in intentional or \\nunintentional mistakes. Instead, they should be used as the foundation \\nto develop a comprehensive picture of all of North Korea's weapons \\nprograms and as the basis for future negotiations.\\n  What would a successful summit in Vietnam look like? We need a \\ndeclaration from North Korea of all of its nuclear weapons and programs \\nand facilities. Ideally, it would also include a catalog of all of its \\nmissiles and missile facilities. This declaration of all of its sites \\nand programs needs to be provided to the United States in short order \\nto allow the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, \\ninspectors to start the inspections process, which will take years.\\n  Second, we need North Korea to agree to verifiable denuclearization \\nwith IAEA inspections, and that agreement should include a concrete \\ntimeline with a step-by-step process. If we are going to continue to \\nscope down our joint exercises for the sake of these negotiations, \\nthen, we need to see concrete actions by North Korea in the next few \\nmonths. It has been almost a year since the last summit, and we have \\nnot seen any concrete irreversible actions taken by North Korea on its \\nnuclear program that signify an intent by the regime to give up or \\nsignificantly curtail its programs.\\n  I wanted to speak on this issue today before the second summit \\nbecause I am concerned that the President will fall prey to North \\nKorean manipulation and accept an agreement that does not include \\nsignificant concessions by the regime. Kim Jong Un's ploy is to make \\ncommitments for the future that can easily be forgotten or to offer up \\nfacilities or sites that are obsolete.\\n  For example, if the President gets assurances for the dismantling of \\nthe Sohae launch facility and the closure and inspections of the \\nYongbyon nuclear facility, he may think that North Korea has moved the \\nneedle on denuclearization, but as the experts will tell you, the real \\njewels are other nuclear sites that are more critical for the regime's \\nprograms. As recent reports by the Center for Strategic and \\nInternational Studies have shown, there are many missile sites that \\nhave not been declared and that are critical to the nuclear program. \\nThis is why a full declaration is so critical--so that we finally have \\na comprehensive accounting of the nuclear and missile programs that \\nexist.\\n  In the meantime, the administration also needs to be vigilant that \\nChina and other countries continue to enforce sanctions. President \\nTrump's assertions that the problem is solved will significantly \\nundercut our ability to keep the pressure on. We need consistent \\nmessaging from the White House and the rest of the administration that \\nthe Singapore summit was the first step, and until we see concrete \\nresults, there will be no abeyance of the sanctions regime. Keeping \\nChina in line on that front will be a significant challenge, especially \\ngiven the isolationist bent of this President, who has managed to \\nalienate the very partners we need to cooperate on the sanctions \\nregime.\\n  China does not need to state publicly that it will stop enforcing \\nsanctions. Even low-level cross-border trade can allow the North Korean \\neconomy to hobble along for years, and all it will take is an \\nindication from Beijing that sanctions enforcement is no longer a \\npriority.\\n  Let me be clear. One of the most important outcomes of this process \\nis also the preservation of our alliances with South Korea and Japan. \\nEven if we were to somehow achieve a CVID deal with North Korea but \\nlose our special relationships with these two nations, we will come out \\nthe other side less secure than we are today. While North Korea poses a \\nsignificant threat to the United States, peace on the peninsula cannot \\ncome at the cost of a diminished U.S. presence in Asia. Our alliances \\nand partners in the region are the bulwark of our strength in the \\nregion.\\n  Both South Korea and Japan have significant national security \\ninterests that will be adjudicated during these negotiations. Neither \\nis at the negotiating table. I am very concerned that Japan in \\nparticular is dismayed that there has not been any substantive progress \\nin the negotiations. It is critical that the administration continue to \\nraise issues that are critical to Japan, especially the Japanese \\ncitizens who were abducted by North Korea. It is up to this \\nadministration to ensure that their interests are voiced and that their \\nsecurity needs are met. That means not only addressing North Korea's \\nintercontinental ballistic missile program but also its short- and \\nintermediate-range missiles. It means consulting with our allies before \\nsignificant decisions that affect their security are taken, and it \\nmeans not publicly lamenting about the costs associated with these \\nhistoric and strategic alliances. We cannot simply put a price tag on \\nour regional security. Losing these alliances will cost us far more in \\nthe long run and leave us far less secure than we are today.\\n  We also need to be concerned about the recent deterioration of the \\nrelationship between our two critical allies. Trilateral cooperation is \\nonly effective if South Korea and Japan can overcome their historical \\nanimosities to present a united front against North Korea.\\n  I know there is a lot of discussion today about the possibility of a \\npeace agreement to end the 65-year-old armistice. I fear that many see \\na peace agreement as the precursor for a removal of U.S. forces from \\nthe Korean Peninsula. I am concerned that our President does not \\nunderstand the critical importance of the deployment of U.S. Forces \\nKorea on the peninsula.\\n  Let me be clear. The withdrawal of troops from the peninsula would \\nsignificantly undermine our ability to fulfill our treaty obligations \\nto South Korea. It should not be a subject of these negotiations or any \\nfuture negotiations with North Korea. The presence of our troops is the \\ncornerstone of our military alliance with South\\n\\n\\nKorea, and they must remain present and ready to ``Fight Tonight'' for \\nthe benefit of the alliance and regional security.\\n  Looming over all of this is our long-term strategic competition with \\nChina. I find it telling that China was one of the first countries to \\nannounce the cancellation of our joint exercises with the Republic of \\nKorea.\\n  What are China's ambitions for this negotiation process? While China \\nis certainly concerned about the nuclear arsenal its southern neighbor \\nhas amassed, denuclearization may not be China's highest national \\nsecurity concern during these negotiations. In the long run, China \\nrecognizes that its near-peer competition with the United States \\ncomplicates its interests in these negotiations. China's highest \\npriority is likely to ensure that it does not end up with a U.S.-allied \\nreunified Korea on its southern border. Another goal is driving a wedge \\nbetween the United States and its allies in order to promote itself as \\na regional hegemon.\\n\\n  We all recognize that Russia has similar ambitions--separate us from \\nour allies, establish themselves as regional hegemons, and coerce and \\nbully their smaller neighbors on issues of defense, trade, and \\neconomics. We cannot allow that to happen.\\n  We already see attempts by China to relax sanctions enforcement. This \\ntrade spat is just one of the wedges North Korea will be able to \\nleverage between China and the United States. We need a coordinated \\nstrategy that keeps our long-term interests in Asia focused while \\nresolving the North Korean crisis. To date, we have not seen any \\nindication that such a strategy exists.\\n  Peace on the Korean Peninsula has eluded us for decades. There is an \\nopportunity now to force Kim Jong Un's hand, through skillful \\nnegotiation and a coordinated sanctions regime, to take concrete steps \\ntoward denuclearization.\\n  I hope this administration will use the Vietnam summit to negotiate a \\nsubstantive agreement that keeps America and its allies safe, strong, \\nand secure.\\n  With that, I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1496, text=\"  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am here to take the opportunity to join \\nmy colleagues to speak in support of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors \\nProtection Act. I thank Senator Sasse for his continued leadership on \\nthis issue. I supported the bill when Senator Sasse introduced it last \\nCongress, and I was glad to see Senator McConnell, our leader, bring \\nthis bill to the floor for a vote.\\n  I am astonished--astonished--that we are debating whether it is \\nappropriate to leave born children to die. Today, now, in the year of \\n2019, how can this be? Science demonstrates that human life begins at \\nconception, and our understanding of neonatal development is increasing \\nevery day.\\n  I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \\nHealth and Human Services. The National Institutes of Health is one of \\nmy top priorities for funding. At the NIH, the National Institute of \\nChild Health and Human Development has advanced our knowledge of \\npregnancy and development in the womb. Under this Institute, the \\nNeonatal Research Network has pioneered research that has led to \\ntechniques that saved the lives of children in their earliest stages, \\nwhen these children are at their most vulnerable.\\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than 10,000 \\nbabies are aborted each year after 20 weeks of conception, when \\nscience--science--tells us that an unborn child can feel pain inside \\nthe womb. That number will increase as a result of recent State-level \\nefforts to end virtually any restriction on abortion when a child could \\nviably live outside the womb. These efforts are extreme and fall far \\nbeyond the mainstream of American opinion.\\n  This legislation does nothing to limit prenatal abortion. While we \\nmust address that issue--the root causes of abortion and the ways to \\ncurb this heartbreaking trend--that is not the issue at hand today in \\nthis legislation. The question before us is this: When a child survives \\nan abortion and is born, does the U.S. Senate believe the child can \\nstill be eliminated, or should the baby be protected and given all \\npossible care to survive? This act requires healthcare practitioners to \\n``exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence \\nto preserve the life and health of a child as a reasonably diligent and \\nconscientious healthcare practitioner would render to any other child \\nborn alive at the same gestational age.'' Any negligence in this regard \\nis subject to criminal and civil punishment, which at present does not \\nexist.\\n\\n  Should anyone think this is some made-up issue--despite the Virginia \\nGovernor's shocking comments revealing an openness to infanticide and \\nNew York's expansion of abortion well beyond the age of viability that \\nmakes born-alive abortion survivors more likely--we have concrete \\nevidence that this grotesque act happens. Notorious abortion provider \\nKermit Gosnell is serving life in prison for these very acts.\\n  Closing our eyes to what is obscene does not make it any less real. \\nThat it is allegedly ``rare'' doesn't make it any less real or \\nabhorrent. One child purposefully deprived of healthcare and allowed to \\ndie is one too many. It is infanticide, which brings us to the crux of \\nthis issue. We need to think carefully about the long-term impacts to \\nthe definition of ``healthcare'' if Congress refuses to act positively \\non this measure. Do the guardrails of neonatal health succumb to the \\nbelief that infants don't really count as one of us?\\n  Our society is not one of the ancient Romans or the Aztecs. We don't \\nsacrifice our children to please an unknown god. In the progress of \\nhuman history, principles of the enlightenment--also known as the Age \\nof Reason--declared self-evident truths that all humans are created \\nequal and endowed with the unalienable right to life. Although \\nundoubtedly we have our flaws, these enlightenment principles enshrined \\nin our founding documents remain true to who we are as a nation and who \\nwe are as human beings. We recoil when we hear of children who are \\nharmed in any manner. Yet today we are faced with a reality where the \\nability to terminate an unborn child's life when it is viable outside \\nof the womb is something that is not only tolerated but is passionately \\ndefended by the left.\\n  That is bad enough, but to see legislation ensuring that the medical \\ncare of born children gets blocked is incomprehensible. The immutable \\nmarch of progress in human history has met a roadblock today in the \\nU.S. Senate. The Age of Reason seems to have escaped us.\\n  Tonight, the Senate had an opportunity to send a message showing who \\nwe are as leaders and as a society as a whole--one that protects the \\nweak and the voiceless instead of one that permits their destruction. I \\nregret and I am saddened that the Senate failed this fundamental test.\\n  I am eager to do more to protect innocent life, including the unborn, \\nbut the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act provided us an opportunity to \\naffirm the most basic need for healthcare for a vulnerable child who \\nhas already beaten the odds to survive. Let's hope we have another \\nopportunity to give these children the chance at life they so deserve.\\n  I thank you.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Crime & Drugs', 'Abortion'})\n",

After a hearing at which Mr. Ryder \\nanswered questions, Republican and Democratic members of the \\nEnvironment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved his \\nnomination. No, there is no problem with Mr. Ryder.\\n  You might say: This must be a position of overwhelming complexity and \\nimportance that requires a year for all of us to think about it.\\n  TVA is the Nation's largest public utility, and it is important to \\nthe millions of us in the seven-State region for whom it provides \\nelectricity. But this is not a lifetime appointment. It is not a \\nCabinet position. It is not even a full-time position. This is one of \\nnine part-time board positions whose nominees are usually approved in \\nthe Senate by a voice vote.\\n  The problem is not with Mr. Ryder. It is not because of the unusual \\nimportance of the position. The problem is with the determination of \\nthe Democratic minority to make it nearly impossible for President \\nTrump to fill the 1,200 Federal Government positions that require \\nconfirmation by the U.S. Senate as part of our constitutional duty to \\nprovide advice and consent.\\n  This is where we are: Democrats have objected to the majority \\nleader's request to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination. As I mentioned, \\nthese are nominations normally approved by a voice vote. So in order to \\nhave a vote, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has filed a \\ncloture petition to cut off debate on Mr. Ryder's nomination.\\n  The cloture process takes at least 3 days. Here is how it works: The \\nfirst day, you file cloture. That is what Senator McConnell did. The \\nsecond day is a so-called intervening day when no action can be taken, \\nso nothing is happening. On the third day, the Senate votes to invoke \\ncloture, and then there is up to 30 more hours for postcloture debate \\nbefore the Senate can finally vote on whether to confirm Mr. Ryder.\\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder is not the only victim of such \\nobstructionism. During the last 2 years, Democrats have done what I \\njust described 128 times. One hundred and twenty-eight times they have \\nrequired the majority leader to consume up to 3 days to force a vote on \\na Presidential nominee. By comparison, requiring a cloture vote to \\nadvance a nomination happened 12 times during the first 2 years of \\nPresident Obama's term, compared to President Trump's 128 times; 4 \\ntimes during the first 2 years of George W. Bush's term, compared to \\nPresident Trump's 128 times; 12 times during Bill Clinton's first 2 \\nyears, compared to President Trump's 128 times. Not once during George \\nH. W. Bush's first 2 years in office was it necessary for the majority \\nleader to file cloture to cut off debate to advance a Presidential \\nnomination--not once--but it had to be done 128 times in the first 2 \\nyears of President Trump's time.\\n  This unnecessary obstruction has to change. The result of this \\nextraordinary delay in considering nominees creates a government filled \\nwith acting appointees who, never having gone through the Senate \\nconfirmation process, are less accountable to Congress and therefore \\nless accountable to the American people. So at a time when many \\ncomplain that the Executive has become too powerful, the Senate is \\ndeliberately making itself weaker by diminishing our constitutional \\nduty to advise and consent to individuals nominated to fill important \\npositions--perhaps the Senate's best known role.\\n  This abuse of power by the minority is about to produce an excessive \\nreaction by the majority--something that I think at least nine \\nDemocratic Senators who can see 2 years ahead would want to avoid. At \\nleast nine Democratic Senators hope to be the next President of the \\nUnited States. Do they not know that some Republicans will do to the \\nnext Democratic President's nominees what Democrats have done to \\nPresident Trump's nominees? Let me ask that again. Do the nine \\nDemocratic Senators who want to be the next President of the United \\nStates--that election is about 20 months away--not know that if they \\nare elected, some Republicans will do to them what Democrats have done \\nto President Trump's nominees?\\n  The Senate is a body of precedent. What goes around comes around. All \\nit takes will be one Republican Senator objecting to a unanimous \\nconsent request to make it difficult for the next Democratic President \\nto form a government, and this will continue the diminishment of the \\nU.S. Senate.\\n  Can Republican Senators, by majority vote, change Senate rules to \\nstop this obstruction? Yes, we can, and we will, if necessary. There \\nare several ways to change the rules of the Senate. We can amend the \\nstanding rules of the Senate. We can adopt a standing order. We can \\npass a law. We can set a new precedent. We can change the rules by \\nunanimous consent. All of these are rules of the Senate.\\n  The written rules of the Senate say it requires 67 votes to amend a \\nstanding rule and 60 votes to amend a standing order. There is recent \\nprecedent to change the Senate rules by a majority vote.\\n  In 2013, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, used a procedural \\nmaneuver--let's call it the Harry Reid precedent--that allowed the \\nDemocratic Senate majority to overrule the Chair and say, in effect, \\nthat a written Senate rule does not mean what its words say.\\n  Now, this is as if a referee in a football game were to say the \\nfollowing: The rule book says that a first down is 10 yards, but I am \\nthe referee, and I am ruling that a first down is 9 yards.\\n  Well, that is what happened in 2013. So, in 2017, what goes around \\ncomes around. The Republican majority followed this Harry Reid \\nprecedent in order to make cloture on all nominations a majority vote, \\nand now Republicans are on the verge again of following the Harry Reid \\nprecedent.\\n  Should Republicans do this, change a rule by majority vote, even \\nthough our written rules say it should be done by 60 or 67 votes? The \\nanswer is, no, we shouldn't, not if we can avoid it.\\n  As Senator Carl Levin said in 2013, when he opposed the Harry Reid \\nprecedent--Senator Levin is a Democrat, and he said: A Senate in which \\na majority can change its rule at any time is a Senate without any \\nrules.\\n  Thomas Jefferson, who wrote our first rules, said: It didn't make \\nmuch difference what the rules are. It just matters that there are some \\nrules.\\n  So it is at least awkward for Members of the country's chief rule-\\nwriting body, the U.S. Senate, to expect Americans to follow the rules \\nwe write for them when we don't follow our own written rules.\\n  I have heard many Democrats privately say to me, they express their \\nregret that they ever established the Harry Reid precedent in 2013. \\nThey didn't look ahead and see that what goes around comes around and \\nthat this is a body of precedent.\\n  So what would be the right thing for us to do--something that avoided \\nboth the minority's abuse of its rights and the majority's excessive \\nresponse. We should do what the Senate did in 2011, in 2012, and in \\n2013, when Republicans and Democrats worked together to make it easier \\nfor President Obama and his successors to gain confirmation of \\nPresidential nominees.\\n  As a Republican Senator, I spent dozens of hours on this bipartisan \\nproject to make it easier for a Democratic President with a Democratic \\nSenate majority to form a government. I thought that was the right \\nthing to do, and we changed the rules in the right way.\\n  The Senate passed standing orders with bipartisan support and a new \\nlaw, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, \\nwhich eliminated confirmation for several positions. That bipartisan \\nworking group of Senators accomplished a lot in 2011, 2012, and 2013.\\n  We eliminated secret holds. After over 25 years of bipartisan effort, \\nled by Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, we eliminated delays caused \\nby the reading of amendments. We eliminated Senate confirmation of 163 \\nmajor positions.\\n  Now, remember what we were doing was working in a bipartisan way to \\ntry to make it easier for President Obama and a Democratic majority in \\nthe Senate to confirm the 1,200 Presidential nominees that every \\nPresident has to send over here for advice and consent. We did it for \\nPresident Obama. We intended to do it for his successors as well.\\n  We eliminated 3,163 minor career positions. We made 272 positions so-\\ncalled privileged nominations, which means these nominations can move \\nfaster through the Senate. We sped up motions to proceed to \\nlegislation. We made it easier to go to conference. We\\n\\n\\nlimited postcloture debate on sub-Cabinet positions to 8 hours and on \\nFederal district judges to 2 hours for the 113th Congress. All of these \\nchanges took effect immediately over these 60 days.\\n  Let me underscore what I am about to say. Republicans did not insist, \\nin 2011, 2012, and 2013, when Barack Obama was President, that these \\nnew rules should be delayed until after the next Presidential election \\nwhen there might be a Republican President. Republicans supported these \\nchanges for the benefit of this institution, even though they would \\nimmediately benefit a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate \\nmajority.\\n  I propose that we do that again. I invite my Democratic colleagues to \\njoin me in demonstrating the same sort of bipartisan respect for the \\nSenate as an institution that Senators Reid and McConnell--the two \\nSenate leaders at that time--Senators Schumer, Barrasso, Levin, McCain, \\nKyl, Cardin, Collins, Lieberman, and I did in 2011, 2012, and 2013, \\nwhen we worked to change the Senate rules the right way.\\n  Now, 2 weeks ago, the Rules Committee gave us an opportunity to do \\nthings again in the right way by reporting to the Senate a resolution \\nby Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt, the chairman of the Rules \\nCommittee. This resolution, which is similar to the standing order that \\n78 Senators voted for on January 14, 2013, would reduce postcloture \\ndebate time for nominations. Remember, that is after day one, the \\nmajority leader files cloture; day two, nothing happens; day three, we \\nhave a vote on cloture that is by 51 votes, and we would reduce the \\ntime for debate on day three. District judges would be debated for 2 \\nhours, the same as the 2013 standing order that 78 Senators voted for. \\nOther sub-Cabinet positions would be subject to 2 hours of postcloture \\ndebate as well.\\n  The proposal offered by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt would not \\nreduce the postcloture debate time for Supreme Court Justices, for \\nCabinet members, for circuit court or certain Board nominations, like \\nthe National Labor Relations Board, but would divide the 30 hours of \\npostcloture debate equally between Republicans and Democrats.\\n  The Lankford-Blunt proposal would put the Senate back where it has \\nhistorically been on nominations. With rare exceptions, Senate \\nnominations have always been decided by majority vote. Let me say that \\nagain. With rare exceptions, Senate nominations have always been \\ndecided by majority vote.\\n  President Johnson's nomination of Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the \\nSupreme Court was the only example of a Supreme Court nominee who was \\nblocked by requiring more than 51 votes.\\n  There has never been, in the history of the Senate, a Cabinet nominee \\nwho was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes. There has never been, \\nin the history of the Senate, a Federal district judge whose nomination \\nwas blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.\\n  Since 1949, Senate rules have allowed one Senator to insist on a \\ncloture vote; that is, 60 votes, which requires more than a majority to \\nend debate. Even though it was allowed, it just wasn't done. Even the \\nvote on the acrimonious nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme \\nCourt was decided by a majority vote of 52 to 48. Not one Senator tried \\nto block the nomination by requiring 60 votes on a cloture motion, even \\nthough one Senator could have done that.\\n  Only when Democrats began, in 2003, to block President George W. \\nBush's nominees by insisting on a 60-vote cloture vote did that \\ntradition change. Then, in 2017, using the Harry Reid precedent, \\nRepublicans restored the tradition of requiring a majority vote to \\napprove all Presidential nominees, which, as I have said, has been the \\ntradition throughout the history of the Senate.\\n  Also, until recently, with rare exceptions, nominations have been \\nconsidered promptly. After all, there are 1,200 of them, and the Senate \\nhas other things to do besides just being in the personnel business.\\n  For example, last month, I was in Memphis for the investiture of Mark \\nNorris, whose nomination languished for 10 months on the Senate \\ncalendar. The evening before, I had dinner with 94-year-old Harry W. \\nWellford. In November of 1970, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee had \\nrecommended Harry Wellford to serve as a district court judge on the \\nsame court where Mark Norris now serves.\\n  By December 11, 1970, 1 month later, President Nixon had nominated \\nHarry Wellford, and the Senate had confirmed him. All this happened in \\n1 month. Not all nominations have moved that fast. In 1991, a \\nDemocratic Senator, using a secret hold, blocked President George H. W. \\nBush's nomination of me as U.S. Education Secretary. I waited on the \\ncalendar for 6 weeks. Those 6 weeks seemed like an awfully long time to \\nme, and that was for a Cabinet position. It was not 10 months for a \\npart-time position for the Tennessee Valley Authority.\\n  Two weeks ago, I voted to report Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt's \\nresolution to the full Senate, even though no Democrat voted for it. I \\nwill vote for it again on the floor, even if no Democrat will join us. \\nI will also join my fellow Republicans, if we are forced to change the \\nrules by majority vote. I do not like the Harry Reid precedent, but I \\nlike even less the debasement of the Senate's constitutional power to \\nprovide advice and consent to 1,200 Presidential nominees.\\n  My preference is to adopt the Lankford-Blunt resolution, which is \\nvery similar to the 2013 resolution that 78 Senators voted for, and to \\ndo it in a bipartisan way, according to the written Senate rules as we \\ndid in 2013.\\n  I believe most Democrats privately agree that the resolution offered \\nby Senators Lankford and Blunt is reasonable, and they will be grateful \\nthat it is in place when there is a Democratic majority and one \\nRepublican Senator can block a Democratic President's nominees.\\n  The only objection Democrats seem to have to the Lankford-Blunt \\nresolution is that it would apply to President Trump. Their other major \\nobjection, which is truly puzzling, is that the proposed change is \\npermanent, and the change we made in 2013 was temporary. Well, I wonder \\nif Democrats would like it better if we made this change in the Senate \\ntemporary, only applying to the remainder of President Trump's term.\\n  This is my invitation to my Democratic colleagues. Join me and \\nSenators Lankford and Blunt in supporting their resolution, or \\nmodifying it if you believe there is a way to improve it, and working \\nin a bipartisan way, exactly as we did in 2011, 2012, and 2013.\\n  A year or so ago, one of the Supreme Court Justices was asked: How do \\nyou Justices get along so well when you have such different opinions? \\nThis Justice's reply was this: We try to remember that the institution \\nis more important than any of our opinions.\\n  We Senators would do well to emulate the Supreme Court Justices in \\nrespecting and strengthening this institution in which we are \\nprivileged to serve. One way to do that is to join together to restore \\nthe prompt consideration of any President's 1,200 nominees and do it in \\na bipartisan way that shows the American people our written rules mean \\nwhat they say.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1507, text=\"  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to put before the House today H.R. \\n539.\\n  The House passed a nearly identical bill, H.R. 5086, in the 115th \\nCongress and, unfortunately, that is as far as the bill got. Hopefully, \\nwe can get more movement on it this time around, get it through the \\nSenate, and to the President's desk for his signature.\\n  Mr. Speaker, the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act is a bill I \\nintroduced to spur entrepreneurship and turn American innovation into \\nAmerican jobs. This bill expands the National Science Foundation's \\nhighly successful Innovation Corps, or I-Corps program, a program I am \\nproud to have championed since its inception in 2011.\\n  I-Corps teaches scientists and engineers, including many women and \\nunderrepresented minorities, how to turn their federally-funded \\nlaboratory research into successful products and services.\\n  The program has educated more than 1,300 teams, representing 271 \\nuniversities in 47 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. \\nIt has been linked to almost 650 startup companies that have raised \\nalmost $300 million in follow-on funding.\\n  In the 114th Congress, I led the effort that authorized I-Corps and \\nexpanded its reach to other agencies, including the National Institutes \\nof Health, NASA, and the Department of Energy.\\n  The Federal Government invests billions of dollars in research and \\ndevelopment annually, both at government facilities, such as national \\nlabs, and at universities and research institutions. I-Corps is a \\nmodest investment that leads to a higher return on our research \\nspending by significantly increasing rates of commercialization, \\neconomic activity, and job creation.\\n  Our economy is driven by the ingenuity of our scientists and \\nengineers, developing innovations today that become tomorrow's great \\nproducts. And yet, still only a small minority of federally-funded \\nresearch with commercial potential ever makes it to the marketplace. \\nThe I-Corps program helps to change that.\\n  This bill expands I-Corps to meet some pressing needs.\\n  First, it helps more people participate in the program. Right now, \\nunless you are a grantee of NSF or another agency with an I-Corps \\nprogram, the training can be difficult to access. This bill will give \\nrecipients of small business grants from any Federal agency the \\nflexibility to pay for I-Corps with their grant funds, and will also \\nallow other entrepreneurs to apply and pay out-of-pocket to \\nparticipate.\\n  Second, the bill directs NSF to establish a new course as part of the \\nI-Corps program to teach scientist-entrepreneurs how to start and grow \\na company. While the current I-Corps course does a great job of helping \\nscientists and engineers determine who their customers are and whether \\ntheir innovation is suitable for commercialization, it offers only \\nlimited guidance on what to do after a scientist makes the decision to \\nbecome an entrepreneur.\\n  Skills like how to write a business plan, hire a team, and attract \\ninvestment are taught in business schools, but not in Ph.D. programs. \\nNSF recognized this need and has already begun a pilot program to test \\ncurriculum for this new course. This bill will make sure the new course \\nis fully developed and made available around the country.\\n  Finally, this bill requires a GAO assessment of the I-Corps program, \\nits first comprehensive, independent evaluation since it was created. \\nAlthough the program's success to date speaks for itself, it is \\nimportant to continuously improve it by developing metrics to measure \\nits performance and ensure that Federal funds are well spent.\\n  This bill has been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders, \\nincluding the ``father of modern entrepreneurship,'' who developed the \\ncurriculum that I-Corps is based on, Steve Blank; the former NSF \\nprogram officer, who founded the program, Dr. Errol Arkilic; and \\nseveral directors of I-Corps Nodes around the country.\\n  This bill is also endorsed by the Information Technology and \\nInnovation Foundation, the National Venture Capital Association, the \\nAssociation of American Universities; the Council on Governmental \\nRelations; and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.\\n\\n  I thank my cosponsors, Daniel Webster of Florida, Anthony Gonzalez of \\nOhio, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice \\nJohnson of Texas, and Ranking Member Frank Lucas of Oklahoma. I also \\nthank Senators Coons and Young, who are cosponsors of the Senate \\ncompanion to this bill.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that helping our scientists, engineers, and \\nacademics not only advance our knowledge and understanding of the \\nworld, but also create jobs and products that fuel our economy, is a \\ngoal we all can share.\\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve \\nthe balance of my time.\", cat_list={'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Health Care', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",

Madam Speaker, on March 5, 2019, Citizens from across the \\ncountry will gather in our nation's Capital to help raise awareness \\nabout kidney disease and advocate for public policy solutions as part \\nof the National Kidney Foundation's Annual Patient Advocacy Summit. In \\nall my years of service, I have yet to meet more caring and tireless \\nadvocates.\\n  Their advocacy is important because of the number of people kidney \\ndisease affects--nearly one in three adults are at risk of developing \\nkidney disease. Nearly thirty million Americans have kidney disease and \\napproximately ninety percent don't even know it. It sneaks up on you \\nand that's why raising awareness is a key component to combating this \\ndisease and ultimately saving lives.\\n  Sadly, on October 10, 2018, we lost one of our great advocates and \\nchampions--our friend Bill Hahn of Rockledge, Florida, passed away. \\nBill was one of those unspoken heroes who got up every morning and \\nfought to keep going, for himself, and so many other people struggling \\nwith kidney disease, recovering from transplant surgery and waiting to \\nreceive the special gift of life.\\n  From an early age, Bill believed in physical fitness and leading a \\nvery active and healthy life. As a young man he was a male model and \\nlater a professional surfer with the famous Salick surf team winning \\nnumerous awards. A graduate of Florida State University, he owned and \\noperated a successful health fitness business selling exercise \\nequipment in Melbourne, Florida. Even with his dedication to a daily \\nexercise regiment, at the age of twenty-six, Bill was diagnosed with \\nType 1 Diabetes.\\n  Living with Diabetes can be a difficult struggle, even for someone as \\nphysically fit as Bill Hahn. Over time the disease began to take a toll \\non Bill's health as he suffered from many of its complications \\nincluding blindness, nerve damage and even coma. Unfortunately, Bill \\nsuffered renal failure at age fifty-one, but his physical routine never \\nstopped. When Bill was on dialysis, he was walking ten miles a day. And \\nbecause of his fitness level, he was a good candidate for transplant \\nsurgery. On New Year's Eve 2008, Bill received a true gift of life--a \\nnew kidney and pancreas.\\n  Since his surgery, Bill dedicated his life to helping patients \\nstruggling with kidney disease and other serious medical conditions. In \\n2012 he joined with surfing legend and fellow transplant recipient Rich \\nSalick and co-founded the annual Cocoa Beach ``Footprints in the Sand'' \\nKidney Walk. Katie and I have been involved in the Kidney Walk each \\nyear and it continues to grow and draw participation from all over \\nCentral Florida thanks in large part to Bill's work and other \\nvolunteers from our community.\\n  Bill was a constant advocate for this cause, especially in the last \\nyears of his life. And, if you knew Bill Hahn, helping others is what\\n\\n\\nkept him going. He worked closely with my office on various projects \\nthroughout the years and brought to my attention many important pieces \\nof legislation moving through Congress that are critical to winning \\nthis battle. In 2017 Bill lead a successful effort to declare May 13th \\n``Living Kidney Donor Day'' in the State of Florida. He is also the \\nauthor of three books including More Than A Conqueror Legacy, a \\nspiritual healing guide for patients; The Silver Lining, a chronicle of \\nBill's journey through recovery; and The Window Box, a book of poetry.\\n  I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me \\nin recognizing the efforts of Bill Hahn and the many other Americans \\nwho have worked tirelessly to raise awareness about kidney disease and \\nadvocate for patients in need.\\n\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Education'})\n",

If we could fix this, we would stop \\nbeing held back by the shortage of workforce that we face, and, most \\nimportantly, our families would not be held back by lower paychecks.\\n  But these new jobs in cybersecurity, in medical technology, in \\nadvanced manufacturing, they are hard jobs and they require training.\\n\\n\\n  We need to make the training available to people where they live at a \\ncost that they can actually afford. We have no time to waste.\\n  Our businesses are competing on a global stage against countries that \\nwill use the full machinery of their governments to make sure their \\nworkforces are ready.

Officer Spernak was nationally recognized by Mothers Against \\nDrunk Driving (MADD) in 1990 for creating a drunk driving education \\nprogram for teens, which is still used today.

Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this \\nweek the Senate will resume our work in the personnel business by \\nconsidering yet another of President Trump's qualified judicial \\nnominees.\\n  Eric Miller has been chosen to sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of \\nAppeals, and one look at his legal career to this point says he is well \\nprepared to do so.\\n  Mr. Miller is a graduate of Harvard and the University of Chicago, \\nwhere he served on the Law Review editorial staff. He has held \\nprominent clerkships on both the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and the \\nU.S. Supreme Court. His record of public service at the Justice \\nDepartment and in private practice reflects a legal mind of the highest \\ncaliber.\\n  I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance the \\nfirst circuit court nominee of this new Congress. That will be 31 since \\nPresident Trump took office. But first, in just a few hours, the Senate \\nwill vote on advancing a straightforward piece of legislation to \\nprotect newborn babies. This legislation is simple. It would simply \\nrequire that medical professionals give the same standard of care and \\nmedical treatment to newborn babies who have survived an attempted \\nabortion as any other newborn baby would receive in any other \\ncircumstance. It isn't about new restrictions on abortion. It isn't \\nabout changing the options available to women. It is just about \\nrecognizing that a newborn baby is a newborn baby, period.\\n  This bill would make clear that in the year 2019, in the United \\nStates of America, medical professionals on hand when a baby is born \\nalive need to maintain their basic ethical and professional \\nresponsibilities to that newborn. It would make sure our laws reflect \\nthe fact that the human rights of newborn boys and girls are innate; \\nthey don't come and go based on the circumstances of birth. Whatever \\nthe circumstances, if that medical professional comes face-to-face with \\na baby who has been born alive, they are looking at a human being with \\nhuman rights, period.\\n  To be frank, it makes me uneasy that such a basic statement seems to \\nbe generating actual disagreement. Can the extreme, far-left politics \\nsurrounding abortion really have come this far? Are we really supposed \\nto think that it is normal that there are now two sides debating \\nwhether newborn, living babies deserve medical attention?\\n  We already know that many of our Democratic colleagues want the \\nUnited States to remain one of seven nations in the world that permit \\nelective abortions after 20 weeks--seven countries, including North \\nKorea, China, and the United States of America. But now it seems the \\nfar left wants to push the envelope even further. Apart from the entire \\nabortion debate, they now seem to be suggesting that newborn babies' \\nright to life may be contingent--contingent--on the circumstances \\nsurrounding their birth. Well, evidently, the far left is no longer \\nconvinced that all babies are created equal, but the rest of us are \\nstill pretty fond of that principle.\\n  My colleagues across the aisle need to decide where they will take \\ntheir cues on these moral questions. On the one hand, there are a few \\nextreme voices who have decided that some newborn lives are more \\ndisposable than others. On the other side is the entire rest of the \\ncountry.\\n  I would urge my colleagues: Let's listen to the voices of the \\nAmerican people. Let's reaffirm that when we say every life is created \\nequal, we actually mean it. Let's vote to advance the Born-Alive \\nAbortion Survivors Protection Act later today.\\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",

      "Pandas(Index=1583, text=\"  Mr. SASSE. Madam President, I just listened to the senior Senator \\nfrom New York--my friend from the gym and the minority leader--deliver \\nsome summaries of what he said was in the bill before us, and he \\nimplored this body and implored the people watching on C-SPAN to read \\nthe bill, stating they would find that all of these terrible things are \\nin the bill.\\n  I see the minority leader has to leave the floor now, but, humbly, I \\nwould urge him to come back and show us where any of what he just said \\nis in this bill. What he said wasn't true.\\n  I rise today for a simple purpose. I want to ask each and every one \\nof our colleagues whether we are OK with infanticide. This language is \\nblunt. I recognize that, and it is too blunt for many people in this \\nbody, but, frankly, that is what we are talking about here today.\\n  Infanticide is what the abortion survivors--Born-Alive Abortion \\nSurvivors Protection Act is actually about.\\n  Are we a country that protects babies who are alive, born outside the \\nwomb after having survived a botched abortion? That is what this is \\nabout.\\n  Are we a country that says it is OK to actively allow that baby to \\ndie, which is the current position of Federal law? That is the question \\nbefore us, plain and simple.\\n  Here are the facts. We know that some babies, especially late in \\ngestation, survive attempted abortions. We know, too, that some of \\nthese babies are left to die--left to die. No further protections exist \\ntoday to shield them from this ugly fate, and only some States have \\nprotections on their books. We have seen in our national discourse over \\nthe last month and a half a few States moving in different ways to undo \\nprotections that some of these babies have had at the State level.\\n  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is trying to right \\nthis obvious wrong. The bill's terms are simple: A child born alive \\nduring a botched abortion would be given the same level of care that \\nwould be provided to any other baby born at that same gestational age. \\nThat is it.\\n  This bill isn't about abortion. I am pro-life--unapologetically pro-\\nlife--but this bill is not about anything that limits abortion. This \\nbill doesn't have anything to do with Roe v. Wade. This bill is about \\nsomething else. What this bill does is try to secure basic rights, \\nequal rights for babies who are born and are outside the womb. That is \\nwhat we are talking about.\\n  Over the course of the next hour, as this is debated on the floor, \\npeople are going to say a whole bunch of other things. I would ask them \\nto please bring the text of the bill to the floor when they do it and \\nshow us whether there is anything about limiting abortion in this bill.\\n  This bill is exclusively about protecting babies who have already \\nbeen born and are outside of the womb. Every baby deserves a fighting \\nchance, whether that 24-week old baby, fighting for air and fighting \\nfor life, having just taken her first breaths, is at an abortion clinic \\nwhere she survived a botched abortion or she is in a delivery room at \\nthe local hospital. Both of those babies are equally deserving of care, \\nprotection, and humane treatment, and our laws should treat both of \\nthese human beings as babies because they are babies. They have been \\nborn, and they are outside of the womb.\\n\\n\\n  This really should not be controversial. In fact, my colleagues \\nactually talk this way all of the time. This place feels like about \\none-third of the people here are currently running for President, so I \\nwould like to quote a few of them over the course of the last couple \\nmonths.\\n  We ought to ``build a country where no one is forgotten, and no one \\nis left behind.'' Amen to that. Amen to that.\\n\\n  ``The people in our society who are most often targeted by predators \\nare also often the voiceless and the vulnerable.''\\n  That is true.\\n  Another offered a promise to ``fight for other people's kids as hard \\nas I fight for my own kids.''\\n  Last week, our colleague from Vermont announced his campaign by \\nsaying: ``The mark of a great Nation is . . . how it treats its most \\nvulnerable people.'' Bernie Sanders was right.\\n  Now is the chance, in this body, to make good on that promise. Now is \\nthe chance to protect one of the most vulnerable populations on the \\nland imaginable--tiny, defenseless, little babies, just having taken \\ntheir first breath--or was that claptrap for the campaign trail or \\nsound-bites? Or do people mean the stuff they say around here?\\n  Let's put it another way. Today's vote asks whether or not you want \\nto take the side of people like Virginia's disgraced Governor Ralph \\nNortham?\\n  Last month, before the news of his hideous yearbook broke, Governor \\nNortham made clear that a baby born alive during an abortion could and \\nmaybe ought to be killed if that is what the parents and doctors \\ndecided they wanted to do after a debate. That was his position: You \\nshould make the baby ``comfortable,'' and then there could be a \\ndiscussion about whether or not you throw that little baby into the \\ntrash can. That is what he actually talked about on the radio for a day \\nand a half last month.\\n  Governor Northam is disgraceful for a whole host of reasons, but \\nunlike some other people, he actually told the truth about what he \\nwants. He wants a society where some people count more than others, and \\nother people are worth less than others. He wants a society where some \\npeople can be pushed aside if they are inconvenient. In reality, that \\nis what we are voting on today.\\n  Some of my colleagues want to write into our law a kind of permanent \\nexception: ``Every human being should be protected from cruel and \\ninhuman treatment--unless that human being came into the world through \\na botched abortion.'' Then, you can decide later if you want to kill \\nthem.\\n  Tonight, what we are going to vote on in the Born-Alive Abortion \\nSurvivors Protection Act is a chance to see whether we are serious when \\npeople around here say they want to protect the innocent, speak up for \\nthe voiceless, and defend the defenseless. Tonight, we are going to \\nhave the opportunity to do exactly that. We can come to the aid of \\ninnocent, voiceless, defenseless little babies who have just taken \\ntheir first breaths by protecting him and her from mistreatment and \\nneglect.\\n  This should be, frankly, the easiest vote we ever cast in this body, \\nbut the prospect of what we are voting on here is threatening to one of \\nthe most powerful interest groups in America. The abortion industry has \\ntaken to attacking this bill wildly over the course of the last 2 \\nweeks, even though, as we made clear repeatedly and as the text of this \\nbill makes indisputably clear, this bill has nothing to do with \\nabortion itself. Nothing in this bill changes the slightest letter of \\nRoe v. Wade. Nothing touches abortion access in this bill.\\n  This bill is about living and breathing babies who are alive outside \\nthe womb. That is all that the text of this bill does, but Planned \\nParenthood and NARAL and their allies feel threatened by a bill to \\nprotect alive, out-of-the-womb babies. In other words, unlike this \\nlegislation, Planned Parenthood and others refuse to draw any line \\nbetween abortion and infanticide. That is what their lobbying the last \\nweek has shown. That should tell us something about what these groups \\nare really about. What they are about is a society built on power--the \\npower of some people to decide whether other people get to live or die.\\n  This bill is a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that some lives \\nare less valuable than others. This bill is a stumbling block to anyone \\nwho thinks that certain human beings should be disposable. This bill is \\na stumbling block to anyone who thinks that we should be able to \\nquietly rid ourselves of little people who were ``inconvenient'' or \\nsupposedly ``unwanted.''\\n  They are not unwanted. There are lots of people in every single State \\nin this Union lined up waiting to adopt, including kids who have lots \\nof hard life circumstances. In every State there are waiting lists of \\npeople who will take so-called unwanted babies.\\n  America is a country built on a different principle. Ours is a \\ncountry dedicated to the proposition that all men and women--all boys \\nand girls--are created equal, even the littlest--even if they happen to \\ncome into the world under the most horrible circumstances, even if they \\nare crippled or inconvenient, or, apparently, for a moment, unwanted. \\nOurs is a country that recognizes the fundamental indistinguishable \\ndignity of every human being, regardless of race, or sex, or creed, or \\nability. As a country, we have struggled for 2 centuries--sometimes at \\nenormous cost--to extend those basic human rights to more and more of \\nour fellow citizens. Today's vote is simply an opportunity to continue \\nthat work.\\n  Let me say by way of closing that despite oppositions and setbacks \\nand despite some strange rhetoric about this bill over the course of \\nthe last week, I am hopeful in the long term. Deep down, each of us \\nknows that every member of our human family ought to be protected and \\ndeserves to be cherished and loved. The love we see every day in the \\neyes of moms and dads for their newborn babies is an inescapable \\nreminder of that fundamental truth. Love is stronger than power.\\n  Thank you, Madam President.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",

Sometimes it has been one individual, \\nand sometimes it has been more than one, but today we have five \\nhonorees.\\n  While these innovators hail from different backgrounds and have each \\nmastered a different craft, they share one thing in common, and that is \\na commitment to their communities and to improving the lives of others \\nin groundbreaking ways.\\n  Today, we will honor the individual work of the following people. I \\nwill list them for you first and then talk about each of them in \\nsuccession: first, the Reverend Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake; second, Joan \\nMyers Brown; third, Sulaiman Rahman; fourth, Rakia Reynolds; and fifth, \\nOmar Woodward. You will hear more about each of them in a moment. There \\nis no one way, of course, to make a difference in our society. I hope \\nthe stories of today's honorees will help to inspire the next \\ngeneration of leaders. These honorees are with us here in Washington \\ntoday, and we are grateful to have the chance to spend a couple of \\nminutes talking about each of them.\\n  Let me start with the Reverend Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake, someone I \\nhave known for a long time. This is the story of a woman who has spent \\nher life working to build healthier communities by advancing the \\nconversation on issues like the opioid crisis and health disparities in \\nour Nation, just to mention two things.\\n  Lorina Marshall-Blake's life began in West Philadelphia, alongside \\nher sister and three brothers. She excelled in her education, earning \\ndegrees from Antioch College and the University of Pennsylvania.\\n  Today, Lorina is vice president of community affairs for Independence \\nBlue Cross and also president of the Independence Blue Cross \\nFoundation. Lorina has spent the better part of 30 years working to \\nimprove access and healthcare outcomes for those across\\n\\n\\nthe region of Southeastern Pennsylvania, which is Philadelphia and the \\ncounties and communities around the city of Philadelphia. Her faith-\\ndriven work continues outside of the office, where she serves as an \\nassociate minister at the Vine Memorial Baptist Church.\\n  Lorina is affiliated with over 30 professional and civic \\norganizations. I will just mention a few: The United Negro College \\nFund, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, and the Urban \\nAffairs Coalition. While the health and well-being of our Nation is not \\nperfect, it is in great part thanks to women like Lorina Marshall-Blake \\nthat the future of healthcare and the future of access to healthcare is \\nonly brighter.\\n  The second individual we are honoring is Joan Myers Brown. We all \\nknow that art itself has the power to enrich lives and inspire change. \\nAt the age of 17, Joan Myers Brown decided she was going to be a \\nprofessional ballerina. She refused to let pervasive racism and \\nsegregation stop her from touring as a member of dance revues for Cab \\nCalloway, Pearl Bailey, and Sammy Davis, Jr.\\n  After excelling in her own right, she decided she wanted to give \\nopportunity to others. To that end, in 1960, Joan Myers Brown started \\nher own dance school in West Philadelphia called the Philadelphia \\nSchool of Dance Arts. Building on that work, she founded the \\nPhiladelphia Dance Company in 1970. This dance company was created to \\nprovide opportunities for Black dancers who were systemically denied \\nentrance to local schools. The company continues to be recognized \\nacross the world for its dancers and for its performances.\\n  Personally, Joan is an industry icon in both the national and \\ninternational art communities. For example, in 2005, the Kennedy Center \\nhonored her as a master of African-American choreography, and in 2009, \\nshe received the prestigious Philadelphia Award. In 2012, she received \\nthe National Medal of the Arts, the Nation's highest civic honor for \\nexcellence in the arts. The arts have benefited greatly from Joan Myers \\nBrown.\\n  Third is Sulaiman Rahman. No individual's success is achieved alone. \\nWe know that, and many in Philadelphia and beyond owe some of their \\nsuccess to Mr. Rahman. He has dedicated his life to empowering young \\nprofessionals to personal and professional success.\\n  After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Sulaiman \\nstarted his career as an entrepreneur. He founded a platform for urban \\nprofessionals to find local social, civic, and business events, and he \\nsuccessfully built an international marketing and distributing \\nbusiness.\\n  With the goal of ending the opportunity gap for people of color, \\nSulaiman created the Urban Philly Professional Network and, later, \\nDiverseForce, and the DiverseForce on Boards program. Every day he \\nworks to empower and connect the diverse leaders from multiple sectors \\nand communities. He creates high-tech solutions to impact a more \\ndiverse business culture.\\n  When he is not running DiverseForce, he is serving on a number of \\nboards, including the Community College of Philadelphia Foundation, \\nTeenSHARP, and the Year Up Greater Philadelphia Chapter.\\n  Rakia Reynolds. We know that some of our Nation's greatest successes \\nhave been born out of interdisciplinary collaboration. Few in the \\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania know how to bring people together for new \\nopportunities like Rakia Reynolds. From her earliest days as a child \\nreading the book ``A Wrinkle in Time,'' she has always been committed \\nto making things happen.\\n  She is a New Jersey native. She moved to Philadelphia to pursue a \\ndegree at Temple University. After working as a television and magazine \\nproducer, she started her own company, Skai Blue Media.\\n  Among other ventures, she helped to craft Philadelphia's Amazon bid \\nand continues to advise and grow small businesses of all types. She \\ngives back to her community as the copresident of the Philadelphia \\nchapter of Women in Film & Television and serves as a board advisor for \\nFashion Group International and the National Association for Multi-\\nEthnicity in Communications.\\n  In addition to her full-time work in multimedia communications, Rakia \\nis a wife to her best friend, her husband Bram, and mother to her three \\namazing children.\\n  Finally, our fifth honoree is Omar Woodward. Like many of today's \\nsuccessful leaders, Omar Woodward understands the importance of social \\nenterprises and knows how to look beyond what meets the eye.\\n  Omar is a Southeastern Pennsylvania native. He is the executive \\ndirector of the Philadelphia branch of the GreenLight Fund, a nonprofit \\nventure capital firm that invests in evidence-based social innovations \\nfocused on ending poverty.\\n  At the GreenLight Fund, Omar is investing millions of dollars to \\naddress the needs of many Philadelphians, including bringing formerly \\nincarcerated individuals back into the job market, helping low-income \\nchildren receive quality care, and ensuring that those who were \\neligible have access to public assistance programs.\\n  Widely recognized for his expertise in nonprofit board governance, \\nOmar is also a board member of the Philanthropy Network Greater \\nPhiladelphia, the Global Philadelphia Association, the Maternity Care \\nCoalition, and the Girard College Foundation, and he holds multiple \\ndegrees from George Washington University.\\n  In closing, these five individuals have overcome significant barriers \\nto become pioneers in their fields and leaders in their communities. \\nThroughout their careers, these innovators have recognized gaps within \\ncommunities, developed creative ideas, and brought these ideas to life \\nby using their determination, their passion, and their talent. We \\ncelebrate Black History Month to commemorate the great leaders of the \\npast but also to celebrate the leaders of today and the leaders of \\ntomorrow--the future.\\n  It is my honor to recognize and to pay tribute to the Rev. Dr. Lorina \\nMarshall-Blake, Joan Myers Brown, Sulaiman Rahman, Rakia Reynolds, and \\nOmar Woodard for their work in creating a stronger, more innovative \\nPhiladelphia. I look forward to the work these leaders will continue to \\ndo and the impact their work will have on the city of Philadelphia, our \\nCommonwealth, and our Nation.\\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Welfare & Poverty', 'Health Care', 'Technology', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1589, text=\"  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to voice my full support for \\nthe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, offered by my \\ncolleague from Nebraska.\\n  Today's vote on this important bill is going to give every Member of \\nthe Senate a chance to show America where one stands on the basic right \\nof care for newborn babies.\\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong \\nsupporter of pro-life policies that show compassion to women and \\nchildren. During my time in the Nebraska Legislature, we passed the \\nfirst statewide ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks. Members from \\nall points of the political spectrum--Republican, Democratic, pro-life, \\nand pro-choice--came together to support that bill. We have the \\nopportunity today to come together--Republicans and Democrats--to stand \\nup for the lives of newborn infants in the U.S. Senate.\\n  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act protects the lives \\nof children who survive attempted abortions. Simply put, if a baby \\nsurvives an abortion, he or she deserves the same medical care as any \\nother child who is born prematurely. Without question, newborns deserve \\ncare, attention, and love. This should not be a divisive issue. This is \\nan issue that is fundamental to what it means to be an American citizen \\nand, more so, what it means to be a human being. Our Founding Fathers \\nbelieved, unequivocally, that every person born in the United States \\nhas a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Born-\\nAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be, without any doubt, a \\nmeasure that is passed in the Senate.\\n  Like most Nebraskans, I have been deeply disturbed by the actions in \\nVirginia, New York, and the new extremes that have been pushed in the \\nensuing national debate that it is OK to deny newborn abortion \\nsurvivors medical\\n\\n\\ncare. As we all know, a bill was introduced in the Virginia House of \\nDelegates that would make it easier to get a third-term abortion. When \\ndiscussing this legislation, the Governor of Virginia recently made \\nextremely disturbing comments in defending the bill and promoting \\ninfanticide when he described the process of an abortion procedure \\ntaking place while a mother was in labor. These policies and lines of \\nthought fly in the face of our core values, and they have to end.\\n  In leading up to the vote today, critics across the aisle have \\nmounted a campaign of misinformation to try to knock this bill off \\ncourse. To be clear, this legislation does not set any limits on the \\nrights of one to obtain an abortion or abortion procedures or methods. \\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would ensure that if \\nnewborns survive abortions, then they would receive the same care and \\nthe same attention to their health as would any other newborn. Newborn \\nchildren should never be treated without basic human rights or the full \\nprotection of our laws because they are not wanted, especially when \\nreports have estimated that nearly 2 million couples in the United \\nStates are currently waiting to adopt children--2 million.\\n  There is simply no excuse for an infant not to receive lifesaving \\ncare. We live in a nation that was founded upon the basic rights of \\ndignity, self-worth, and equality for every human being. In 2002, the \\nBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act passed the House of Representatives \\nby a voice vote; it passed the Senate by unanimous consent; and it was \\nsigned into law by President Bush. We have the chance right now to \\nbuild upon that 2002 consensus that those who survive abortions are, in \\nfact, people and to clarify that they deserve medical care. We can come \\ntogether today to support this sound policy once more. We can clarify, \\nin light of the extremism we have seen displayed recently, that newborn \\nabortion survivors deserve medical care.\\n  I thank my fellow Nebraskan for his good work on this bill, and I \\nwill be voting to affirm that children deserve protection at every \\nstage of life.\\n  I ask all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this measure and \\nto vote in favor of this important bill that is before us.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion', 'Crime & Drugs'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1591, text=\"  Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I rise to join Senator Murray and my \\ncolleagues in standing up for doctors and patients in my home State of \\nMinnesota and across the country.\\n  S. 311 puts Congress in the middle of the important medical decisions \\nthat patients and doctors should make together without having political \\ninterference. It would compel physicians to provide unnecessary medical \\ncare. It would override physicians' professional judgments about what \\nis best for their patients, and it would put physicians in the position \\nof facing criminal penalties if their judgments about what is best for \\ntheir patients are contrary to what is described in this bill.\\n  Colleagues, let me be clear. For women, this is a healthcare issue, \\nnot a political issue, and this bill, I fear, interferes with the \\ndoctor-patient relationship, which should worry us all. We can all \\nagree that people deserve the best medical care based on their \\nindividual needs and their doctors' best medical advice. This is how \\nour medical system is supposed to work--physicians and patients making \\ndecisions together that are based on patients' individual needs.\\n  Everybody is different. For example, any oncologist will tell you \\nthat each cancer patient's treatment is different. Treatment plans \\ndepend on the type of cancer and how advanced the cancer is. Decisions \\nabout cancer treatments also depend on each person's age and lifestyle \\nand individual circumstances. The same is true when it comes to \\npregnancy. Any obstetrician will tell you that every pregnancy is \\ndifferent and that when complications arise, they can completely change \\nthe course of treatment. In that moment, women and their families and \\ntheir doctors are the only ones who are able to make decisions about \\nwhat is best for a woman and her pregnancy.\\n  Think about what this means in real life. In August of 2016, Tippy, \\nwho is from Minnesota and has agreed for me to share her story, was \\npregnant and, with her husband, went to their 20-week ultrasound \\nappointment. They were excited because they thought they were about to \\nfind out the gender of their new baby, and they had already bought \\ndecorations for the gender reveal party. Instead, Tippy and her husband \\ngot devastating news from that ultrasound. Their baby, a boy, had \\nstopped developing properly and would not survive. They would never get \\nto meet him and never get to hold him. The ultrasound revealed not only \\nthe tragic news about this much wanted child but also showed a \\ndangerous condition that threatened Tippy's own health. Tippy's \\nplacenta was enlarged, and to continue her pregnancy would risk the \\nhealth of her reproductive system and her ability to have future \\nchildren of her own.\\n  Tippy, with her family and her doctor, made the difficult decision to \\nhave an abortion in order to save her reproductive system. Because she \\nwas able to make that medical decision, she was able to have another \\nbaby a year later. Tippy and her husband are today the proud parents of \\nan 18-month-old child. When Tippy and her husband made their decision, \\nit was based on guidance from her doctor and what was right for them \\nand the family they hoped to have in the future.\\n  They didn't need politicians to be looking over their shoulders in \\nthe doctor's office and telling them what to do. None of us in this \\nbody should be in the business of interfering in that doctor-patient \\nrelationship. We don't tell oncologists how to treat their patients; we \\ndon't tell emergency room doctors how to save lives; and we shouldn't \\ntell women's doctors how to take care of their patients.\\n  Colleagues, that is what this bill does. It would give politicians in \\nthis room the power to make medical decisions for women and their \\nfamilies. This bill intimidates providers and forces physicians to \\nprovide inappropriate medical treatment even when it is not in the best \\ninterests of their patients or their families.\\n  Colleagues, we should treat women with respect. Decisions about \\nwomen's healthcare aren't different from decisions about men's \\nhealthcare, so why are we treating women differently? This legislation, \\nif it were to become law, would put doctors in an untenable position: \\nDo they follow the law or do they follow their code of professional \\nethics?\\n  Colleagues, let's get out of the business of dictating medical care \\nfor women. Let's continue to trust women and their doctors. I urge my \\ncolleagues to oppose this legislation.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1593, text=\"  Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, this evening, as we debate this very \\nimportant bill, I am hearing two different strategies, two different \\ndiscussions, about what is actually on the floor in front of us. You \\nsee, my colleagues across the aisle are debating a bill that is not in \\nfront of us. They are talking about healthcare for women, which is \\nabortion. That is what they are talking about.\\n  This bill does not address abortion. It does not address women's \\nhealthcare issues. What this bill does is address the healthcare of a \\nbaby who is born alive after a botched abortion. We are not talking \\nabout abortion, folks. We are talking about the life of a child who is \\nborn. So, while my colleagues across the aisle are saying this is about \\nabortion, that this is about a mother's healthcare, that is absolutely \\nincorrect. We are talking about a human life.\\n  In recent weeks, we have witnessed the ugly truth about the far-\\nreaching grasp of the abortion industry and its ever-increasingly \\nradicalized political agenda. Some politicians have not only defended \\naborting a child while a woman is in labor but have gone so far as to \\nsupport the termination of a child after his birth. This assault on \\nhuman dignity cannot stand. We can and must do better, and we can as a \\nnation do better to defend and uphold the basic values of compassion \\nand decency that define our very society.\\n  I thank the junior Senator from Nebraska for offering this \\ncommonsense legislation that addresses this issue in a compassionate \\nmanner and provides critical protections for children who are born \\nalive after surviving abortions.\\n\\n\\n  Although previous laws were passed that recognize infants born alive \\nduring abortion proceedings as legal persons, there still exists a \\ncritical loophole that prevents abortionists from being held \\naccountable for failing to follow these very laws.\\n  This legislation closes the gap and ensures that there are concrete \\nenforcement measures to protect children who survive abortion attempts.\\n  We can all agree that any child who is born alive, whether through a \\nnatural birth or a botched abortion, is a living person, a person who \\nis worthy of the utmost dignity, compassion, and respect. This \\nlegislation ensures just that by simply requiring healthcare \\npractitioners to treat those babies who survive an abortion attempt \\nwith the same degree of care any other baby born at the same \\ngestational age would receive.\\n  This legislation is not meant to punish women or mothers during an \\noften heart-wrenching and difficult experience. In fact, this \\nlegislation specifically prohibits mothers from being prosecuted. \\nInstead, this bill quite simply imposes penalties for the intentional \\nkilling of a baby who has been born alive.\\n  Today, we have an opportunity to categorically reject infanticide by \\nensuring that the laws we have on the books preventing this abhorrent \\npractice are meaningfully enforced and that those who fail to follow \\nsuch laws can be held accountable.\\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside partisanship and support this much \\nneeded, compassionate solution. We as a nation can do better. We must \\nprotect those babies who are born alive.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1595, text=\"  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \\nlegislation that the Presiding Officer has authored. It would \\nsignificantly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, and it \\nwould pose new obstacles to a woman's constitutionally protected right \\nto make her own decisions about her reproductive health.\\n  Regardless of what the intent of the legislation is, the fact is, the \\nway it is written, it intimidates doctors with the threat of criminal \\nliability for performing safe and legal abortions. It will have a \\nchilling effect on the ability of women to access the services they \\nneed in the United States.\\n  We must always remember that abortions that are performed later in \\npregnancy are most often done as the result of severe fetal diagnoses \\nand the serious risks that pregnancy poses to the life of the mother.\\n  And let's be very clear: This isn't a decision that any women or \\nfamily wants to be in a position to make. It is tragic and it is \\nheartbreaking, and efforts to politicize the trauma of women and \\nfamilies who have been forced to make this decision are really \\nshameful, and it sets a dangerous precedent for women's comprehensive \\nhealthcare.\\n  By installing new uncertainty and risk of criminal liability into the \\nprocess for late-term abortions, this legislation increases the risk \\nthat women will not be able to get the medical care they need when \\ntheir pregnancy poses a risk to their lives. This bill ignores those \\nimportant realities in what appears to be an attempt to score political \\npoints with anti-choice groups.\\n  Again and again, at every turn, we have seen this administration and \\nour Republican colleagues push forward policies intended to threaten \\naccess to abortion care. Just last week, the Trump administration cut \\noff critical family planning resources for family planning clinics that \\noffer information and referrals for women seeking to obtain legal \\nabortions. If you want to prevent abortions, you want to make sure \\nfamilies have access to family planning. We know that is an important \\nway to reduce the number of abortions in this country.\\n  So we are seeing that this bill is just another line of attack in the \\nongoing war on women's health. Now more than ever, we need to stand up \\nand help protect women's healthcare and make certain that abortions \\nremain safe and legal.\\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and its consideration \\non the Senate floor.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1597, text=\"  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I would like to first thank Senator Murray \\nfor her steadfast leadership in the fight to protect women's healthcare \\nand for arranging this time for us to speak this afternoon.\\n  The legislation we are debating today is just the latest salvo in the \\nfar-right wing assault on a woman's constitutionally protected right to \\nan abortion.\\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Nebraska who introduced \\nthis legislation, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. \\nContrary to what the proponents of this bill argue, it is and has \\nalways been a crime to harm or kill newborn babies. People guilty of \\nthis crime can already be charged and prosecuted to the full extent of \\nthe law.\\n  Let's be clear. The Senate isn't debating this legislation today \\nbecause there is an epidemic of infanticide in this country. There is \\nnot one. There isn't one. I can hardly say it because it is really not \\nhappening; therefore, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. \\nInstead, we are indulging the majority's use of a false premise to \\ninflame the public, shame women, and intimidate healthcare providers.\\n  When you strip away the ultraconservative rhetoric, you are left with \\na very simple argument from supporters of this legislation--that the \\nmoral judgment of rightwing politicians in Washington, DC, should \\nsupersede a medical professional's judgment and a woman's decision. \\nConservative politicians should not be telling doctors how they should \\ncare for their patients. Instead, women, in consultation with their \\nfamilies and doctors, are in the best position to determine their best \\ncourse of care.\\n  In talking to healthcare providers in Hawaii, I have heard how this \\nlegislation and other bills like it in States across the country could \\nforce them to provide care that is unnecessary or even harmful to \\npatients. The Hawaii Section of the College of Obstetricians and \\nGynecologists made this point persuasively in testimony recently \\nsubmitted to our State legislature's house committee on health earlier \\nthis month. In opposing similar so-called born-alive abortion \\nlegislation heard in Hawaii's State Legislature--which didn't make it \\nout of committee, by the way--the group of doctors wrote:\\n\\n       We are physicians who provide compassionate, evidence-based \\n     care. By criminalizing healthcare providers, this law may \\n     actually reduce the number of healthcare providers (not just \\n     the surgeons, but anesthesiologists, nurses, midwives, office \\n     staff) willing to provide this care. But again, that is the \\n     actual intent of this bill. Reducing access to safe abortion \\n     care would threaten the health of women in Hawaii.\\n       We are the physicians who care for patients when they find \\n     out their very wanted, very loved baby has severe fetal \\n     anomalies. Families sometimes choose to end the pregnancy and \\n     provide their baby with palliative care rather than subject \\n     their baby to any suffering or futile efforts at \\n     resuscitation. These families face very difficult decisions \\n     about what their values are and what is best for their \\n     family; decisions that none of us has a right to make for \\n     them or judge them for. What they need in these moments is \\n     compassion and medically accurate information from healthcare \\n     providers free of judgment or politics.\\n\\n  I couldn't agree more, and that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose \\nthis legislation.\\n  In just a few minutes, I expect the Senate will defeat this bill \\nbecause it will fail to win the required 60 votes. Nevertheless, the \\nthreat to women's reproductive rights is intensifying in States and \\ncourtrooms all across the country. Over the past few years, States have \\nenacted hundreds--hundreds--of laws that harm women's health and \\nviolate their constitutional right to an abortion.\\n  Mississippi enacted a prohibition on abortion after 15 weeks of \\npregnancy.\\n  Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Ohio have passed laws banning \\ndilation and evacuation--D&E--an abortion procedure used usually during \\nthe second trimester.\\n  Indiana enacted a bevy of new abortion restrictions, including a law \\nrequiring every woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound--talk \\nabout invasive--and mandated she wait 18 hours after the ultrasound to \\nhave an abortion.\\n  Louisiana passed legislation requiring abortion providers to have \\nadmitting privileges at local hospitals. This law would result in only \\none abortion provider in a State of 4.7 million people.\\n  Advocates have recognized the harm these laws would have on women and\\n\\n\\nhave filed suits to block their implementation. Several lower courts \\nhave ruled these restrictions unconstitutional, and the cases are \\nmoving steadily through the courts of appeals en route to the Supreme \\nCourt.\\n  The Fifth Circuit, for example, will hear an appeal of a lower \\ncourt's decision to block Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, as well \\nas an appeal from Texas to allow its ban on D&E procedures to go into \\neffect.\\n  The Seventh Circuit upheld a lower court ruling striking down parts \\nof Indiana's mandatory ultrasound and waiting period law. The Indiana \\nattorney general has requested the Supreme Court to review this case.\\n  The Supreme Court temporarily stopped Louisiana's so-called admitting \\nprivileges law from taking effect on a 5-to-4 vote. This is the law I \\ntalked about before. This law would result in one abortion provider in \\na State of 4.7 million people.\\n  The Fifth Circuit will now hear an appeal on the merits of the law, \\nwhich is virtually identical to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck \\ndown in 2016--that was only a few short years ago--in the landmark \\nWhole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt decision.\\n  The stakes in these court battles and the more than 20 other \\nabortion-related cases making their way through the Federal court are \\nincredibly high. Any one of them would provide the opening for the U.S. \\nSupreme Court to finally fulfill the rightwing goal of overturning Roe \\nv. Wade.\\n  It is with this central goal in mind that Donald Trump, Majority \\nLeader McConnell, and complicit Republicans of Congress have been \\nworking to pack our Federal courts with ideologically driven judges \\ngroomed and handpicked by ultraconservative organizations like the \\nFederalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.\\n  Donald Trump has already confirmed 85 judges, including 30 to circuit \\ncourts and 2 to the U.S. Supreme Court. These judges comprise one-tenth \\nof the Federal judiciary, with many more to come.\\n  In fact, a few weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 42--\\n42--judicial nominees out of committee in one markup. Those 42 comprise \\nan additional 5 percent of the Federal judiciary.\\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, Justice Kavanaugh issued a strong dissent in \\nthe earlier mentioned Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision to block \\nLouisiana's anti-choice law from taking effect. Using tortured \\nreasoning, Justice Kavanaugh essentially argued that the Supreme Court \\nshould disregard its own precedent from only 2 years ago--that is the \\nWhole Women's case I referred to--to allow the Louisiana law to take \\neffect. His dissent signaled his strong antipathy to a woman's right to \\nchoose, just as his dissent in Garza v. Hargan did when he was on the \\nDC Circuit. His dissent as a Justice this time demonstrated the \\nemptiness of his promises to uphold Supreme Court precedent during his \\nconfirmation hearing.\\n  Justice Kavanaugh's promises then to follow precedent is like that of \\nother Federalist Society-picked Trump nominees now packing our courts, \\noffering little reassurance that nominees in fact will set aside their \\nstrongly held ideological views to be objective and fair as judges.\\n  Another case likely to make its way through Federal courts in the \\nmonths and years ahead is a challenge to the Trump administration's new \\ngag rule. This rule prohibits doctors and other clinicians \\nparticipating in title X family planning programs from referring \\npatients for, or even speaking about, abortions, even if their patients \\nrequest such information.\\n  Nearly 20,000 Hawaii residents receive reproductive healthcare \\nthrough title X. That is roughly the population of the city of Kapolei \\non Oahu. This attack on title X-funded agencies like Planned Parenthood \\nis an end-run around Congress after Republicans have tried and failed \\ndozens of times to end funding for Planned Parenthood.\\n  Planned Parenthood provides healthcare for millions--millions--of \\nlow-income women, men, and young people under title X. Why then do \\nRepublicans persist in trying to cut funding for Planned Parenthood?\\n  The constitutional rights of millions of women across the country are \\nunder serious and sustained attack, but even in these not normal times, \\nI do see some hope. As State after State passes laws to limit access \\nfor a woman's right to choose, communities like Hawaii's are coming \\ntogether to protect such access.\\n  Last week, I joined activists and staff from Planned Parenthood of \\nthe Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands as they opened their new \\nmedical center and administrative hub in downtown Honolulu. I was \\nparticularly energized to see how many young people, women and men, \\nwere there and engaged in the fight to protect our right to choice.\\n  I have learned over the years that battles we fought so hard to win \\nnever stay won. It is up to all of us to stay engaged and keep fighting \\nfor our constitutionally protected rights.\\n  I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1599, text=\"  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want to be very clear about the matter \\nthat is before the U.S. Senate today. We are not here to debate \\nabortion. That is not what this bill is about that Senator Sasse has \\nintroduced. We are here to decide whether it should be legal in the \\nUnited States of America to kill or neglect an infant who has been born \\nalive after a botched abortion.\\n  This was made very real for me just minutes ago. In fact, Melissa \\nOdom is standing just off the floor of the U.S. Senate, just outside \\nhere probably 50 feet from where I am standing. She survived a botched \\nsaline-infused abortion in 1977. She was left to die, literally put in \\nthe medical waste heap, but thanks to the grace of God and a nurse who \\nsaw Melissa, they were able to revive her, and she is a beautiful 41-\\nyear-old mom with two children, one being Olivia who was born in the \\nsame hospital where the botched abortion took place. She is from Kansas \\nCity, married to Ryan.\\n  We are here to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection \\nAct. By now, we have all heard the disturbing defense of infanticide \\noffered by the disgraced Governor Northam of Virginia. These babies' \\nonly crime was to survive the abortionists' attempts to poison, starve, \\nor tear them apart limb from limb while in utero.\\n  What this bill is about is when the abortionist wants to ``finish the \\njob'' as the baby lies helpless on the table of an abortion clinic. \\nCurrently, children born alive who survive an abortion attempt are \\nrecognized as persons under the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of \\n2002, but that law is merely definitional because not one person to \\ndate has been charged or convicted under it. There is no nationwide \\nFederal law criminalizing the actions of killers, like Dr. Kermit \\nGosnell, who kill or deny care to babies who survive abortions. Current \\nFederal murder statutes have limited jurisdiction, and the States have \\na patchwork of different laws for born-alive infants.\\n  The bill we are voting on today would give Federal enforcement teeth \\nnationwide to the 2002 Born-Alive law, so that whether an infant is \\nborn alive in Montana or in Massachusetts, whether in a hospital or an \\nabortion clinic, they would be guaranteed the same protection and level \\nof care. Is that asking too much?\\n  By contrast, consider that Federal law provides criminal penalties of \\nthousands of dollars in fines and even imprisonment if you ``harass, \\nharm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect'' any \\nbaby marine turtle, baby bald eagle, or any other baby of an endangered \\nspecies.\\n  It is absolutely absurd that we are having to decide whether we give \\nhuman babies the level of protection under Federal law that we give to \\nanimals. This is truly an absurd moment on the floor of the U.S. \\nSenate. Have we become so numb as a nation that we cannot realize we \\nare talking about a baby?\\n  Cindy and I became grandparents for the first time on January 23, \\nlittle Emma Rae Daines, born in Denver. She is now a living, breathing \\nmember of the human family. That is what we are talking about here, a \\nliving, breathing member of the human family. Is it the position of the \\nDemocratic Party that a border wall is immoral but not infanticide?\\n  The phenomenon of infants surviving attempted abortions is very real. \\nThese infants are not just statistics. Their lives matter, and their \\nstories deserve to be told, just like the story of Melissa Odom. That \\nis why I am proud of\\n\\n\\nand grateful to my Senate colleague Ben Sasse, who has introduced the \\nBorn-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.\\n  Infanticide is not and should not be a partisan issue. It is an issue \\nin which there should be no middle ground or compromise. A ``yes'' vote \\ntoday is to uphold the bare minimum of any civilized society. A ``no'' \\nvote is to deny protection from barbaric violence to the most \\nvulnerable among us, an innocent, little baby.\\n  You can either stand with Governor Northam for infanticide or you can \\nprotect the most vulnerable among us.\\n  I yield back my time.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Foreign Policy & Military'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1601, text=\"  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from Montana \\nfor his powerful message. I can assure him that I believe strongly in \\nthe same approach as he does with regard to life.\\n  I rise to discuss an issue of vital importance to our society, and \\nthat is the intrinsic value of human life. Very shortly, every Senator \\nwill have an opportunity to stand up for human dignity and condemn \\ninfanticide when we vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors \\nProtection Act. This should not be a difficult vote for any of us.\\n  I believe in the value of every innocent human life, beginning at the \\nmoment of conception to natural death. Life is a gift from God that \\nshould be respected and treated with dignity from the very beginning to \\nthe very end.\\n  I have worked to enact pro-life policies throughout my time in public \\nservice based upon this principle. While working as Governor, I signed \\nlegislation to ban abortions in South Dakota, except when necessary to \\nsave a mother's life.\\n  ``Humanae Vitae,'' written by Pope Paul IV and later expanded upon in \\n``Evangelium Vitae,'' written by Saint Pope John Paul II the Great, \\nteaches that there can be no true democracy without a recognition of \\nthe dignity of every person. It goes on to teach that respect and \\ndignity must be given to each human life for true peace and freedom to \\nexist.\\n  We must demand respect for the rights of all. This includes those in \\nthe womb, as well as mothers carrying a child who are facing difficult \\nchallenges. Both deserve our utmost compassion and care. While this \\nshould be common sense to everyone, we recognize that in this country \\nthere are individuals who are pro-life and individuals who are pro-\\nchoice.\\n  While I and millions of other pro-life Americans continue to work to \\nend all abortions and support measures that strengthen the dignity of \\nlife, recent actions at the State level have been deeply troubling. \\nPro-choice individuals are actually now supporting measures that will \\nallow doctors to commit infanticide even after a baby has been born \\nalive. For example, last month, the State of New York repealed section \\n4164 of the State's public health law which provided protections for an \\ninfant born alive after a failed abortion. Subsequently, in Virginia, \\nlegislation has been introduced that would legalize abortion up to term \\nand even after the birth has begun. In Rhode Island, the Governor has \\nvowed to sign legislation legalizing abortion even after the child is \\nviable.\\n  These examples of abortion extremism at its worst--radical, abhorrent \\nacts of infanticide--should horrify all of us. While I am troubled by \\nthe thought of any baby being killed at any stage, at a bare minimum \\nevery one of us should be able to agree that infanticide--or the \\nkilling of a baby after it has been born alive--is unacceptable. This \\nis a separate issue from abortion, which is abhorrent in itself.\\n  In the history of the world, the true test of a society is how well \\nwe treat the most vulnerable among us. That is why we must pass this \\nlegislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, of which \\nI am an original cosponsor, and I would like to thank Senator Sasse for \\nbringing this legislation forward.\\n  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act simply protects \\nnewborns who survive abortions by requiring appropriate care and \\nadmission to a hospital. When a failed abortion results in the live \\nbirth of an infant, our legislation makes clear that healthcare \\nproviders must exercise the same degree of professional skill to \\nprotect the newborn child as would be offered to any other child born \\nalive at the same gestational age. A baby who survives an abortion \\ndeserves the same rights under the law as any other newborn baby and \\nshould receive proper medical care, not to be left to die or be killed.\\n  It is also worth mentioning that President Trump stood up for life \\nduring the State of the Union Address earlier this month, calling on \\nCongress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions of \\nchildren who feel pain in the mother's womb. President Trump urged:\\n\\n       Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes \\n     innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All \\n     children--born and unborn--are made in the holy image of God.\\n\\n  I couldn't agree more. All life is sacred. We must seek to protect \\nand save lives whenever possible, however possible.

The goal here is \\nobvious: to bully doctors out of giving reproductive care, to scare \\nthem out of business--one potential lawsuit or jail sentence at a \\ntime--making it even harder for women to get the care they need when \\nthey need it most, as the number of physicians available shrinks.\\n  This is just the latest step in the far right's long march to strip \\naway women's rights--a march whose pace has now quickened under our \\ncurrent President, a man who once argued that women should be punished \\nfor taking up their right to choose, who has taken pride in trying to \\nput the government between women and their doctors, and who just 72 \\nhours ago issued a gag rule that could gut family planning clinics.\\n  I have said this a thousand times before, and I will keep saying it \\nuntil I go hoarse: A woman's medical decisions should be between her \\nand her physician and her family and not dictated by some politician in \\nWashington, DC. When lives are on the line, the folks with MDs are the \\nones who should be deciding what care is appropriate, not those with \\npartisan agendas.\\n  Mothers and doctors know that every pregnancy is different--both of \\nmine\\n\\n\\ncertainly were--and physicians are trained with exactly this in mind.\\n  It is offensive and just plain ignorant for my colleagues to claim \\nthey know better than a doctor or an expectant mom. It shows an \\nalarming disrespect for a woman's moral compass and her ability to make \\nsound decisions.\\n  I can't begin to conceive of the pain of the mom-to-be who learns \\nthat the baby she already loves isn't viable and that the child whose \\nname she has already chosen and whose life she has already imagined \\nwill never open their eyes. All this bill would do is to sharpen that \\nfamily's suffering. All it would do is to make it harder for the next \\nwoman to get the care that could save her life. How dare we think of \\npassing legislation like that. How dare we put extremist politics over \\nempathy, over science, and over women's health and families' pain.\\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against S. 311--a bill that is \\nas heartless as it is dangerous.\\n  Thank you.\\n  With that, I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Health Care', 'Abortion'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1609, text=\"  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it has been interesting to hear the \\ndebate today about how heartless it would be to protect the life of a \\nchild. The debate from the other side has come out fast and furious, \\nsaying that S. 311 is about a child who is not viable and that somehow \\nwe are going to put a mom through more torment with a child that is not \\nviable.\\n  The plain text of this bill could not be clearer. This is not about \\nabortion. This is about a child who has been born alive and who is a \\nviable child.\\n  Here is the interesting conversation. Many people in this country \\nargue about abortion--rightfully so. We are talking about the life of a \\nchild. This, in particular, though, has a clear argument. What if an \\nabortion is botched, and instead of the child being killed in the womb, \\nthey are actually delivered? Now a child is on the table who is crying, \\nwith pink skin, 10 fingers and toes wiggling, and is reaching out. What \\nhappens now? That is the question with this bill.\\n  Interestingly enough, it is not the first time it has come before the \\nSenate. In 2002, this same issue came before the Senate. The Senate, \\nthe House, and the President all agreed that if an abortion was botched \\nand the child was delivered, that child is a child. By definition, that \\nis a child. In 2002, what that bill did not do is define what happens \\nnext if the life of that child is then taken after they are born.\\n  This wouldn't be an issue because it is clearly defined in law except \\nfor the fact that a few weeks ago, the Governor of Virginia made a \\npublic statement saying that we need to have a law to say that we could \\ndeliver a child, make it comfortable, and then decide what to do with \\nthat baby. Suddenly, this becomes a national conversation.\\n  We thought this was a resolved issue in 2002, but it is not. There is \\nstill debate from the other side saying: Deliver the child and then \\ndecide what to do with the life of that child.\\n  This is not just an issue that has no consequence as well. After that \\nbill was passed in 2002, the CDC started analyzing birth certificates \\nto determine if this happens and how often it happens.\\n  It doesn't happen often, but in a few number of States where the CDC \\ngathered information from, it determined there were 143 babies who were \\nborn alive after an attempted abortion and who then died with no record \\nof how it happened.\\n  Just in 5 months in 2017, the State of Arizona reported that 10 \\nbabies were born alive after an attempted abortion. This doesn't happen \\noften, but it does happen, and the question is, Who are we as a nation \\nand what are we going to do with a child who is in front of us who is \\nalive?\\n  Medical professionals are called to do no harm--the Hippocratic Oath. \\nIt is interesting to see medical professionals provide care to every \\nperson everywhere they go. If there is a car accident, it doesn't \\nmatter if it is their patient. They pull over and help. Interestingly \\nenough, at the State of the Union Address, just a couple of weeks ago, \\nwe had a staff member in the back who passed out, and Members of \\nCongress who are also physicians, who were in their seats, jumped out \\nof their seats to go provide care because that is what physicians do. \\nBut in the case of a botched abortion, the child is delivered and then \\neveryone who is a medical professional just steps back and watches the \\nchild die and doesn't provide care. It is the reverse of the \\nHippocratic Oath. We need to resolve this in our law.\\n  If I can even make a comparison. We as people, and even soldiers in \\nthe field, honor life. Soldiers who were trained to take life still are \\nalso trained to honor life.\\n  Article 12 of the Geneva Convention, which we support, says this: \\n``Members of the armed forces and other persons . . . who were wounded, \\nsick . . . shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.'' \\nLiterally, if you are in the fight of your life on the field, as our \\nArmed Forces are, and you run across a wounded individual in that fight \\nfrom the other side, we give care to that person, even though they are \\nour enemy on the battlefield. But in an abortion clinic, that child is \\nnot given the same care that we are demanded to give on the \\nbattlefield.\\n  This is a fascinating dialogue that I have had with a lot of my \\ncolleagues. For a lot of my colleagues who are pro-abortion and who \\ndon't see that as a life, I will often ask this simple question: When \\nis a life a life? What is your redline? I think that is a fair \\nconversation.\\n  For myself, it is conception. When that child is conceived and they \\nare developing, they have unique DNA. That is a different person. For \\nothers, they will say it is when the child is viable. For others, they \\nwill say when the child is born.\\n  I just ask a simple question. When the child is born, is that a \\nchild? Is your redline birth? This bill affirms that when a child is \\nborn, we should at least acknowledge that that is a person.\\n  I am a dad who has cut the umbilical cord of my own daughter before. \\nI would be terrified to say that the child was not a child until I, as \\nthe dad, cut the cord--that I could take that life at any moment before \\nthat. That is not who we are as Americans.\\n  Let's pass this. Let's protect living children.\\n  With that, I yield the floor.\", cat_list={'Abortion', 'Other'})\n",

This legislation would reduce families' access \\nto reproductive healthcare, interfere in personal medical decisions \\nthat should be left between families and doctors, and criminalize \\ndoctors and health professionals.\\n  Tonight's vote is part of a broader strategy by this administration \\nand some in Congress to take away women's access to reproductive \\nhealthcare, including the constitutional right to an abortion affirmed \\nin Roe v. Wade.\\n  For instance, the administration has already installed two Supreme \\nCourt Justices who threaten Roe v. Wade, repeatedly tried to de-fund \\nPlanned Parenthood and cut off family planning grants, and given \\nemployers the green light to take away birth control coverage from \\ntheir employees. In the last Congress alone there were 14 anti-women's \\nhealth votes and 34 anti-women's health bills introduced.\\n  Reproductive health choices are highly personal and deeply sensitive, \\nand they should be left between families and their doctor. S. 311 would \\neffectively overrule these personal decisions by imposing arbitrary \\nstandards--based on political ideology, not medical appropriateness--on \\nhealth professionals.\\n  This bill would effectively criminalize doctors and healthcare \\nclinicians for providing the best plan of care to their patients. It \\nwould impose civil and criminal penalties including up to 5 years in \\nprison onto providers if they don't comply with the bill's mandates. \\nThese mandates could scare medical professionals away from helping \\nwomen and families obtain reproductive care, including an abortion, \\nfurther reducing families' access to care.\\n  More than 17 of the Nation's leading medical, public health, and \\ncivil rights organizations oppose this bill. The American College of \\nNurse-Midwives, the American College of Obstetricians\\n\\n\\nand Gynecologists, and the American Public Health Association state \\nthat the bill ``. . . injects politicians into the patient-provider \\nrelationship, disregarding providers' training and clinical judgement \\nand undermining their ability to determine the best course of action \\nwith their patients.'' The American Civil Liberties Union states that \\nthe bill ``. . . shows a callous disregard for patients in need of \\ncompassionate, evidence-based care when they face difficult \\ndecisions.''\\n  The majority of Americans want more access to reproductive \\nhealthcare, not less. More than 7 in 10 Americans do not want women to \\nlose access to safe, legal abortion. In 1991, a majority of voters in \\nthe State of Washington passed the Washington Abortion Rights \\nInitiative, declaring that a woman has a right to an abortion.\\n  S. 311 is another misguided attempt to reduce women and families' \\naccess to reproductive healthcare.

      "Pandas(Index=1623, text=\"  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the order of the Senate of January \\n24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 6, 2019, the Senator from \\nNebraska, Mrs. Fischer, will now read Washington's Farewell Address.\\n  Mrs. FISCHER, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\\nTo the people of the United States:\\n  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a \\ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \\nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \\nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \\nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \\nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \\nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \\nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \\nbe made.\\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that \\nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the \\nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \\ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \\nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \\ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \\nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \\nthat the step is compatible with both.\\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \\nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \\ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared \\nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much \\nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \\nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \\nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \\nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \\naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \\nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \\nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \\nto abandon the idea.\\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as \\ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \\nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever \\npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \\ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \\nto retire.\\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \\nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \\nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \\nthe organization and administration of the government the best \\nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \\nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \\nexperience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \\nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every day the \\nincreasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade \\nof retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied \\nthat if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, \\nthey were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while \\nchoice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism \\ndoes not forbid it.\\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \\ncareer of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the \\ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \\ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for \\nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the \\nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \\nattachment by services faithful and\\n\\n\\npersevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have \\nresulted to our country from these services, let it always be \\nremembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals \\nthat, under circumstances in which the passions agitated in every \\ndirection were liable to mislead, amidst appearances sometimes dubious, \\nvicissitudes of fortune often discouraging, in situations in which not \\nunfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, \\nthe constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and \\na guarantee of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly \\npenetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave as a \\nstrong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the \\nchoicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly \\naffection may be perpetual; that the free constitution, which is the \\nwork of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration \\nin every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in \\nfine, the happiness of the people of these states, under the auspices \\nof liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so \\nprudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of \\nrecommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every \\nnation which is yet a stranger to it.\\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \\nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \\nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \\noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \\nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \\ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \\npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \\nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \\nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \\nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \\nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \\noccasion.\\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \\nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \\nthe attachment.\\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \\ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \\nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \\npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \\nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \\ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \\nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \\ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \\nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \\nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \\ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of \\nyour national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that \\nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; \\naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of \\nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation \\nwith jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a \\nsuspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly \\nfrowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any \\nportion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties \\nwhich now link together the various parts.\\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \\nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \\nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \\nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \\npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \\ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \\nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \\ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \\nliberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\\nof common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \\nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \\nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \\nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \\nUnion of the whole.\\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \\nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \\nthe latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial \\nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South \\nin the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees \\nits agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its \\nown channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \\nnavigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to \\nnourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it \\nlooks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself \\nis unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, \\nalready finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior \\ncommunications by land and water will more and more find a valuable \\nvent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at \\nhome. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth \\nand comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must \\nof necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its \\nown productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime \\nstrength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble \\ncommunity of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \\ncan hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own \\nseparate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any \\nforeign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \\nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \\nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \\nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \\nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \\nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \\nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \\nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \\ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \\nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \\nand embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those \\novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \\nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \\nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \\nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \\nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \\nother.\\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \\nand virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \\nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \\ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \\nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \\nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \\nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \\nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \\nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union \\naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \\ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \\ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \\nweaken its bands.\\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \\nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished \\nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \\nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \\nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local\\n\\n\\ninterests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire \\ninfluence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions \\nand aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves too much \\nagainst the jealousies and heart burnings which spring from these \\nmisrepresentations. They tend to render alien to each other those who \\nought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of \\nour western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. They \\nhave seen in the negotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous \\nratification by the Senate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the \\nuniversal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, a \\ndecisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them \\nof a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic states \\nunfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have \\nbeen witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with Great \\nBritain and that with Spain, which secure to them everything they could \\ndesire, in respect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their \\nprosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of \\nthese advantages on the Union by which they were procured? Will they \\nnot henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would \\nsever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?\\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \\nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \\ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \\ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have \\nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \\nyour first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better \\ncalculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \\nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \\noffspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \\ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \\nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with \\nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \\nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \\nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \\nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \\nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \\ntheir constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any \\ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \\nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \\npower and the right of the people to establish government presupposes \\nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \\nassociations under whatever plausible character with the real design to \\ndirect, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action \\nof the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \\nprinciple and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to \\ngive it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of \\nthe delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but \\nartful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to \\nthe alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public \\nadministration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects \\nof faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans \\ndigested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However \\ncombinations or associations of the above description may now and then \\nanswer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, \\nto become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled \\nmen will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for \\nthemselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very \\nengines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \\nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily \\ndiscountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but \\nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \\nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be \\nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \\nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \\ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \\nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \\ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \\nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \\nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \\nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \\nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \\nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \\nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \\nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \\nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \\ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \\nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \\nenterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within \\nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \\nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \\nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \\ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \\nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \\nparty, generally.\\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \\nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \\ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \\nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \\ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \\nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \\nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \\nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \\nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \\ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \\nabsolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some \\nprevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, \\nturns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the \\nruins of public liberty.\\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \\nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \\ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it \\nthe interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain \\nit.\\n  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the \\npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \\njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \\nanother, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door \\nto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to \\nthe government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the \\npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will \\nof another.\\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \\nupon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the \\nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \\ngovernments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, \\nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \\npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \\nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \\nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \\nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \\npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \\nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, \\nlest instead of warming it should consume.\\n  It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \\ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \\nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \\nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the\\n\\n\\nexercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The \\nspirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the \\ndepartments in one and thus to create, whatever the form of government, \\na real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power and proneness \\nto abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to \\nsatisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal \\nchecks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing \\nit into different depositories and constituting each the guardian of \\nthe public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by \\nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \\nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \\nthem. If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification \\nof the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be \\ncorrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. \\nBut let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one \\ninstance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by \\nwhich free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly \\noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which \\nthe use can at any time yield.\\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \\nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \\nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to \\nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \\nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \\npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \\ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \\nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \\nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \\nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \\ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \\nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \\neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \\nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \\nreligious principle.\\n  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary \\nspring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less \\nforce to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend \\nto it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation \\nof the fabric?\\n  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \\nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \\ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public \\nopinion should be enlightened.\\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \\ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \\npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \\nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger \\nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \\nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \\nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \\ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \\nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \\nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \\nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \\nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \\npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \\nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \\nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \\nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \\nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \\ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \\ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \\nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any \\ntime dictate.\\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \\nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \\ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \\nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \\nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \\npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \\ndoubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \\nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \\nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \\nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \\nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \\nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \\npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \\npassionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place \\nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \\nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \\nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \\nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \\nastray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against \\nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \\nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \\nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent \\ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, \\nprompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the \\ngovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government \\nsometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through \\npassion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \\nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated \\nby pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace \\noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \\nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \\nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \\nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \\nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \\nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. \\nIt leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges \\ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \\nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \\nretained and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to \\nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \\nit gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote \\nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \\ninterests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with \\npopularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of \\nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \\nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \\ncorruption, or infatuation.\\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \\nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \\npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \\nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \\nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \\nor weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the \\nsatellite of the latter.\\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \\nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \\nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign \\ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \\nthat jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \\ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \\nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \\ndislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \\none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \\nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \\nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \\nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \\ninterests.\\n\\n\\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \\nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \\npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \\nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \\nstop.\\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \\nvery remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent \\ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \\nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \\nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \\npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \\nor enmities.\\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \\ndifferent course. If we remain one people under an efficient \\ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \\nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \\ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \\nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \\nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \\nprovocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \\njustice shall counsel.\\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \\nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \\nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \\ntoils of European ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?\\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any \\nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \\nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \\ninfidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable \\nto public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best \\npolicy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed \\nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would \\nbe unwise to extend them.\\n\\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \\na respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \\nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \\npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \\nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \\nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \\nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \\ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \\norder to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \\nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional \\nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \\nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \\nabandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \\nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \\ndisinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of \\nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \\nby such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given \\nequivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \\ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \\nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \\nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \\ndiscard.\\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \\naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \\nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \\ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \\nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \\nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \\nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \\nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \\nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \\nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \\nwhich they have been dictated.\\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by \\nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \\nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \\nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least \\nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \\nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \\napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \\nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \\nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \\nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \\ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty \\nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \\ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \\nmoderation, perseverence, and firmness.\\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \\nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \\naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \\nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \\nadmitted by all.\\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \\nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \\nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \\ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \\nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \\nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \\nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption \\nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give \\nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \\nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \\ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \\nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \\nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \\nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \\nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \\nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \\nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \\nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \\nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \\ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \\nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \\npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \\ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \\nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \\nand dangers.\\n                                                      Geo.

Some 330 \\nmillion people are served by these critical centers, while handling 2.6 \\nmillion cases.\\n  In 2017, someone called a poison center roughly every 12 seconds in \\nour country. More than 90 percent of those calls were due to poison \\nexposure in someone's home, and more than half of all cases involved \\nchildren under the age of 12. That is why speedy access to poison \\ncenters is such an invaluable resource, especially for parents.\\n  Poison centers also save hundreds of millions in Federal dollars by \\nhelping to avoid the unnecessary use of medical services and shortening \\nthe length of time a person spends in the hospital, if hospitalization \\ndue to poisoning is necessary.\\n  It is clear that these centers are a smart public health investment, \\nbut they are also an integral part of our response to the opioid \\nepidemic.\\n  Since 2011, poison centers handled nearly 200 cases per day involving \\nopioid misuse.

This analysis is a call to \\naction to do all we can to protect these valuable insects, particularly \\nin the face of climate change.\\n  That's why today I am introducing the Saving America's Pollinators \\nAct. This legislation will suspend the use of certain insecticides \\nuntil they are thoroughly assessed and determined to be safe for \\npollinators. Furthermore, it establishes a monitoring network for \\nnative bees, and clarifies the emergency exemption powers that this \\nAdministration is afforded under current law.\\n  This law is much needed, and my hope is that with this new and \\nalarming information, Congress can finally act to adequately protect \\nour future food supply and agricultural and ecological health before \\nit's too late.\\n\\n\\n\", cat_list={'Budget & Economy & Jobs', 'Energy & Oil & Environment', 'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Health Care'})\n",
      "Pandas(Index=1650, text=\"  Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nick Gray of \\nOlathe, Colorado, a World War II veteran of Pearl Harbor and \\nGuadalcanal Campaign who recently celebrated his 100th birthday.\\n  Nick is the grandson of Judge John Gray, who took up a homestead in \\nthe Shavano Valley in 1884, became Mayor of Montrose, and received \\nlocal acclaim for working to get the Gunnison Tunnel built during his \\ntime as a District Judge. Judge Gray's son, Joe Gray, was Nick's \\nfather. Nick grew up on the family ranch his grandfather built with his \\nmother Addie Hobson, his father, and the rest of his siblings .\\n  In 1940, Nick left his family's ranch and volunteered to serve in the \\nArmy. He was stationed at Pearl Harbor with the 25th Infantry Division \\nwhen the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. While overseas he built \\nroads and bridges on Guadalcanal in the South Pacific and managed a \\ncrew of 25 natives who had been bombed out by Japanese forces. After \\nhis service was complete, he used his military education to build his \\nranching operation back home in Colorado and ultimately created the \\nNick Gray Construction Company.\\n  As a small business owner, he built more than 3,000 miles of power \\nline rights-of-way and roads across three states. In 1963, Nick cleared \\n220 miles for power line structure sites, building sub-station sites \\nand roads from Wyoming to New Mexico. Another one of Nick's major \\naccomplishments was building the Purgatory Ski Area near Durango, \\nColorado. Nick built the parking lot, ski course, and by-pass road all \\nthe way to Hermosa Park. During the 129-day project, he blasted nearly \\n40,000 yards of rock.\\n  Nick married his wife Margaret in June 1946, and they had a son, \\nStephen Gray. Nick and Margaret have two granddaughters, Nicole Lumsden \\nand Lezlee Cox, and six great-grandchildren, Keith Lumsden, Stephen \\nLumsden, Sarah Lumsden, Talli Lumsden, Caralea Cox, and Kendyl Cox.\\n  Madam Speaker, Nick's service to his country, enduring work-ethic, \\nand love of family will continue to have an impact on the Olathe \\ncommunity for years to come. It is my privilege to acknowledge him here \\ntoday, and express heartfelt gratitude for the important work he has \\ndone throughout his life. I wish him all the best in his future.\\n\", cat_list={'Foreign Policy & Military', 'Education'})\n",
